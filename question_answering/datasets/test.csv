B001FA1SSM,grocery,How would you rate the flakiness of the flakes?,"Back To Nature Summer Berry Blend Cereal comes in recycled, but attractive, packaging.  The see-through window allows you to see the contents.  The cereal seems to have the right amount of sweetness, but the flakes are too hard.  The freeze-dried fruit, what there is of it, is of a good size, delicious, tasty, and tart.  Strawberries are the most prevalent.  The taste is a bit unusual, but for organic cereal, it is OK.  Additional amounts of fruit and softer flakes would make this cereal more appealing. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(509, 523)"
B005IW4WEA,grocery,Where can I buy protein?,"This is my first experience with any sort of healthy grain snack. I have to say, I've become a fan. I find it difficult to enjoy healthier options because I do have such a sweet tooth but with the vanilla and the blueberry mixed in with these grains I don't miss the sugar. Plus, it helps to know that this snack is very healthy, not to mention quite tasty. When I think of healthy I don't usually think it will taste good as well.I've actually been looking for ways to add some sort of Omega-3 into my diet but it's been difficult because I don't like fish. This snack is full of flax seed which is full of the heart healthy Omega-3.When I first received the bag I thought, this reminds me of cereal. While reading the back label it actually say's you can add milk and have it just that way. I've yet to do that because I brought this product into work to have as a breakfast filler. It works perfectly for that as helps control your appetite. It fills me up and I feel good knowing it's a healthier option than what I'd usually go for.For me I'm so happy I found this product. Its low in sugar, full of Omega-3, and is made with 100% whole grains. They suggest trying this on top of yogurt or with milk. Both seem like delicious ideas that I can't wait to try.I am pleasantly surprised I like this. I'll definitely be getting it again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1338, 1352)"
B000FEH8ME,grocery,How about combination?,"I tried the wild blueberry organic pure bar.  It was okay.  The smell was overwhelmingly blueberry - almost synthetic smelling - but I checked and the product is all natural and all organic.  Our household is a Lara Bar household so it was interesting to compare this to our normal fare.  The PURE bar is very greasy, which I thought was kind of weird.  The taste was okay.  Not great.  There were nice chunks of nuts, much bigger than you would find in a Lara bar.  I definitely won't change brands, but it is nice to know that there are other options out there if you find yourself in a place that doesn't carry the Lara Bar.  You do have to know that these types of bars have plenty of fat, nuts and thus calories in them, a bit under 2 ounces and a bit under 200 calories.  They are much denser than your regular run-of-the-mill granola or fiber bar and they are definitely ""healthy"" tasting.  All in all, just okay.  I'm sticking with Lara Bars.

B00DS842HS,grocery,How does consistency feel?,"Yes....shaving!!I was given the opportunity to test out a full size jar of this stuff.  My initial thoughts were to use it somehow with baking or cooking or even a smoothie, but I just couldn't find the right application.  So instead I thought that I would give it a try as a health care/beauty item.First I tried it as a simple lip balm.  The smell and taste are smooth and mild.  However, given that the melting point for coconut oil is pretty low, this just didn't sit on my lips the way a traditional balm does.  Then I tried it as a shaving cream replacement at the suggestion of other users of coconut oil, and can I say WOW!  I have terribly sensitive, dry, itchy skin on my legs...so much so that I turn into a human version of a sasquatch from about October through May every year just to avoid the feeling shaving in winter gives me.  Traditional shaving cream and a follow up with traditional moisturizer just don't save me from days worth of skin irritation and itch, so for years every fall and winter my legs go in complete hiding.  BUT- this stuff saved me from that!  No days of itching after shaving, no wanting to take a steel wire brush to the backs of my knees from the razor burn sensation.  And it really got an excellent close shave and left my skin super soft for days.Downside- it's messy.  Again, that melting point plays a roll, but it doesn't drip off.  Instead, it will reharden in your tub unless you scour the tub immediately after shaving.  It's also not very easy to scoop out from the jar for this purpose.  However, none of these things take away from getting a great shave that doesn't make you want to peel off your skin for days after! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1674, 1688)"

Pure bars will be right up there with Larabars as raw organic food bars that taste great, come in a variety of flavors, and bring whole food nourishment.

B004FEJ968,grocery,Do you think that the oat is sweetness enough?,"I tend to favor fruit desserts and cookies and cakes over chocolate, so be aware of that as you read this review. I like Fig Newtons and all the different fruit Newtons, but I wasn't sure what to expect in these cookies. I was pleasantly surprised.Unlike Newtons, these cookies are very light and crispy. They're a bit delicate, and they broke easily, which is probably why they're packaged in plastic trays in the bag as opposed to simply being free roaming in the bag. I think if I were to put them in a ziplok bag, they'd all break into pieces. Not the sturdiest of cookies, but very delicately crispy.The flavor is good. There are bits of cranberries that aren't too big nor too small. The package says ""citrus"" and there are pictures of oranges on the front, but I thought these tasted more lemony than orangey. I think I would have liked more cranberry flavor and less lemon flavor. The cookie was also not too sweet, which I tend to like better. This was definitely less sweet than a chocolate chip cookie.The texture is nutty and you can definitely taste the whole grains and fiber, which I like, but which other people may not care for. It's also a drier cookie, not as oily as normal chocolate chip cookies bought at the store or on the grocery shelves. I tend to favor this, but other people used to more butter or lard might find the cookie a bit dry.I enjoyed eating these with sweetened tea. I really think this is my new favorite store-bought cookie. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1466, 1480)"
B0025UCHT0,grocery,How is the box?,"My youngest is a very picky eater.  Spaghetti is one of the only foods he will regularly eat.  But even there, he can be funny. He didn't like some of the whole wheat brands we had tried, said they tasted ""funny"".Thankfully, he had no such complaints about the Barilla.  And since it has extra fiber and protein, I will be buying more of this to help him get some more well-rounded nutrition.The rest of the family enjoyed it as well.  I found that after it sat awhile it got a bit less ""al dente"" than I usually like it, but upon reheating it tasted OK. Still, since most of our spaghetti leftovers go to my youngest, and since he enjoys the leftovers the same as our regular brand, that isn't really a problem for me.

B004FELBH8,grocery,How is the texture?,"Yum! These are a combination of all the things I like in a cookie. Texture like shortbread but a more interesting taste. (To the reviewer who complained that they are crumbly and break up in your mouth--that's what shortbread is supposed to do!) The honey is subtle, not too sweet, and the whole grains add some substance. The bits of fig and raisin are small--about the size of caraway seeds--and chewy. I was able to recognize the figs, but then, I like Fig Newtons, so I probably knew the flavor from that. Package says serving size is 3 cookies, but I found just 1 or 2 make a satisfying snack to nibble on without being too many calories or too much sodium. I'll probably buy these again.

B004JGQ15E,grocery,How is the snack?,"The Packaging: I box has 5 packs in it. Each pack has about maybe 50-75% as much popcorn in it as those small 99c bags of popcorn chips. The packs themselves are smaller than a 99c bag of chips; very portable.Taste: The fudge and caramel mix nicely. Its not overly sweet, and you get a nice fudge aftertaste as it melts in your mouth. Its not salty and doesnt leave any sticky residue on your fingers. Its alittle too crunchy and occasionally you run into uneatable bits of popcorn, which may be normal in regular popcorn but really shouldnt be in a sweet snack.Health: Each pack in the box has 130 calories, with 3g Fat, 24g Carbs, 18g Sugars.Verdict: There are healthier snacks that are cheaper than this but if you like popcorn, fudge, and caramel give it a try.

It does have little bits of aloe pulp floating in it.If that doesn't bother you, then give it a try. While perhaps a shade too sweet, the taste is pleasant - not too blah, not too strong. The passion fruit flavor is dominant, but if you pay attention you'll notice a little bit of green tea flavor too. It's fine for drinking on its own or with a meal or snack.(While some will surely play up the healthy nature of this drink, given all the great things green tea can do for you and that one can never go wrong with aloe, don't mistake this for a 'health' drink.

B0096RP84Q,grocery,How is the soup?,"I am reviewing the Creamy Red Pepper with Smoked Gouda soup.This soup was really good. I actually expected it to be a bit thicker, like a tomato soup, but this was like a slightly watered down tomato soup. There were generous amounts of chunks of tomatoes and red peppers throughout and spices visible throughout (parsley and basil?). The taste was great. Not too peppery, tomatoey, or cheesy, but just right.The instructions were simple and the bag was easy to tear at the indicated corner. 2-2.5 minutes, as indicated in the instructions, was perfect for the microwave I used at work so the soup came out hot, but not scalding hot where I had to wait to eat it. I just poured it right into a Tupperware container and it was perfect.I think this might be a more pricey route to go for soup at lunch than opening a can, but there's more soup in here than a small can as well. The flavors for these soups sound more interesting and appetizing than a typical can of soup. It's also nice that you can heat the pouch all together in the microwave then just pour into a bowl. However, you can't recycle these pouches (as far as I know) while you can recycle soup cans in most places...if that is something that is important to you.The Nutrition Facts are as follows: (apparently the serving size is 1C. but the pouch is 14 oz., so a pouch is almost 2 servings)Calories: 220Total Fat: 15gCholesterol: 60mgSodium 780mgTotal Carbs: 15gProtein: 6g ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1439, 1453)"

It's a definite treat to find them all in a one portion lunch kit.This has a good little selection of items in it, the salmon and crackers, a fruit and nut mix, dry roasted edamame, and a small piece of dark chocolate.  Although I was a little suspicious of salmon in a plastic container, it is tasty.  The salmon has a little kick to it that keeps it from tasting like tuna fish.  The dried fruit and nut mix are surprisingly good.  The edamame?  It's alllll riiiiight if you like that sort of thing.  Put enough salt on it and I'll eat it.  A small piece of chocolate brings this lunch to a sweet and dark end.I'm planning to get a six pack of these to keep in the car.

Even when bits of fudge fell off and I sampled it, there was no sugary sweetness, just a curious flatness and blandness reminiscent of tofu (soy is listed as an ingredient). The label also lists cocoa and brown sugar rather than milk chocolate. No wonder! Yet the drizzle is thick enough to make several popcorn kernals stick togehther in one huge lump.

B000FEH8ME,grocery,How did you like the packaging?,The texture reminded me of the center of a Fig Newton cookie but slightly moister. I would use these on a camping trip or hiking event but would not use on a daily basis.  The flavor was bland and I did not care for the texture which I found to be pastey.  Tended to stick to the roof of my mouth and was a little hard to swallow.  Did not get a distinct blueberry flavor. The most flavorful was when a bite would contain a nut.  The actual appearance of the bar is not appealing in the least.  I almost threw half of it away but then went ahead and forced the rest down.

B004FELBH8,grocery,How is it bag ?,"Okay, first, you need to know that I usually don't buy cookies, we try to really limit our sweets intake and we also try to eat things that are 100% whole grain, so cookies just don't fit into that, we also shop almost exclusively in the natural/organic section.  I love regular Fig Newtons, but stopped eating them when we started eating more whole grain and no/low sugar and over all healthier.  Also please know, I do not like crunchy cookies, I like soft cookies, period.  That said, I was surprised by how much I liked these.  They are thin and relatively crispy without being dusty/messy crispy.  I definitely taste the fig but not so much any honey, nothing wrong with that.  Over all the flavor is nice and there is enough flavor, some plain cookies of this type are just like sugary cardboard, but these have flavor.  I think I prefer the flavor of the cranberry ones to these because the flavor of these is not as strong and is warmer flavor than the citrusy cranberry ones.  Now, what surprised me the most, how not-that-bad-for-you these are.  There are no preservatives which is nice.  The first ingredient is enriched flour, but they do have some whole wheat flour and whole oats in them too, the are sweetened with sugar, not HFCS, and has fructose listed near the end.  We won't buy treats or sweetened cereal where a serving has more than 9 grams of sugar, and guess what?  These only have 7 grams of sugar per serving which is three cookies.  I will not at all feel bad letting my kids eat these cookies, especially since a serving for a preschooler would be one cookie.  I also like that they bag is re-sealable.  Now, while I said I preferred the cranberry flavor that preference is not enough to make but the cranberry ones over these and the reason is that the fig ones have one more gram of fiber and one less gram of carbs per serving, that little extra is enough that I'd choose the fig over the cranberry and why these got 5 stars instead of 4 like I gave the cranberry ones.

B002IEVJRY,grocery,How was it to taste?,"For the past few years, I have really been pleased with the results of Turtle Wax Ice All Wheel Cleaner for cleaning as well as bringing a sheen to my aluminum wheels however, as in the past I have used a variety of different products in the ongoing quest to find the ultimate shine while reducing the pernicious effects of disc brake dust I'm not averse to sampling competitive products...or innovative alternatives.  At first, I was taken aback by the darkness of this fluid as compared to most other wheel cleaners. It looked closer in pigmentation a vinyl and rubber restorer I used to use on the rubber trim of another vehicle decades ago.The container also is not very conducive to getting the chemicals into the nooks and crannies like the lug nut openings but transferring it to a spray mister seemed to solve that problem. The turtle wax spray bottle, by the way,  also has a very convenient brush scrubber attached to it which I used with this product as well so my results may have slightly skewed by turtle wax residue that no doubt has accumulated over time. (I can't say I'm real proactive about cleaning the brush when I'm done).  To be fair though, I did allow this solution, used full strength to sit on the wheels for about five minutes before scrubbing to give it the best chance to soak into some of the winter driving crud.Regrettably, I'm sad to report this variety of illy issimo failed miserably as an automotive cleaning product and will not be replacing my turtle wax ice as a wheel cleaner. My congealed brake dust is still there and although the wheels do appear cleaner, the brilliant luster I am used to is lacking. Plus, this can was so small I barely managed to work on two wheels.But, this concoction has a better chance of serving in that capacity than me ever taking another sip of it.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag was the amazingly strong ginger fragrance - it was so strong it was off-putting. I got my first whiff of lemon once I added the water. After stirring it up the fragrance mellowed a bit.The first sip was reminiscent of when I was on a juicing fast (fruits and veggies only) when I used Ginger in a drink recipe that I read online. It was strong and had a terrible after taste. This was exactly that. At first you can taste the lemon, and then you get the spicy kick all the way down your throat.

B005VOOKMY,grocery,Does the sauce a new taste?,"When I chose the Marley Coffee and Tea One Love coffee, I did not realize they came in ""pods"". (I don't even know what a pod brewer is and wikipedia was no help.) The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod.

I also appreciate that it's only 190 calories, versus the 220+ that many other bars give.OVERALL:Overall, I'm going to be buying a few packs of these in different flavors as soon as I finish this review.  I'm really glad I got the opportunity to try it, and I definitely recommend it if you like fruity and chewy bars and are looking for a high protein breakfast alternative.

B006MONQMC,grocery,How did you like the aftertaste?,"Water ""enhancers"", or ""energy"" drinks are all the rage now. So this new one by the stand alone company of Vitamin Squeeze, is entering a crowded market. Claiming to be an all natural flavored product, the list of ingredients on the bottle is pretty long (longer than the ingredients listed on both Amazon and the companies webpage). Vitamins A, B3, B5, B6, B12, and C have been ""added"", along with Taurine, Magnesium, electrolytes, and caffeine. Each serving squeeze flavors an 8 oz glass of water, and there are 24 servings in a bottle (or perhaps not - see below).To put this enhancer in perspective, a typical 1oz serving of espresso packs a punch of 40 to 75 mg of caffeine; 40 mg is what this water enhancer provides in an 8 oz glass. The added benefit with the squeeze is that you don't have to add calories via cream and sugar, and you've got a few vitamins thrown in as well. Another plus, is the convenience of simply squeezing in the flavor and caffeine.However, taste wise, the fruit punch tastes like sugar free gum. So yes, it's got that weird phony aftertaste that makes you screw up your face after drinking it. Another problem comes from the squeeze method per serving. One full squeeze delivers much more than is recommended, so each bottle comes no where near 24 servings.All and all, I'm going to stick to coffee and tea for my caffeine, and truly natural juices for my vitamins.

So, without knowing which granule is stevia and which is cane or if it's all mixed together, it's bad news for me. Within a few minutes of having some, my mouth and throat started getting itchy and irritated. Yikes!

I didn't recognize a bitter aftertaste like some other reviewers mentioned... and it seemed sweeter than regular sugar. Knowing it's natural is also a big plus.Unfortunately, that's all I can say about that.

No preservatives have been added. The label indicates 80 calories per serving, but defines a serving as 8 ounces. Because the bottle is 11.5 ounces, drinking a full bottle means an intake of 115 calories.Chantea won the Best New Product award in 2011 at the World Tea Trade Show. It also won Buyers' Choice and 2nd place Ready to Drink tea awards at the North American Tea Championship.Of the four available Chantea flavors (original, peach, lemon, passion fruit) I only tried passion fruit. My first reaction was surprise at the amount of pulp it contained. My second and sustained reaction was that the drink was tangy and tart - more than I would have liked. The taste is pleasant but rich and full-bodied - it reminded me of fresh grapefruit juice, but is a little sweeter.Although I may recommend it to friends and try another flavor, I am more inclined to drink acai blueberry vitamin water zero, which I find particularly delicious. However, these Chantea drinks offer a considerable additional benefit related to their aloe vera and green tea ingredients.Aloe vera is a succulent plant originating in Africa but now cultivated worldwide. Egyptian papyri reveal that it was used for healing as early as 16th century B.C.  Sources dating back to 1st century A.D. refer to its use in herbal medicine.Although no scientific evidence yet attests to its medicinal properties, aloe vera is widely associated with helping diabetes and elevated blood lipids, and improving glucose levels. It is most recommended for reducing symptoms of heartburn, irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and ulcerative colitis. It is an ingredient in yoghurt, and has no known side effects.Green tea, in contrast, has been the focus of dozens of scientific studies, although it has not been reviewed by the FDA. Made from the leaves of camellia senensis, which originated in China but is now cultivated worldwide, it contains antioxidative and anticarcinogenic flavonoids, as well as caffeine.Many studies suggest that:a) Lowers the risk of heart disease, cancer (breast, prostrate, colon), kidney stones, arthritis and dental cavitiesb) Boosts the metabolic rate 4-17%, helping reduce body fatc) Strengthens the immune system, and improves bone densityd) Reduces blood pressure and symptoms of depressione) Helps rescue damaged neurons and prevent brain cells from dying.Note however that the U.S. Pharmacopeia has warned that green tea in quantity does increase the risk of liver damage, especially when taken on an empty stomach. It is also contraindicated for use with the anti-cancer drug bortezomib, and it may reduce the effectiveness of anticoagulants.Those of you wanting a healthy, immune-boosting chilled fruity drink are likely to benefit from this product. However, taste is a very individual preference. If you like tart, full-bodied flavors, you may really enjoy Chantea's passion fruit green tea aloe vera drink.

Second, I LOVE chocolate and caramel--especially when combined together!  Third, I thought it would be fun to lampoon a research project for this review.With this knowledge in mind, I decided to take my bag of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates out to the Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital were I am a volunteer with the VA's diet and healthy lifestyle program, MOVE! (please go to [...] for information).  I did this for several reasons: 1) I knew that my personal prejudice might result in a skewed review; 2) at 290 pounds, I need to eat a whole bag of chocolates like I need another hole in my head; 3) I truly wanted to share the surprising bounty of getting a bag of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates with others; and, 4) as an experienced researcher, I could not pass up the opportunity to do a little ""research.""  Please let me make if perfectly clear that I fully acknowledge that this is NOT A SCIENTIFIC STUDY, which is why I surreptitiously entitled my review ""A 'Semi-Scientific' Survey....""  This is simply a fun way to share the wealth and get the opinions of others.  In this vein I will explain the ""methodological procedures"" I followed, as if this was a real survey.SAMPLE:  I offered a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to a total of thirty people, seven of whom did not take a piece.  All seven were VA personnel, one of which was allergic to chocolate.  The others stated that they either did not like candy (including chocolate) or, after reading the nutritional label, stated the caramel chocolates were ""way too fattening for me.""  There are four registered nutritionists (several with Masters degrees) in the Nutrition Department at Fort Harrison VA, Montana, where I volunteer.  Besides them and myself, there is a part-time staff worker, a physical therapist (with a Doctorate), a veteran CWT worker, and one other volunteer working with the MOVE! program, all of whom took part.  In addition to these eight individuals, I gave a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to four other VA employees and eleven randomly selected veterans/family members, for a total sample of twenty three people (not including myself--the 24th piece).  Out of this sample five stated that they did not really like chocolate and/or caramel very much (but were willing to sample the piece I offered them).  Three others, like myself, stated that they ""loved chocolate and caramel together.""TECHNIQUES: To collect my ""data,"" I cut each of the 12 pieces in half, and offered this sample piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to people at the VA, and asked them to tell me what they thought of the candy, recording their comments in my personal shorthand notes.  I then categorized each person into one of four categories that emerged from their comments: 1) liked the candy; 2) liked the candy, but...; 3) did not like the candy, but...; and 4) did not like the candy.  I have not bothered to do any data analysis.RESULTS:  Based upon the above categories, the numbers are as follows:Liked Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates:  17Liked Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates, but...  3Did not like Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates, but...  1Did not like Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates  2A few examples of comments made by those who liked the chocolates were: ""Very, very, very Good.  Delicious.  Smooth and rich.  And the smell is absolutely great!""  ""Loved it!  Really, really good.""  ""I like it!  The taste, the texture are great.""The two who liked the chocolate, but had reservations, commented:""Wonderful!  Very Good...It smells so wonderful.  Delicious, but one serving is half the recommended daily fat intake, and this one piece means I can't have any more fat today, as it is all my diet allows.""  ""They're good; better than their regular candy.  But it is too rich for me.""The one person who did not like the caramel chocolate, but had other thoughts stated: ""OK--especially if you like rich chocolate--but it is loaded with fat and just isn't tasty enough to compensate for all the fat in just one piece, let alone several.""The two who did not like the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates had this to say:""Chocolate and caramel are my two favorite candy flavors, and they smell delicious.  Yet, while they taste creamy, they have a noticeable waxy texture and taste that overrides the initial taste and flavor.  Overall, I am sad to say I don't like them, nor would I ever buy them now that I have tried them.""  ""No. I do not like it.  Way too buttery, fatty, and waxy tasting for me.""CONCLUSIONS:  Overall, approximately 80% of those who chose to try a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates liked them.  Hence, I have rated this four out of five stars.  It should be noted however, that a number of people did not even try the candy when they saw the fat content.  Of those who really liked the chocolates, only four asked if they could have another piece.  When asked if they would buy them, only six of the seventeen said ""maybe"" or ""yes.""  There was, HOWEVER, one universal response (including those who refused to try a piece) to the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates: ""They Smell Deliciously Wonderful.""For myself, the one ultimately responsible for this review, I found the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates disappointing.  I have tried to figure this out: why don't I like this brand of one of my favorite candies?  While I cannot say for sure, I think it is because the enticing smell and hopeful taste are lost to all the different types of butter/butter extracts and fats used in the mixture.  That is to say, I think they put too much into the mixture, and, while the smell may be powerful, I cannot taste the caramel chocolate mixture.  To me, then, Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates are simply a very rich and creamy (to the point of being overbearing or waxy) candy that has no distinctive taste.  So, I am glad I passed the pieces out to get other people's opinions, although at this time (April 4, 2009) this item is currently unavailable.  And I had a great time doing my ""research.""

B003FOA0VW,grocery,Where can I get a delicious thing?,"So, gluten free is becoming the new norm around here.  Many people are indulging in a gluten free lifestyle, some out of necessity and some out of curiosity.  I have friends who do this, and while some of the gluten free products available are palatable, I have found that more often than not they are off putting.  I was excited to see if this `care package' contained any pleasant surprises, but overall it just reaffirmed by previous belief; that gluten free is not for me.Let's take these one at a time.Blueberry Pomegranate Trail Mix Crunch:Flavor-wise, this is pretty good.  There isn't much in the package though, and the clusters are rather large.  They are also very sticky and leave a residue on your fingers.  Like I said, they tasted good (not very strong in the pomegranate flavor, but very nutty and blueberry tasting) but they also had a strong resemblance to `healthy cereal', so keep that in mind before purchasing.Multi-Seed Crackers:Crunchy and satisfying; these crackers taste slightly `healthy' but they also have some interesting flavors that give it a distinct and memorable taste.  I had to get used to them, but after a few bites I was hooked.Steak Nuggets + Cheese:This box contains a little meal.  The beef steak nuggets are a bit like jerky but they have a bland aftertaste.  They are chewy, but predictably so; despite the promise that they are `more tender'.  The Multi-Seed crackers are the same already provided in a larger bag.  When you lather on the Parmesan Peppercorn cheese spread, it takes those crackers to another level.  It's a great flavor, but I will say that it is a tad runny as apposed to creamy.  I'm kind of obsessed with ginger in general, so this Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix is phenomenally good.  I know that seems a tad excessive, but you can't go wrong with banana, cranberries and GINGERED PEANUTS!  Oh, and to finish off the `meal', you have an Almond Roca, which is always delicious.Sheffa Zesty Snack Mix:I was really excited about this.  The mix on the cover of the package looks amazing.  I've had chickpea fries before and I loved them.  Roasted corn and toasted seeds sounded like the perfect way to round out the snack.  Opening the package and peering inside I was turned off completely.  It looked like animal food.  The chickpea noodles are about five times smaller than they appear on the cover.  The taste is also extremely bland and almost too earthy.  It was kind of like chewing on twigs.  I think I've said enough about this one.Popchips, Barbeque Potato:Now these are kind of great.  They have a great airy texture that sits well on the tongue.  The flavor is strong on the outset, but one thing that is a slight detractor is that the flavor does dissipate quickly.  So, yes; the chips aren't perfect, but they are uniquely inviting, and that airy consistency really makes for a light and tangy snack.Sharkies, Watermelon Scream:There is an artificial flavor here that I'm not a gigantic fan of.  It kind of tastes like sugar substitute; a cloyingly sweet aftertaste.  That said, there is a lot of flavor here.  It is a robust flavor, so it has that going for it.  If you don't mind that faux-sugar taste then you should really enjoy these.  I could definitely taste the watermelon, which is nice (I love the flavor).Wild Garden Hummus:On its own, this garbanzo bean dip is a tad too; sweet?  I think that's the sensation I'm getting from this.  It just seems off.  It actually has an almost sour tang to it, like something that has gone bad.  But, when lathered onto one of those multi-seed crackers it is actually masked enough by the earthiness of the cracker to give off a pleasantly balanced bean flavor.Emergen-C Raspberry Fizzy Drink Mix:I love the taste of raspberries, but I have to tell you that I have a strong aversion to these types of drinks.  They always taste chalky and artificial to me and this one really isn't an exception to that rule.  It is void of much flavor, but it certainly smacks the back of your throat with that sweetened fizz.In the end, I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't need to cut gluten out of their diet.  It just isn't worth it.  But, if you need to find gluten free alternatives to foods you love, then this may be something you'll enjoy.  The Popchips and the crackers are pretty good, and those gingered peanuts are still calling my name. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4365, 4379)"

The lightly roasted Latin American arabica coffee beans are flavored with ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root, and the ambiguous ""natural flavor"" (which also includes corn maltodextrin and vegetable glycerin).

B001FA1SSM,grocery,How is the stuff?,"As a middle-aged male, I'm not ashamed to say I really enjoy these types of cereals. My wife and I try to eat as healthy as possible, so this cereal appealed to me since I've had similar cereals by other brands. I think this is a far superior product than many others I've tried.The flakes in this cereal are very thick and very crunchy. They maintain their crunch even after sitting in milk for about five minutes. The flakes are coated in flavoring, and the primary flavor is honey. It's a pleasant honey flavor -- not bitter and not too sweet. The box claims that vanilla extract is used -- although I can only taste the slightest hint of vanilla. Overall, the flavor is good and after eating a bowl, there's only a slight honey aftertaste.It's important to note that this cereal contains dried strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. The raspberries and blackberries are typically whole, while the strawberries are halves, quarters, or just pieces. They hydrate when they sit in the milk, and they have a good texture -- and they don't fall apart. Unfortunately, the quantity of berries is low -- expect about less than 5% by volume per box. When you pour a bowl of cereal, you might get 2 or 3 berries in the bowl, per 1-cup serving.From a nutritional standpoint, I'm satisfied but there is room for improvement. The calorie content is slightly higher than I expected -- 210 calories per 1-cup serving. Depending on what type of milk you use, a single-serving can be 250-300 calories. Fat content is only 0.5g.  Carbohydrates are somewhat on the high-side: 46g total per cup, with 5g of dietary fiber (20% for a 2,000 calorie diet). I attribute the high carb content to the sugars -- the flakes contain ""malted barley syrup"", ""evaporated cane juice"" and ""molasses"", while the second overall ingredient listed is ""brown sugar"".  If they could cut back on the sugar content, this product could be perfect.Overall, this is a quality product that I enjoy. I would not eat this every day, but it is good 2 or 3 times per week. Great flavor and texture, but just a few too many calories for me to enjoy every day. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2118, 2132)"
B009WPKGQC,grocery,How is the balance?,"My wife and I are bona fide ""chiliheads."" In our home corner of the desert Southwest, quite near the world-famous chili pepper fields of Hatch, New Mexico, chilis make up a major part of the local culinary scene. The Chili Pepper Institute at New Mexico State University, just up the road in Las Cruces, cultivates ever-hotter varieties of chili peppers from around the world. One of their latest finds is the Bhut Jolokia, which is many times hotter than the jalape&ntilde;o. In fact, we don't even buy jalape&ntilde;os any more--they're far too mild. Instead, we always have hotter serranos on hand to sprinkle on just about every meal, as well as our annual 30 pounds of roasted Hatch hot green chilis. We also always have a few bottles of hot pepper sauce in the pantry. Currently three bottles of Tabasco are in there--regular, garlic and haba&ntilde;ero. Thus, as a certified chili pepper fanatic, I leaped at the chance to try Gringo Bandito hot sauce when it showed up as a Vine selection.I've never been that impressed with hot sauces other than Tabasco. I prefer the clean, simple formulation of the classic products from Avery Island, Louisiana. Many of the other hot sauces we've tried in the past have had long lists of ingredients, which just dilute the pure chili pepper goodness. Gringo Bandito hot sauce is a happy medium. It has more ingredients than regular Tabasco, but not as many as some other brands--or, indeed, as the haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, which has everything in it but the kitchen sink. Gringo Bandito's extra ingredients are all good. Near the top of the ingredient list are ""haba&ntilde;ero peppers, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, red Japanese chili peppers, more peppers...""So how does it taste? Well, taste is of course highly subjective, so if I say, ""It tastes great,"" that doesn't really mean anything. What's great to me may be horrible to someone else. Right up front, Gringo Bandito has the characteristic, distinctive, unmistakable haba&ntilde;ero taste. And it IS very hot. A few dollops added excellent flavor and spiciness to black-eyed-pea soup and Polish hunter's stew. In a side-by-side taste test with haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, some differences stood out. Gringo Bandito is less hot than Tabasco, and it has a more one-dimensional flavor profile. In the comparison, it seems a little ""bland"" (as much as that can apply to a haba&ntilde;ero pepper sauce).But I don't mean that as a complaint. In fact, based on how it transformed the dishes we tested it in, Gringo Bandito is a tasty hot pepper sauce that will find a permanent place in our pantry, right next to the Tabascos.

It has a good balance of carbs and fat with the protein as well, and because it is tasty, it's easy (even desirable) to eat. It leaves me feeling full and alleviates any tendency to head for the vending machine or candy jar. The chocolate held up well in both my regular carry bag and my lunch box, and wasn't even too mushy after being left in a warm (not overly hot) car.

B006MONQMC,grocery,How is the packaging of the soup that you bought?,"If people bought ""energy"" drinks solely on the basis of taste, the market for these products would shrink pretty quickly because most of these drinks have no definable taste profile and mostly taste like diluted Kook-aid.

The product description suggests this is an energy/vitamin drink that will enhance your health. The packaging and flavor descriptions (e.g., ""fruit punch"") suggest this stuff is a kids' drink along the lines of Kool-aid injected with a jolt of caffiene.I tried to ignore the marketing buzzwords completely and focus on the taste and the convenience factor. In terms of taste, if you ignore the flavor listed on the label, you'll have a tough time describing what this product actually tastes like. It's definitely not fruit, and it doesn't taste like any punch I'd consume. I'd say it tastes kind of sweet and mostly artificial. It's drinkable, as long as your expectations are very low and you're OK with a drink that is red and sweet and not much more.The packaging is pretty cool, though, and portioning is easy - which is why a product like this exists.

B00HHFWJS2,grocery,How is the possibility like?,"I considered giving the product 2 stars, but I decided to go with 3, because I know some kids that no matter how hard the parent tries, they don't eat their vegetables. So my first suggestion is always, try very hard for your child to eat vegetables, prepare them in many different ways until they like them.Carrots should be easy enough, they are sweet and crunchy, most kids love that.So lets get back to the product.- 1 packet provides about 2 servings of vegetables. However, based on their recipes, and a normal amount a kid would eat, they might get 1/2 a serving of vegetables in the end. Which while better that nothing, amounts to not much more. 1 big carrot has more calories and nutritional value than 1 whole packet of these carrot blend ins.The mac and cheese recipe was pretty good, you can feel it adds a little bit of sweetness and thickness to the sauce, any kid that likes mac and cheese would most likely love it too, and don't really know what it had. This is why I gave it 3 stars instead of two.Given that each packet doesn't have much nutritional value, and that we are in fact hiding veggies from children, I feel like it's a counter productive product. And worth it of 1 or 2 stars max. But because I know some children that simply refuse to eat veggies, this is a way for them to get a little bit in their diet.Additional, the packets don't have extraneous ingredients, just pure vegetables, so it's not a typically junk packet.Again - only recommended for those parent that have tried every other avenue to get their children to eat vegetables and are at a complete loss of what to do.

We both took a couple of bites of this dip, and didn't finish.  It's okay in a pinch, but a little too hot (spicy) with an odd flavor that covers up the salmon.  It's also a very strange almost gel-like consistency that we didn't like, most likely from the corn starch.The crackers were good, although they are white flour instead of whole grain, and we very rarely eat white flour, even though they were organic.We don't eat a lot of soy due to the health issues, especially GMO soy which this probably is, but we did taste the edamame for this review.  They were dry without much flavor.The Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix was a little odd.  It tasted okay, but was an odd combination of dried banana chips, ginger peanuts, and dried cranberries.  Not our favorite fruit & nut combo.The chocolate was decent, although not as good as Endangered Species dark chocolate.

B008I1XLDQ,grocery,What do you think about variety?,"I love myKeurig B145 OfficePROcoffee maker. While I know it's not politically correct, as I stated in my in other reviews of K cups and the machine itself, this is one of my few bad habits, so deal with it.Now that Keurig's patent has expired, everybody is jumping on the ""K cup bandwagon."" Many of these new entries are priced considerably lower per K cup than those that use ""Official K Cups"" licensed from Keurig. So how do you tell if any of these roasters make a blend worth drinking? Sample packs of course! It's the perfect way to try blends from a roaster you may not have heard of. With that in mind I was pleased to find this sample pack from Brooklyn Beans. Having two or three samples of several blends makes it fun to compare and contrast Brooklyn Beans with those from other firms, especially the standardbearer, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.The MethodI prefer ""fuller flavored"" coffees while Mrs. Boilermate will drink just about anything. To evaluate these blends both Mrs. Boilermate and I sampled each blend. I drink my coffee with half and half and sugar while she drinks hers black. Even with these differences we generally agreed on the final result. This is how we evaluated this sample pack: The B145 allows you to make a six, eight, or ten ounce cup. If there were three samples of a blend other than ""extra bold,"" I made a 12 ounce cup using 2K cups and 6 ounces of water each, and Mrs. Boilermate made a cup with one K cup and 8 ounces. If there were only two samples of a blend we both made them with 8 ounces of water. The only exception was for blends marked ""extra bold."" These were all made with one K cup and 10 ounces of water. All flavored coffees were made with one K cup and eight ounces of water.So, how do the Brooklyn Beans blend stack up? Well, not surprisingly, we both brought some were very good, some are were average, and others we wouldn't drink again if someone stuck hot needles under our fingernails.The CupsThese cups (the container, not the coffee) are as good as any K cups out there. They mimic the style of Keurig's K Cup, and this is not a bad thing, as each capsule keeps the coffee fresh until you brew it. None of the cups in my sample pack were crushed, split, or damaged in any way. They fit my machine perfectly, pierced cleanly, and worked as designed.AromaWhile the coffee was brewing, most blends had little discernible aroma. The only notable differences here were the Breakfast Blend and the Breakfast Blend Decaf. Both of these filled the room with delicious coffee aroma while the coffee was brewing. In the cup, the aroma was pretty good for most blends. A notable exception here was the Corner Donut Shop Blend, which smelled burnt.TasteFrom a taste standpoint, there were more hits than misses. Surprisingly, we both rated the Colombian blend only ""Okay."" Normally, this is a blend most roasters seem to be able to do quite well. The most liked blends were Fuhgeddaboutit, Breakfast, and Breakfast Decaf. The biggest miss was the Corner Donut Shop Blend that not only tasted weak but smelled burnt, as previously noted, and also tasted burnt. While Cyclone is billed as ""extra bold"" neither of us thought it was particularly bold. My notes said, ""A bit weak for a dark, extra bold roast. Three out of five stars."" Mrs. Boilermate said, ""Okay, but not worth paying a premium for.""I'm not generally disposed to flavored coffees, but these flavored roasts were pretty good. Mrs. Boilermate thought so too with the exception of Cinnamon Subway, to which she commented, ""Cinnamon doesn't go with coffee."" OTOH, I thought it was a good combination.  I was skeptical about what maple in coffee would be like, but I thought the Maple Sleigh was a really good blend. It was my favorite of all the flavored coffees.SourcingThere is nothing on the package or on Brooklyn Beans' website that indicates where they source their beans from. Given a choice, we prefer to buy our coffee from roasters whose beans are sourced from certified Fair Trade (or similar organizations) suppliers, and we are willing to pay extra for it. Roasters who use such beans normally highlight this as a selling point. Since there is no such mention by Brooklyn Beans I would assume they are not.Bottom LineBased solely on price and taste, Brooklyn Beans blends compete favorably with other brands of K cups. Fuhgeddaboutit and Breakfast Blend compared very favorably to our current favorites, GMCR's Dark Magic and Colombian respectively. With a few exceptions, the sample pack was well-liked in our household. At the time of this writing they cost about $.55 apiece, which is about the same as we pay for Green Mountain K cups, but finding competitively priced single blend packs in the varieties we like is a bit more challenging.Given the choice between roasters who use certified Fair Trade or similarly certified beans and those who don't, we will normally choose those that do. Having said that, some of Brooklyn Beans' blends will make it into our rotation. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5004, 5018)"

I don't know if I truly felt the effects of the ""best available pH"" (9.5). It did have a pretty silky feel to it as I drank it.

The bar had good dark chocolate taste, typical aftertaste, a bit of grit (not a bad thing)and generally an excellent experience.  The difference between this bar and most other dark chocolates I have tried was how creamy the texture was as I was chewing it.  Reminded me more of a Hershey's bar in consistency...  Perusing other folks' reviews, I saw several mentions of the taste being bitter.  Assuming that folks weren't eating these right after dinner - I am wondering if there are any issues with quality control - since I only had the one bar to try, that is only a thought!!!All in all... I thought the bar was excellent, uniquely creamy and soft versus my normal dark chocolate bars, and left me wanting more.

B004BKLHOS,grocery,How is the texture?,"We mostly eat healthy foods--I'm a vegetarian and my husband tries to make sure we eat enough fruit and vegetables every day. However, both of us are quite fond of anything sweet, and I really enjoy a few cookies after dinner each night. The Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers fit both of these requirements--good for you and sweet!The crackers are a natural brown color, lightly sweetened with visible pieces of oats. They don't have any artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors--the sweetness comes from the graham flour and evaporated cane juice (which is really just sugar). There's no high fructose corn syrup or hydrogenated oils, which are two things I try to avoid.The crackers are crisp, but not overly crunchy--you don't get the same ""snap"" that you do from a regular graham cracker. They also crumble in a slightly different, but not bad way, from a regular cracker. When we first tried the crackers, we thought they weren't sweet enough, but then we realized that was probably because we were used to the hyper sweetness of a recent Oreo splurge! The second time we tried the crackers, we found them quite good--sweet but not cloying. The crackers are a little bit dry, I think that is because of some of the missing artificial ingredients. As I usually eat cookies or crackers with a cup of tea, it was not an issue for me--it actually makes them a bit more enjoyable.The package is made from 100% recycled paperboard, and it is not overly large compared to the actual product inside, which is a nice change. We will definitely buy these crackers again, we are happy to find a sweet tasting treat that is not filled with sugar and artificial ingredients. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1685, 1699)"
B000FEH8ME,grocery,How is sugar?,"I eat a lot of protein bars.  I'm always looking for one that packs high protein, low carb, great taste, organic, and gluten-free.  This one seems to cover most of those bases, though I can't say that I would run right out and buy one.  The protein is low for what I need to get out of the 48gram bar and the carbs fair to high, in comparison.  The blueberry comes through wonderfully, but the heaviness of the rice protein muddies it, leaving the overall bar a bit flavorless.  That it is organic is a plus, and I notice that it specifically says on the wrapper ""Certified Organic.""  What concerns me is that it does not say, ""Certified Gluten-free.""  This would be of particular interest to someone with Celiac disease, especially since it does not say it is wheat-free and notes that the bars are made in a facility that processes wheat.All-in-all, if you're not dealing with food allergies, the bar is OK.  You can certainly find more flavorful ones with more protein and less carbs, for less money.  The price of these is unarguably ridiculous.

Others have noticed that it is very sweet, and it is more sweet than black tea normally is.

B006MONQMC,grocery,What is the cost of the service?,"If people bought ""energy"" drinks solely on the basis of taste, the market for these products would shrink pretty quickly because most of these drinks have no definable taste profile and mostly taste like diluted Kook-aid. Fortunately for companies like the aptly named Vitamin Squeeze, buyers have been so conditioned by the giant beverage companies (e.g., Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc.) to accept gawdawful concoctions falsely marketed as ""flavors"" that what the product actually tastes like is of little or no concern when the purchase decision is made.It's hard to tell what the makers of ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink"" want you to think of their product. The product description suggests this is an energy/vitamin drink that will enhance your health. The packaging and flavor descriptions (e.g., ""fruit punch"") suggest this stuff is a kids' drink along the lines of Kool-aid injected with a jolt of caffiene.I tried to ignore the marketing buzzwords completely and focus on the taste and the convenience factor. In terms of taste, if you ignore the flavor listed on the label, you'll have a tough time describing what this product actually tastes like. It's definitely not fruit, and it doesn't taste like any punch I'd consume. I'd say it tastes kind of sweet and mostly artificial. It's drinkable, as long as your expectations are very low and you're OK with a drink that is red and sweet and not much more.The packaging is pretty cool, though, and portioning is easy - which is why a product like this exists. Just fill an empty bottle with water, squeeze in a little concentrate, shake, and you've got a cheap energy drink in seconds.If Vitamin Squeeze can produce a drink that tastes like something grown, not manufactured, I'd have this stuff stacked to the ceiling in my pantry.

My initial thoughts were to use it somehow with baking or cooking or even a smoothie, but I just couldn't find the right application.  So instead I thought that I would give it a try as a health care/beauty item.First I tried it as a simple lip balm.  The smell and taste are smooth and mild.  However, given that the melting point for coconut oil is pretty low, this just didn't sit on my lips the way a traditional balm does.  Then I tried it as a shaving cream replacement at the suggestion of other users of coconut oil, and can I say WOW!  I have terribly sensitive, dry, itchy skin on my legs...so much so that I turn into a human version of a sasquatch from about October through May every year just to avoid the feeling shaving in winter gives me.  Traditional shaving cream and a follow up with traditional moisturizer just don't save me from days worth of skin irritation and itch, so for years every fall and winter my legs go in complete hiding.  BUT- this stuff saved me from that!  No days of itching after shaving, no wanting to take a steel wire brush to the backs of my knees from the razor burn sensation.  And it really got an excellent close shave and left my skin super soft for days.Downside- it's messy.  Again, that melting point plays a roll, but it doesn't drip off.  Instead, it will reharden in your tub unless you scour the tub immediately after shaving.  It's also not very easy to scoop out from the jar for this purpose.

B001FA1SSM,grocery,How is the stuff?,"As a middle-aged male, I'm not ashamed to say I really enjoy these types of cereals. My wife and I try to eat as healthy as possible, so this cereal appealed to me since I've had similar cereals by other brands. I think this is a far superior product than many others I've tried.The flakes in this cereal are very thick and very crunchy. They maintain their crunch even after sitting in milk for about five minutes. The flakes are coated in flavoring, and the primary flavor is honey. It's a pleasant honey flavor -- not bitter and not too sweet. The box claims that vanilla extract is used -- although I can only taste the slightest hint of vanilla. Overall, the flavor is good and after eating a bowl, there's only a slight honey aftertaste.It's important to note that this cereal contains dried strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries. The raspberries and blackberries are typically whole, while the strawberries are halves, quarters, or just pieces. They hydrate when they sit in the milk, and they have a good texture -- and they don't fall apart. Unfortunately, the quantity of berries is low -- expect about less than 5% by volume per box. When you pour a bowl of cereal, you might get 2 or 3 berries in the bowl, per 1-cup serving.From a nutritional standpoint, I'm satisfied but there is room for improvement. The calorie content is slightly higher than I expected -- 210 calories per 1-cup serving. Depending on what type of milk you use, a single-serving can be 250-300 calories. Fat content is only 0.5g.  Carbohydrates are somewhat on the high-side: 46g total per cup, with 5g of dietary fiber (20% for a 2,000 calorie diet). I attribute the high carb content to the sugars -- the flakes contain ""malted barley syrup"", ""evaporated cane juice"" and ""molasses"", while the second overall ingredient listed is ""brown sugar"".  If they could cut back on the sugar content, this product could be perfect.Overall, this is a quality product that I enjoy. I would not eat this every day, but it is good 2 or 3 times per week. Great flavor and texture, but just a few too many calories for me to enjoy every day. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2118, 2132)"

Nowhere near as good as even the most basic scratch-made casserole, but decent if you set the benchmark as a mass-market box meal.The nutritional, caloric and fat components make this something you would not want to have as part of your regular diet. It's not horrible when it comes to nutrition, but there's not any bright spots either.The sodium content is very high -- you'll want to give this a pass if you are on a sodium restricted diet.I found that adding broccoli florets made the texture and flavor more interesting, and also cut down on how salty it was.

The cookies themselves were heavy on the oats and quite generous with the chocolate (but not the almonds).  Each cookie was quite substantial and just two of them with milk could be a satisfying meal.The cookies were soft and chewy, but not at all gooey, like eating a jelly bean or peanut butter.  The oat content had good consistency and the total cookie was pleasing to nibble on.Would I buy the product if given the chance?  Probably not, as it is not a good dippin' cookie.

If you like caffeine and water then this may be your thing. Drink it to get a lift.But for me I will drink my filtered water and have a nice slice of ice cold watermelon to give me my lift for the day and I bet I will enjoy it a lot more than drinking this.Now I must say that as I am writing this my heart is reacting to the caffeine, so be careful if you are sensitive.  If you are not then this is the drink for you,.As a fellow reviewer said ""go buy caffeine tabs and mix with tap water' they are cheaper and don't waste plastic bottles.

B00934WBRO,grocery,What is the salt crunch?,"I think it's important to place a product in context before assessing its value and, in my opinion, this is not the sort of thing that is meant to substitute for the real deal. A fresh apple is going to beat a processed snack any time. However, sometimes, it's not feasible to have fresh fruit on hand or you need something which will travel well and not weigh you down as much. This is good to have in your desk, a backpack, or in your car for a quick snack, but it is essentially dried apples in a different form. If you like dried apples a little, you may like this just a bit more.The main selling point of this over dried apples is that it's crunchier and the little round balls are more fun to eat. They have an intense apple flavor brought on by the apple bits and the concentrated apple juice. The juice gives them a fair amount of sweetness and the little morsels are held together with potato starch. The main disappointment I have with these is that the cinnamon is far too subdued. This is my personal preference, of course. I didn't really detect any cinnamon until around the 3rd bite when it had built up enough intensity on my tongue to be present.If you like dried apples, these may do it for you. They are intense, but all dried fruit is. I thought they were okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have them again. Some snacks are the type of thing that I'd eat if someone offered them to me, but I wouldn't tend to buy them for myself. This is one of those. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1479, 1493)"

In my opinion, unless you have some side dishes, most folks will want more than one eighth of the chicken. Really, it's that good. The only thing I would change would be to reduce the amount of salt in the seasoning. The package lists 300mg of sodium per serving, so the whole dish includes 2,400mg of sodium.

I like Fig Newtons and all the different fruit Newtons, but I wasn't sure what to expect in these cookies. I was pleasantly surprised.Unlike Newtons, these cookies are very light and crispy. They're a bit delicate, and they broke easily, which is probably why they're packaged in plastic trays in the bag as opposed to simply being free roaming in the bag. I think if I were to put them in a ziplok bag, they'd all break into pieces. Not the sturdiest of cookies, but very delicately crispy.The flavor is good. There are bits of cranberries that aren't too big nor too small. The package says ""citrus"" and there are pictures of oranges on the front, but I thought these tasted more lemony than orangey. I think I would have liked more cranberry flavor and less lemon flavor. The cookie was also not too sweet, which I tend to like better. This was definitely less sweet than a chocolate chip cookie.The texture is nutty and you can definitely taste the whole grains and fiber, which I like, but which other people may not care for. It's also a drier cookie, not as oily as normal chocolate chip cookies bought at the store or on the grocery shelves. I tend to favor this, but other people used to more butter or lard might find the cookie a bit dry.I enjoyed eating these with sweetened tea.

The package is easily portable, does not require refrigeration and easily microwaves in a mere minute.  Simply pull back the cover to the marked line, microwave, then pour the sauce on the pasta.  Although the packaging indicates that the microwaved product will be hot, my finished product was just right - not scalding hot like most microwave meals tend to come out.  But then, I used an 800 watt microwave.But when all is said and done, the product is edible and not much more.  The ""meat"" sauce contains small traces of something that could be meat, but I'd need a microscope to be sure.  The sauce itself is a bit too bland to cover up the odd taste of the pasta itself (which said pasta stubbornly refuses to stay on the fork).  And even if you enjoy the meal, you'll only be able to do so for about five or six bites.  While the portion size may be the ""proper"" size for what people actually need, I don't think that most people, especially men, will find the portion size satisfying or hunger abating for long (although, to be fair, it's no smaller than most such single-serving microwave meals).Overall, I would have expected better from Barilla (which I swear by for most pasta needs), but if you're doing a working lunch and just need to get some quick sustenance, this will do as well as anything.

I can report that it did just that; I didn't even think about food until after 12 PM.

The list of ingredients starts with Gluten-Free Oats with Organic Agave as the second ingredient; the agave is also known as the Century Plant. The third ingredient is a rice blend which includes some rice flours, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum. Walnuts were pretty far down the list and I don't recall encountering any chunks of walnuts. There was, however, a warning for people with allergies that the product was processed on equipment that makes other products that use peanuts and other tree nuts, soy and milk.From a nutritional perspective each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat, 15 mg of cholesterol, 140 mg of sodium, 2 grams of dietary fiber, and 2 grams of protein.I enjoyed my bar with a cup of coffee and found it sustained me all morning.

They love anything with cheese in it so that was a plus from the beginning.  The directions are easy and you can substitute different meats for the chicken breast, which--besides 2 1/2 cups of water--is the only thing not included in the box.  I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say ""simmer & stir often"", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.  It is hard to see and it does not have that lovely green look like it does in the picture.  I'd really just call it the Cheesy Chicken Skillet dinner and not even include the broccoli.Flavor was decent, although a little salty if you eat more than a servings-worth.  The kids loved it, of course...it's CHEESY!  It wasn't bad for my taste buds either.

It lacks the bitterness I might otherwise assume with many cold coffees but it does leave a metallic aftertaste (as well as what seems to be grapefruit).Pour:I'm pouring it into a mug and I am pleasantly surprised with how concentrated the coffee seems to be. It pours dark and thick and even leaves a little frothiness on the side of the container I'm pouring into. The coffee still leaves a bit of a metallic aftertaste, however.Look:As mentioned, the coffee is dark... really dark. I would think that if you like weaker coffee, you could dilute this and be fine with the results. I actually like my coffee stronger and this fits the bill pretty nicely.Aroma:This actually smells like fresh brewed coffee. Again, this surprises me.Overall:I'm really impressed by the quality of this product. Regarding my own biases, I usually brew my own coffee using fresh ground beans in a Chemex or a pour-over. This won't give you the same quality as that sort of process (obviously), but I would stack this above other cold coffee canned drinks I've had.

The bar is temperature sensitive, such that on a warm day it clings a bit to the wrapper and you may find yourself having to eat it out of the wrapper carefully.Also, the ingredients list is endless, and many many types of sugars are present:  evaporated cane juice, fructose, corn syrup, sucralose, sugar and maltilol, sugar alcohol and oligofructose. Once I read this list, I had two conclusions:* These appear to represent the manufacturer's desire to avoid high-fructose corn syrup at all costs, and to find sweet but lesser caloried ingredients. A for effort.* There are so many manufactured ingredients in this bar, it kind of defies the simple-food movement toward fewer ingredients.Ultimately, I thought it might be better to just eat an orange if you are looking for a snack with sweetness and some vitamins.P.S.

In this regard it is an epic fail.  The ""bowl"" bag has a red strip that you pull which supposedly causes the top of the bag to open widely into a bowl shape.  I could not manage to pull the top red strip in the way shown on the package, and instead had to rip the entire top of the bag off.  I had to then pour the popped corn into a big bowl to eat it, the same as any other microwave popcorn.  I consider myself very handy at most such tasks too.  This simply doesn't work the way it was intended to.The popcorn is almost delicious if you like a lot of salt on it.  There is no butter flavor at all that I could detect, but since I never put butter on my popcorn I didn't miss it, but still, I was expecting to taste at least a bit of butter in this.This fully popped and was almost starting to burn in the microwave in under two minutes, although the directions say to pop it for 2 - 2.5 minutes.Even if I had managed to get the top of the ""bowl"" open as directed, there was no flat bottom on it that would have allowed it to stand up on its own.  The taste of the popcorn is very good however so for that I gave it two stars.  There were more unpopped kernals than I would have liked.I don't recommend this.

B005VOOKMY,grocery,How is the cost of this coffee?,"Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

B004OQ257C,grocery,How is the aftertaste?,"OK, I consume a lot of Splenda every day.  I eat some in my morning Oatmeal, and I always make it a point to get the Diet Coke with Splenda in it, rather than the aspartame stuff.I have been getting the fiber splenda.  One gram of fiber per packet didn't seem to be much, but it was something to make the sweetener less empty, and it eliminated the gram of dextrose used to stretch the Splenda to make it measure. You occasionally see the tablets of Splenda, but they are rare, and they don't work on oatmeal.So I asked my wife, ""Please surprise me by switching to the Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants some morning over the next week.""  She agreed. On the third morning, I noted an odd taste in my cereal.  Not unpleasant, just odd.I asked her, and she confirmed, that was the first morning she had used the Antioxidant Splenda.So, unlike the fiber splenda, the antioxidant Splenda has a taste.Now, I normally only put sweetener in my coffee if it is nasty tasting.  But I don't have any nasty tasting coffee, so I put the antioxidant Splenda sweetener into regular coffee just to see if I can taste it.I am pretty sure I can taste it, but it is not a blind taste test.  I am going by what I taste in my oatmeal.As I've said, the taste is minor and not unpleasant.  It is hard to detect when I put one packet into 8 ounces of coffee.My opinion is that Splenda is the best artificial sweetener on the market.  The worst tasting is aspartame, then stevia because of the odd licorice overtone. Then saccharine, and that only when a small amount of saccarine is used.  I used to make ice tea with a half gallon of strong tea and one saccharine, and at that ratio, it was not bad.  It took the bitter edge off of the tea.If you can get cyclamates, they go here, and then, at the top, Splenda. Nothing tastes like sugar, especially not corn syrup, but splenda has the most neutral sweet taste of the artificials.  Now that it is available, I try not to use any of the other artificials, and I am not supposed to consume a lot of sugar.So plain splenda would get five stars as an artificial sweetener.  Essentials with fiber would get the same score. Antioxidant gets 4 stars because it has an off taste that is not a bad taste and because it is detectable other than sweetener. I believe that even with this off taste it tastes better than saccharine.  So it loses one star for the detectable taste, but not more.This sweetener comes in a heavy, stiff, hard to tear bag, that could probably survive being kept in a wallet in the rain without damage, and the bag is stiff and strong enough that someone with bad arthritis might not want or be able to use the sweetener in the bag.

The pyramid pouch is attractive but I think other fibers decompose more quickly and would prefer those or a reusable strainer.  It's not a deal breaker, just an observation.  If you like the scent, you can use it unbrewed as a sachet I guess.  Being that it's a fruity herbal tea or tissane, I personally find that it needs no sweetening and I've yet to add milk.  It's lovelier as an iced brew for my preference, and I think the vanilla essence is lacking unless I steep the tea for a longer time than usual.  I also have found that a single brew is best as opposed to a second dip which is possible for other tea bags.  The tea isn't bad, I just think it's average and haven't awarded it a higher star rating.  If you are looking for a fruity tea that is even better iced, give it a try.  I'd bet that kids would like this tea, and would encourage this over a soda or high calorie juice.

Why not? I could just zip the bag back closed. Well, I tell you, I had to sit down right there and pour myself a bowl with milk. Wonderful. And now we have something that can be sprinkled over greek-style non-fat plain yogurt, which he IS supposed to be eating more of. The evaporated cane juice provides just the right hint of sweetness without being too much sugar, and the high level of fiber will certainly be a boon to healthy dieters. The flax seed is an added benefit for heart health.My 60-year-old teeth are sensitive and weaker now than they used to be, so I often have difficulty chewing some of the granolas. This Kind blend is chewy and substantial, but not so hard that it's risky for me to try to eat it out of hand. Softened with milk, it's no problem at all. I'm not on a gluten-free diet, but I have friends who are, and this product would be just fine for them. The mix of whole grains has an interesting texture and taste, and the whole blend tastes so good I'd warn you not to sit down with the whole bag in front of the TV. It WILL be gone before you know it.Cost is my only problem with this product, but not because it's not worth the money. Healthy food costs more than junk, as it should, and it's clear to me that Kind is very healthy indeed. We're on low fixed income, though, so this would have to be an occasional splurge item for us, used more as a condiment on aforementioned yogurt than as a complete meal. I can stretch $5 worth of beans or chicken a lot further than I could one of these 11 oz. bags. I might, though, try it mixed in with oatmeal.In short: It's good food.

It doesn't absorb sauce well and it takes forever to drain the liquid adequately.  I made my normal meat sauce, drained the pasta for three minutes, put the pasta into my sauce and cooked it for another three minutes.  That should have absorbed the extra water but unfortunately, it did not.  My sauce (which I made extra thick) turned watery on the plate once served.However, having said that, the pasta itself tasted great; as good if not better than a regular pasta.  I wish there were a way to reduce the liquid without having the pasta get mushy (over cooking in the sauce) or cold (by draining for extended periods.

Each quarter-cup serving (quite small; there are just 4 servings in the tiny bag) is 60 calories, with no fat, 10 grams of natural sugar, and 2 grams of fiber.Okay, so these apple clusters are generally healthy, but I found the taste to be disappointing.  The clusters are small and round, and I found them to have a pleasant crunch.  However, I detected somewhat of an odd flavor; to me, it tasted almost like mustard, but perhaps it was just the particular apple variety?

When I saw the Prima Rendang, I was anxious to try it, as I've made this before from recipes I found online.If I found a restaurant that served this, I would buy it, weekly. It's SO tasty, a nice fresh bright clean tasting curry, flavorful without tasting like it has too much salt or sugary sweetness. It tastes like I ground the spices and made the paste myself, it's THAT fresh. I have never made a curry this good at home before.PRO*Easy to make (see tips below) with a payout that is restaurant-quality. You could serve this to guests and they would want to marry you!*The sauce is generous enough that you could easily feed 4 people or a little more if you put in some extra veggies. I sliced up some green onions and I think peas would be good in it, or some grated radish or even a little potato if that's your thing.*Prep time is very fast*Everything you need for the sauce is in the box*All the spices and chilies are so perfectly balanced, you get a total experience of the curry and not just a few spices standing out more than others. It was honestly hard for me to pick out separate flavors, such was the harmonious balance. If I had to guess what spices were in it, that would be hard to do. Wonderful blend. They are listed on the box as: Chili, galangal, onion, shallot, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, ginger, lemon grass, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper, cinnamon. I think they forgot to add ""crack"" into their list, I'm already jonesing for another bowl of this.CONS*The bits of leaves in the sauce kept interfering with my enjoyment of the dish. I know they are important to impart that fresh bright taste, but I felt like I was chewing my cud. It was like having bits of lawn clippings in my food and was annoying. I think this could be offset by using more veggies than I did.*The coconut powder can be lumpy and grainy, see tips belowCOOKING TIPS*The sauce thickens quickly and wants to stick to bottom of pan, I'd cook the meat to ALMOST done and then combine with the sauce.*Mix the coconut powder and water together, and then whisk in the paste. My coconut powder was lumpy as heck and left a grainy texture and bits in my gravy. Or, save the coconut powder for another use and just sub in a can of your favorite coconut milk. Eliminate or drastically reduce the water if you do this, try the can of coconut milk first and if you need more moisture add in a little water.*Use coconut oil to cook the meat in, it adds a nice flavor to the sauce.*this makes a LOT of food. Especially if you add more than just meat, you could easily feed over 4 people with it. I froze an extra serving to see how it stood up to the process, and it didn't separate. Package your leftovers into lunches or future dinnersNUTRITION INFO: Typically I see coconut powder with sugar of some kind added, but this only lists maltodextrin. The Rendang Paste does have palm sugar and sugar listed in the first few ingredients. Just the box ingredients have 75 grams of carbohydrate, with 45 grams of that coming from sugar. That's a lot of sugar bang for the buck.  The entire box also has 1650 calories, 135 g. of fat, with 105 of that being non-animal saturated fat from the coconut. The entire box also has 3450 mg of sodium. Let's face it though folks, no one is going to sit and eat the entire box. (I know, I tried!)If the sauce weren't grainy from the bits of coconut powder, I would give this a 5-star rating. I would love to see this sold as a paste packet or jar, so that I could use my own coconut milk brand. This curry paste is SO amazing, I would love to be able to buy it by the jar and use it on ribs, burgers, chicken, etc.UPDATE: Using the tips to preblend the coconut powder, my second batch was smooth. This also does work with a can of coconut milk, omit the water. This product is available on Subscribe and Save, and it was so good that I signed up to get regular shipments of it. When I have bad bad food cravings and am tempted to go drive out to get something, now I always have this on hand and it is so satisfying! It's good with chicken, beef, and pork.

This friend had also thought thatVitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch Energy Drinkwas ""really good"" while I wasn't exactly enthralled with it as can be seen in my review, so it just goes to show that tastes can vary, and widely so.And as far as taste goes, the back of the avitae water container says it all: ""What does purified water with natural caffeine taste like? Like nothing."" And that's the most accurate beverage description that I've seen in a long time.  So what's to like about it? Plenty of zeros, as you can see here:- Calories: 0- Total Fat: 0g; 0%- Cholesterol: 0g; 0%- Sodium: 0g; 0%- Total Carbohydrates: 0g; 0%- Protein: 0g; 0%- Vitamins and minerals: 0g; 0%- Caffeine: 90mg; about the same as a medium-brewed cup of coffee.The surprise here was that it looks and tastes just like it was described: water.  There's no carbonation, no sugar, no calories, no artificial sweeteners, and no additives... and that's why I find so appealing. So is there a downside? Yes, it's that this isn't the most cost-effective way to buy water and/or any caffeinated beverage, but it's no worse than most of the others here.For me the 90mg caffeine is just right for a quick pick-me-up, but for those who want half the kick, there'savitae 45 Mg Caffeinated Water, the 'low-octane' version with about as much caffeine as a diet soda... but again: no carbonation, no sugar, no calories, no artificial sweeteners, and no additives.To summarize this, there are plenty of ways that you can get your caffeine boost listed here if you take a moment to search for them. I've been a bit harsh on some of them, but this one is a winner, and if you want just that pure clean taste of water but with a little jolt, avitae's caffeinated water is hard to beat.6/27/2012 ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2009, 2023)"

It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy.

When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4938, 4952)"
B004FEN3GK,grocery,What is the package?,"I was already familiar with the Honey Maid crackers and always enjoyed them. The flavor is always consistently good. This option is better because the box contains six individually wrapped packages with about eight or ten crackers in each pack. It's great because you don't have to open the whole box with worry about the remainder of the crackers getting stale. The individually wrapped packs would also be good for snacking on the run. It's easy to just grab a package of these and put them in your purse for later. The only drawback is that sometimes eight crackers is just more than desired for a snack and there is no way to really seal the bag to save them for later.

B008I1XLDQ,grocery,What do you think about variety?,"I love myKeurig B145 OfficePROcoffee maker. While I know it's not politically correct, as I stated in my in other reviews of K cups and the machine itself, this is one of my few bad habits, so deal with it.Now that Keurig's patent has expired, everybody is jumping on the ""K cup bandwagon."" Many of these new entries are priced considerably lower per K cup than those that use ""Official K Cups"" licensed from Keurig. So how do you tell if any of these roasters make a blend worth drinking? Sample packs of course! It's the perfect way to try blends from a roaster you may not have heard of. With that in mind I was pleased to find this sample pack from Brooklyn Beans. Having two or three samples of several blends makes it fun to compare and contrast Brooklyn Beans with those from other firms, especially the standardbearer, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.The MethodI prefer ""fuller flavored"" coffees while Mrs. Boilermate will drink just about anything. To evaluate these blends both Mrs. Boilermate and I sampled each blend. I drink my coffee with half and half and sugar while she drinks hers black. Even with these differences we generally agreed on the final result. This is how we evaluated this sample pack: The B145 allows you to make a six, eight, or ten ounce cup. If there were three samples of a blend other than ""extra bold,"" I made a 12 ounce cup using 2K cups and 6 ounces of water each, and Mrs. Boilermate made a cup with one K cup and 8 ounces. If there were only two samples of a blend we both made them with 8 ounces of water. The only exception was for blends marked ""extra bold."" These were all made with one K cup and 10 ounces of water. All flavored coffees were made with one K cup and eight ounces of water.So, how do the Brooklyn Beans blend stack up? Well, not surprisingly, we both brought some were very good, some are were average, and others we wouldn't drink again if someone stuck hot needles under our fingernails.The CupsThese cups (the container, not the coffee) are as good as any K cups out there. They mimic the style of Keurig's K Cup, and this is not a bad thing, as each capsule keeps the coffee fresh until you brew it. None of the cups in my sample pack were crushed, split, or damaged in any way. They fit my machine perfectly, pierced cleanly, and worked as designed.AromaWhile the coffee was brewing, most blends had little discernible aroma. The only notable differences here were the Breakfast Blend and the Breakfast Blend Decaf. Both of these filled the room with delicious coffee aroma while the coffee was brewing. In the cup, the aroma was pretty good for most blends. A notable exception here was the Corner Donut Shop Blend, which smelled burnt.TasteFrom a taste standpoint, there were more hits than misses. Surprisingly, we both rated the Colombian blend only ""Okay."" Normally, this is a blend most roasters seem to be able to do quite well. The most liked blends were Fuhgeddaboutit, Breakfast, and Breakfast Decaf. The biggest miss was the Corner Donut Shop Blend that not only tasted weak but smelled burnt, as previously noted, and also tasted burnt. While Cyclone is billed as ""extra bold"" neither of us thought it was particularly bold. My notes said, ""A bit weak for a dark, extra bold roast. Three out of five stars."" Mrs. Boilermate said, ""Okay, but not worth paying a premium for.""I'm not generally disposed to flavored coffees, but these flavored roasts were pretty good. Mrs. Boilermate thought so too with the exception of Cinnamon Subway, to which she commented, ""Cinnamon doesn't go with coffee."" OTOH, I thought it was a good combination.  I was skeptical about what maple in coffee would be like, but I thought the Maple Sleigh was a really good blend. It was my favorite of all the flavored coffees.SourcingThere is nothing on the package or on Brooklyn Beans' website that indicates where they source their beans from. Given a choice, we prefer to buy our coffee from roasters whose beans are sourced from certified Fair Trade (or similar organizations) suppliers, and we are willing to pay extra for it. Roasters who use such beans normally highlight this as a selling point. Since there is no such mention by Brooklyn Beans I would assume they are not.Bottom LineBased solely on price and taste, Brooklyn Beans blends compete favorably with other brands of K cups. Fuhgeddaboutit and Breakfast Blend compared very favorably to our current favorites, GMCR's Dark Magic and Colombian respectively. With a few exceptions, the sample pack was well-liked in our household. At the time of this writing they cost about $.55 apiece, which is about the same as we pay for Green Mountain K cups, but finding competitively priced single blend packs in the varieties we like is a bit more challenging.Given the choice between roasters who use certified Fair Trade or similarly certified beans and those who don't, we will normally choose those that do. Having said that, some of Brooklyn Beans' blends will make it into our rotation. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5004, 5018)"

I have to say, my entire family was disappointed, for several reasons.  My kids did not like the card board taste or texture of the crackers.  They tasted stale and overly grainy and left a very dry taste in your mouth.  I did not like them because each cracker has 7 grams of fat and 220 mg of sodium per serving.

Other than the fact that this Crackerful offers some whole grains in their ingredient list, they have the same nutritional value and caloric intake as the ""non-multigrain"" versions that Nabisco makes, and at least the other flavors, like the Four Cheese, taste much better than their whole grain counterpart.  We ended up throwing out the remaining packs that we did not sample, and I will not be buying the whole grain version again.

The box claims that there are 19g or more per serving of whole grains in these crackers and lists the serving size as 8 crackers or 2 full cracker sheets. Following is per-serving nutritional information for those who care:Calories: 110Total Fat: 2.5gMonounsat: 1.5g (the other gram of fat is not accounted for that I could see)Sodium: 130mgPotassium: 85mgTotal Carbs: 22gDietary Fiber: 2gSugars: 8gProtein: 2gWhen compared with Nabisco Honey Maid Lowfat Cinnamon Grahams, these crackers have less calories, sugar and sodium than the Honey Maid Grahams. Honey Maid also uses HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) and partially-hydrogenated oils which these do not. These crackers are sweetened using sugar, honey, evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup, apple juice concentrate and raisin paste whereas Honey Maid uses honey, molasses, HFCS and dextrose.TASTE AND TEXTURE:TEXTURE: I found these crackers much more delicate than a standard graham cracker. There was a moderate to substantial amount of breakage from the shipping process. I found the dividing line for each cracker (within a sheet) much less discernable than a standard brand of graham crackers. I also found these crackers really dry--moreso than a regular brand. I'm assuming both of these things are because Back to Nature is trying to make a healthier cracker, but that's just my guess.TASTE: This is being sold as an Apple Cinnamon flavored graham cracker. For me, there was far too little graham flavor in these crackers and the cinnamon flavor was very lacking as well. The taste reminded me of a cross between bran muffins with raisins and bran muffins with dehydrated apples. There seemed to be some taste difference between the various sleeves of crackers.SUMMARY:If finding a healthier graham cracker is your primary concern, these may be your best bet.

The bar is temperature sensitive, such that on a warm day it clings a bit to the wrapper and you may find yourself having to eat it out of the wrapper carefully.Also, the ingredients list is endless, and many many types of sugars are present:  evaporated cane juice, fructose, corn syrup, sucralose, sugar and maltilol, sugar alcohol and oligofructose. Once I read this list, I had two conclusions:* These appear to represent the manufacturer's desire to avoid high-fructose corn syrup at all costs, and to find sweet but lesser caloried ingredients. A for effort.* There are so many manufactured ingredients in this bar, it kind of defies the simple-food movement toward fewer ingredients.Ultimately, I thought it might be better to just eat an orange if you are looking for a snack with sweetness and some vitamins.P.S.

It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing.

I wish there were twice as much tea in each bag, for starters; this is a bit weak, and I use big mugs. I wish there was more pu-erh than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces) per bag. I wish that it was good for multiple re-steepings, as most pu-erhs are. A few more t-bags per box would be very nice too, or a lower price tag.In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals ""eeew"".

(The cookies, not the testers!  :-) )  They are about two inches across, maybe an eight of an inch thick, and are a darker brown than shown on the package.  Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.The taste of the ""outside"" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit ""grainy"", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.  I give these cookies a three star rating ... that is to say they're not good, they're not bad, they're only fair.As an aside, I received these cookies to evaluate as part of the Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon shipping container was very well protected and undamaged, but when I opened the pack of cookies, about a third of them had been reduced to crumbs, and only two thirds of them were in a condition to eat.  (And those were all stuck together.)  I don't know if that was due to rough handling or excessive heat during shipment, so I didn't consider it as part of my rating.  I only mention it as something to watch for in the event that it's a flaw in the cookie itself. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1924, 1938)"
B009WPKGQC,grocery,How is the balance?,"My wife and I are bona fide ""chiliheads."" In our home corner of the desert Southwest, quite near the world-famous chili pepper fields of Hatch, New Mexico, chilis make up a major part of the local culinary scene. The Chili Pepper Institute at New Mexico State University, just up the road in Las Cruces, cultivates ever-hotter varieties of chili peppers from around the world. One of their latest finds is the Bhut Jolokia, which is many times hotter than the jalape&ntilde;o. In fact, we don't even buy jalape&ntilde;os any more--they're far too mild. Instead, we always have hotter serranos on hand to sprinkle on just about every meal, as well as our annual 30 pounds of roasted Hatch hot green chilis. We also always have a few bottles of hot pepper sauce in the pantry. Currently three bottles of Tabasco are in there--regular, garlic and haba&ntilde;ero. Thus, as a certified chili pepper fanatic, I leaped at the chance to try Gringo Bandito hot sauce when it showed up as a Vine selection.I've never been that impressed with hot sauces other than Tabasco. I prefer the clean, simple formulation of the classic products from Avery Island, Louisiana. Many of the other hot sauces we've tried in the past have had long lists of ingredients, which just dilute the pure chili pepper goodness. Gringo Bandito hot sauce is a happy medium. It has more ingredients than regular Tabasco, but not as many as some other brands--or, indeed, as the haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, which has everything in it but the kitchen sink. Gringo Bandito's extra ingredients are all good. Near the top of the ingredient list are ""haba&ntilde;ero peppers, jalape&ntilde;o peppers, red Japanese chili peppers, more peppers...""So how does it taste? Well, taste is of course highly subjective, so if I say, ""It tastes great,"" that doesn't really mean anything. What's great to me may be horrible to someone else. Right up front, Gringo Bandito has the characteristic, distinctive, unmistakable haba&ntilde;ero taste. And it IS very hot. A few dollops added excellent flavor and spiciness to black-eyed-pea soup and Polish hunter's stew. In a side-by-side taste test with haba&ntilde;ero Tabasco, some differences stood out. Gringo Bandito is less hot than Tabasco, and it has a more one-dimensional flavor profile. In the comparison, it seems a little ""bland"" (as much as that can apply to a haba&ntilde;ero pepper sauce).But I don't mean that as a complaint. In fact, based on how it transformed the dishes we tested it in, Gringo Bandito is a tasty hot pepper sauce that will find a permanent place in our pantry, right next to the Tabascos.

I thought there was plenty to spread around on the crackers, which had a nice light taste and satisfying crispy texture.  The cookie is satisfactory for what it is, not too sweet, but very thin, dry and crumbly; mine was pretty much a pile of cookie pieces.  The seed and fruit trail mix is great!  I like the tropical fruit strip well enough to eat it, but it was probably my least favorite component.Total calories as listed on the outside of the box is 490, with 52 carbs, 27 grams of fat (6 g saturated), and 9 grams of fiber.  You'll also get 20% of your daily iron needs and 10% vitamin C.  Total weight is 3.6 ounces, so this is a fairly calorically dense meal for the amount of food you're actually eating.  I don't know how long this would last if eaten during an active day (I ate again within three hours of eating my GoPicnic, so it lasted that long for me), so it might be more appropriate as a snack when hiking, biking, or any other high energy activity when one is travelling and/or out and about and not near home or other food source.As for the nutritional breakdown of the individual components, only the sunbutter, fruit strip, and crackers have an individual nutritional label on their specific package.  The cookie and trail mix are both Enjoy Life products, and their respective packages, while not having specific information, indicated that nutritional information could be found on Enjoy Life Foods' website.  The ingredients of all components are provided on the outside of the GoPicnic box, so you don't have to tear the box open for that information.The crackers have 60 calories, the sunbutter has 200, and the fruit strip has 70.

My only criticism--the foil packages are a bit narrow at the top, so it becomes somewhat challenging to reach the treats as you get to the bottom of the pack--a more square and less rectangular package might have worked better.

The Lipton K-Cup Iced Tea/Lemonade cups are very simple and easy to use.  Simply place the K-Cup in the machine, fill the water reservoir with water, heat and place a large mug (not glass) of ice beneath the brewer and press your choice of brewing size.  I added a bit more ice after brewing was complete, since much of it melted with the hot liquid brewing.  The flavor was very clean and crisp and refreshing.  You can easily adjust the strength to your liking by playing with and sampling the cup size, as well as adding more or less ice.  There is a slight sweetness and tang combination that is very pleasing and not over powering in either taste.  Also no bitterness as I have experienced with some teas.  All in all, I would recommend the Lipton K-Cup Iced Tea, Lemonade to anyone who enjoys a cool, crisp and refreshing beverage, particularly the iced tea/lemonade combination!

It's probably been about 25 years since I've had that particular pleasure, so when the opportunity arose to try these 'fancy' graham crackers I took advantage.Nabisco grahams are practically coated in a layer of cinnamon and sugar, leaving a pleasant residue on your fingers. In contrast these Back to Nature crackers have no visible spice on the surface though they do have a smattering of whole grains on the surface, ostensibly to give it that ""old world wholesome"" appearance. Although there's no spice on the surface the scent of apples and cinnamon is pleasant and clean.Oddly, although the smell of apples and cinnamon is quite strong out of the box, the apple cinnamon flavor is comparatively weak. That's not to say the flavor is too weak, only that it's weaker than I thought it would be based on how nice they smell.From a texture perspective these grahams are lighter and airier than Nabisco's offerings. Whereas a Nabisco graham has a bite sort of like the chocolate part of an Oreo cookie, these grahams have a softer and crisper bite more like a Ritz cracker. As such they tend to crumble more easily and, when dunked in milk, they tend to fall apart very quickly.So overall these are a pleasant tasting, light, reasonably wholesome treat that would go great with tea and maybe a little apple jam. I don't know that they'd ever be as much of a childhood favorite as the ol' Nabiscos, but I can see them being a more ""evolved"" graham for more grown-up tastes.

B000FEH8ME,grocery,How and how many calories do almonds have?,"I have been a very healthy organic foods eater for over 12 years.  My mother runs the supplements department of a huge health food store.  I have tasted dozens of health food bars.  Most I wouldn't even consider health food because they are filled with highly-processed extracts of whole foods, such as soy protein (which most people are allergic to).  Even organic food bars are filled with unwholesome ingredients that I would never put into my body.  So I am alway eager to try an organic food bar with an ingredient list short enough to memorize.INGREDIENTSIn a single word - EXCEPTIONAL.  In the market of food bars, this bar is at the top (alongside a few others which I will list below).  Minimal ingredients, all organic, no added sugar, no added thickening agents.  Just nuts and fruits, with a little bit of added organic oil.  Great!  5 stars all the way!TASTEWhen it comes to food, taste is often the deciding factor  (when it really should be ingredients because our taste buds will change very quickly once we stop ingesting super sugary or super salty foods).  Unfortunately most people will rank this bar as mediocre in the taste department. Most people eat far too much sugar and salt in their diet, so any natural foods will taste bland and uninteresting.  For me, however, my taste buds enjoyed the balanced flavor of almond, cashew, blueberry, and date in this bar.  I give it 4 stars for flavor.  It is good, but falls just short of delicious.So there you have it.. a healthy alternative to other food bars out there.  A good natural flavor that is not too sweet.  When you just can't take a cooked me with you to work or on the road, this food bar is a good choice.Overall, I give this bar 5 stars.  5 for ingredients, 4 for flavor, and that extra 1/2 point because making great tasting organic food bars with clean ingredients is so darn difficult.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSLike I said, I have much experience in the health food world and I love passing on good information when I have it.  So here are my other recommendations for organic food bars.  I purposefully did not include most of the well-known food bars - they are so filled with processed ingredients, indigestible filler ingredients, and sugar that I would never put them in my body.1) Raw Organic Food Bar.  Yup, that's the actual brand name.  They make great bars with ingredients very similar to this bar.  The difference is Raw Organic Food Bars are more oily and sweet.  These are my personal favorites.  They have many flavors, so try a few to find your favorites.  Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolatey Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Fiber Chocolate Delite, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Cinnamon Raisin, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12)2) Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars.  These bars only contain only 3-5 ingredients per bar and everything is raw.  These bars are good as well - more flavor than the Pure Bar, but too sweet or chocolaty sometimes.Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Spirulina and Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Raspberry and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).3) Greens Plus Organic Food Bars.  This company offer a variety of bars with different ingredients.  Some bars use peanut butter others use cashews.  Some bars use whey protein, others use soy.  So be sure to read the ingredient before you indulge.  This company uses more processed whole food extracts (like the protein powders), but still the company is on the right track.

The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.

B0026ZYZ7Q,grocery,Is it a nice colors the tazo teas?,"To me this tea was fine, nothing special, although perhaps this teabag version is not representative of traditional Puerh tea.  I was interested in trying Puerh because I had recently heard an interview about ""China's Dark Teas"" on The Splendid Table (google-able). I tried both the ginger and cardamom flavors.Traditional puerh comes in cakes or loose leaves, and is supposed to be ""rinsed"" for 10-20 seconds in hot water to remove impurities and start the tea opening.  Then steeped for about 30 seconds per cup (and the leaves can be re-steeped in more cups).  [Find out more about traditional puerh on the TeaSource page for puerh.]In contrast, the instructions on the package of teabags just say to steep for 3-5 minutes.  Does this tea have some sort of pre-processing that eliminates the traditional rinsing, or did they just used boiler plate instructions? -- the box doesn't say.  However, I didn't detect any major difference in the flavor of the rinsing water (15 seconds) and the cup of tea steeped for 3 minutes, so it doesn't seem that this tea needs the traditional pre-steeping.  The color was quite dark, but the flavor was much more mellow than some other plain black tea brewed to the same darkness.Of the two teas, the cardamom flavor was nice, but the ginger flavor was pretty minimal.  Without the spice, the 3-minute steeps would be too weak for my taste, lacking the fragrance and depth of, say, a good English Breakfast tea, but the cardamom rounded out the overall flavor.  So I would recommend getting the cardamom flavor rather than ginger.I steeped a second cup of each flavor after the first, for 2 minutes, and while the second cup of each was weaker, the spice flavor was a bit stronger in proportion, especially the ginger.  So to get relatively more spice flavor, you might need to steep for the full 5 minutes.  The second cup from the same teabag was sufficiently weaker that it doesn't seem like you could get many cups out of it, as described on the TeaSource page for traditional puerh tea.

The flakes are very hard/crisp and very very sweet.  It made me think of eating a really hard frosted flake (with sugar added).  The fruit is freeze dried without any additional sugar so it is tart (but there is still sugar in the fruit, concentrated fructose).  I put soy milk on the cereal and let it sit for a minute and the flakes were still hard.  I tried rinsing some flakes in warm water to take some of the sweetness out, but that left warm, tasteless squishy flakes that were still sweet.If you like Very sweet cereal with a light malted barley taste, you'll like it.  Just remember that it full of sugar and the sugar/fiber ratio is not good.  If you are attracted to it because it says ""Natural"", remember that there are no regulations on the use of the word ""Natural"" in the food industry and the cereal does list any ingredients as organic.

It wasn't especially good, but it wasn't especially bad either.On salads I go oil and vinegar all the way so I am unlikely to ever try this on a salad.  However what I do use a variety of sauces for, is flavoring for other dishes.  In particular I often make a dish that consists mostly of lentils and brown rice which is quite delicious and made more so by adding different sauces to it for each serving.  For that reason I am always looking for new and different flavors to add, since each new sauce makes the dish different than the time before, keeping me from getting bored with it.In addition, I love spicy foods.  I don't think of Jalapeno as being especially hot - the only hot Jalapeno peppers I've ever had were the ones I grew and ate fresh-picked.  Nevertheless, I thought a sauce with even a slight kick to it would be great with my lentils.  I was a little disappointed to find that there is not even a slight kick to this sauce.  That said, it wasn't bad either.  It is sort of a creamy, pleasantly flavored sauce that didn't clash with any of the other flavors it was paired with. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1214, 1228)"

Those too are coated with peanut butter and have big peanuts on top. These bars are very similar to those and to be honest, I really couldn't find a difference between the two. One pro I did find was that the peanut butter coating did not start melting while eating. I did not find myself needing to get a napkin to wipe sticky fingers.While these bars are filling, it's also due to high calories and fat.

Yogi recommends 4-6 minutes). After seeping, looking at the 2 cups of tea, the Yogi tea is darker -you can tell that there is some black tea included. Both teas are aromatic - the Mint Medley has a nice soft mint smell. Yogi smells like mint, however, it has a more complex smell - there's a hint of cinnamon and it smells a bit sweeter than the Mint Medley. Taste-wise, both teas have a nice mint flavor, however, I found the Yogi tea just had more depth to it: as a tea drinker I can taste that there's black tea included in the blend.

B002IEVJRY,grocery,Why is this coffee too dark?,"I received both the Caffe and Cappuccino versions and did a side-by-side taste comparison to see which of the two I might prefer over the other.First I tried the Caffe version and was surprised to discover it was just black coffee. I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice.

It didn't work because there is no indication how big a squeeze to give.  I was expecting something like is found on Act mouthwash.  One squeeze could be a couple of drops or most of the bottle.  There is also no way to see how much is left in the bottle because of the opaque wrapper.3) Questionable benefits - The label says this stuff adds vitamins C, B3, B5, B6 and B12, caffeine, taurine and electrolytes.  It gives odd measures of each benefit - sometimes as a % (presumably of RDA) and sometimes as mg.  For electrolytes it says it has two lightningbolts worth.

B000FEH8ME,grocery,How many calorie have this yogurt?,"I decided to try the Wild Blueberry Pure Organic Raw Fruit & Nut Bar after trying the Cherry Cashew version and liking it but finding the ""cherry"" flavor to be very subtle.  In addition to being Certified Organic, this bar is gluten-free and vegan. Furthermore, the Wild Blueberry flavor contains a full serving of fruit, is a good source of fiber (3 grams), and provides Omega-3s as well. There is also a decent amount of protein (6 grams, slightly less than the Cherry Cashew bar), and although the amount of sugar is higher than I would've liked (19 grams, or almost 4 teaspoons), the bar is naturally sweetened using agave nectar only, with no other added sugars added.The bar was thick and dense in appearance, with an almost slightly sticky feel. The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.  Rather, as other reviewers have suggested, the taste is more reminiscent of Fig Newtons, most likely because the first ingredient is actually dates (blueberries were significantly further down the list).  The bar also did have a nutty flavor, and in fact it contains cashews, walnuts, and almonds.  Overall, I liked the taste (I like dates!), but I thought the ""Wild Blueberry"" label was deceiving, and I definitely have had other bars that I prefer.In the end, I liked the Cherry Cashew Pure Bar a bit more than this one, and I would rate the nutritional profile of that flavor as slightly better as well.

B004LA1LKI,grocery,How much fiber do you have?,"I like cheese and crackers, though for home use, I would normally buy them separately. Still, this is not bad as a snack food for when you're not home. Because they are individually wrapped, you could easily toss one into the lunch box. Inside, you'll find two tasty crackers and reasonably good cheese.Judging by the nutrional statement, this product is aimed at someone who cares about fat, calories, sodium, and cholesterol. You would not want to eat a package of them, but one is reasonable as a snack. I judge the nutrition as approaching reasonably healthy crackers (like ak-nak) and fresh cheese, and less chemicals than I expected for packaged food.CRACKERRitz has their name from crackers, but these aren't your father's Ritz crackers. They are made with whole grains, and probably less fat than regular Ritz crackers. They have 8g whole grain per packet. ak-nak (a popular low-fat, organically grown whole wheat cracker) is about 11g whole grain for two crackers. The daily recommended amount is 48g, so this does contribute meaningfully.The cracker by itself tastes good, has a nice crunch, and if it was available without the cheese, is good enough for me to consider getting as a cracker for a party.CHEESEI was suspicious about cheese for this product that is made to go without refrigeration. Well, it tastes like cheese, because that seems to be mostly what is in it. The filling is made with semisoft cheese, two kinds of cheddar (well, cheddar is listed twice), and some asiago. It does not have the smooth texture of conventional cheese, but it does taste good.NUTRITIONThe packet of two crackers with cheese weighs 1 ounce, and has 130 calories per packet, 7g fat (11% of daily value), 210 mg salt (11%), Cholesterol &lt;5mg (1%). As a comparison, 1 ounce of potato chips we have show 140 calories, 8g fat, 400 mg salt, so the crackers are somewhat better in all ways except the cheese has cholesterol and the chips do not.The package I received had an expiration date about 4 months out, and this is a new product, so they don't put enough chemicals in them to give them a long shelf life. The listed chemicals are sodium phosphate (probably used as a preservative for the cheese), and tricalcium phosphate (an anti-caking agent, the same chemical that our bones and teeth are made of). I looked both up on the Web and did not see anything bad about their use.Corn syrup is one of the ingredients. There must not be a lot, since this product is not sweet.PACKAGINGWorth mentioning, especially if you intend to buy on the Web and have delivered. It came in a bubble-wrap bag, and the package inside was crushed. However, the individual packets have u-shaped cardboard to protect the crackers from breakage, and only two were broken, and they were broken in half (not into many pieces).OVERALLThese are better than I expected, both in nutrition and in taste. I think they make a fine portable snack. Four stars because I still prefer fresh cheese with my crackers. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2984, 2998)"

It has the ""USDA Organic"" stamp and is certified ""Gluten-Free,"" for those who have gluten allergies, but it does contain nuts, so that's a heads up for those peanut/nut allergies.Although each bar has 190-calories and 8g of fat, I figure most of those numbers come from the added nuts.Anyway, as long as you eat these bars in moderation, I think the PURE WILD BLUEBERRY BARS are a great alternative to other snack bars that are full of processed fruit, chemicals, and added sugar.

I really found the taste hard to get past.2) Dispenser - the product makes a big deal about the one squeeze per 8oz of water (a standard side water bottle).  It didn't work because there is no indication how big a squeeze to give.  I was expecting something like is found on Act mouthwash.  One squeeze could be a couple of drops or most of the bottle.  There is also no way to see how much is left in the bottle because of the opaque wrapper.3) Questionable benefits - The label says this stuff adds vitamins C, B3, B5, B6 and B12, caffeine, taurine and electrolytes.  It gives odd measures of each benefit - sometimes as a % (presumably of RDA) and sometimes as mg.  For electrolytes it says it has two lightningbolts worth.  Most of this stuff you can get easily elsewhere from a normal diet.  Taurine has been proven to be of no established benfit.  Caffeine? Well, I can't really comment on why you would want that in an energy drink.  Many of these ""benefits"" are also not clearly placed in an energy drink or a recovery drink.  I have absolutely no idea how many electrolytes are contained in two lightningbolts.  It is not a measure I am familiar with.Two stars, not one, because it did not make me sick or anything.

No preservatives have been added. The label indicates 80 calories per serving, but defines a serving as 8 ounces. Because the bottle is 11.5 ounces, drinking a full bottle means an intake of 115 calories.Chantea won the Best New Product award in 2011 at the World Tea Trade Show. It also won Buyers' Choice and 2nd place Ready to Drink tea awards at the North American Tea Championship.Of the four available Chantea flavors (original, peach, lemon, passion fruit) I only tried passion fruit. My first reaction was surprise at the amount of pulp it contained. My second and sustained reaction was that the drink was tangy and tart - more than I would have liked. The taste is pleasant but rich and full-bodied - it reminded me of fresh grapefruit juice, but is a little sweeter.Although I may recommend it to friends and try another flavor, I am more inclined to drink acai blueberry vitamin water zero, which I find particularly delicious. However, these Chantea drinks offer a considerable additional benefit related to their aloe vera and green tea ingredients.Aloe vera is a succulent plant originating in Africa but now cultivated worldwide. Egyptian papyri reveal that it was used for healing as early as 16th century B.C.  Sources dating back to 1st century A.D. refer to its use in herbal medicine.Although no scientific evidence yet attests to its medicinal properties, aloe vera is widely associated with helping diabetes and elevated blood lipids, and improving glucose levels. It is most recommended for reducing symptoms of heartburn, irritable bowel syndrome, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and ulcerative colitis. It is an ingredient in yoghurt, and has no known side effects.Green tea, in contrast, has been the focus of dozens of scientific studies, although it has not been reviewed by the FDA. Made from the leaves of camellia senensis, which originated in China but is now cultivated worldwide, it contains antioxidative and anticarcinogenic flavonoids, as well as caffeine.Many studies suggest that:a) Lowers the risk of heart disease, cancer (breast, prostrate, colon), kidney stones, arthritis and dental cavitiesb) Boosts the metabolic rate 4-17%, helping reduce body fatc) Strengthens the immune system, and improves bone densityd) Reduces blood pressure and symptoms of depressione) Helps rescue damaged neurons and prevent brain cells from dying.Note however that the U.S. Pharmacopeia has warned that green tea in quantity does increase the risk of liver damage, especially when taken on an empty stomach. It is also contraindicated for use with the anti-cancer drug bortezomib, and it may reduce the effectiveness of anticoagulants.Those of you wanting a healthy, immune-boosting chilled fruity drink are likely to benefit from this product. However, taste is a very individual preference. If you like tart, full-bodied flavors, you may really enjoy Chantea's passion fruit green tea aloe vera drink. As for myself, I prefer a blander fruit drink. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3376, 3390)"

Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says ""100% natural arabica"". Not sure what the ""natural"" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak ""natural"" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the ""arabica"" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning.

We are always looking for a healthier sweetener for baking purposes that has some nutritional value. Coconut sugar appears to be one of those with some benefits over other sweeteners.Coconut sugar is derived from the flowers of the coconut tree and is an organic, sustainable natural sweetener. This sugar has a low glycemic index and is also a nutrient powerhouse, filled with lots of vitamins, minerals and amino acids. Coconut sugar is minimally processed, unbleached and contains no preservatives.Coconut sugar is made from the sugar blossoms of fresh coconuts found in the tropics. It is harvested by slicing the bud of the coconut tree flower to release the sap or coconut nectar. This nectar is then boiled into a thick caramel and dried into crystals. Nothing is removed during this process. Coconut sugar is similar in texture and taste to brown sugar but far outweighs its nutritional profile.In terms of nutrients, coconut sugar contains the minerals calcium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, phosphorus and boron. It also contains 12 of the B vitamins, including thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, nicotinic acid, biotin, pyridoxal and inositol. Coconut sugar contains 16 out of the 20 amino acids. This sugar is especially high in the amino acids glutamic acid, which makes glutamine, threonine, aspartic acid and serine.We use it in place of brown sugar for baking purposes. It tastes a lot like brown sugar but it is a lot drier. So, when you open the bag and check it out, it doesn't clump together, but is loose like the texture of white sugar. It has a low glycemic index which is another plus. It is not low calorie however. We like this brand and the Amazon price is better than what we can find in the store.

Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.

But the flavor of this one sounded intriguing, so I tried it. It's wonderful! Smooth, deep and dark without being bitter, and the chocolate undertones are deliciously rich. It's an excellent dessert coffee, and also serves quite well as ""dessert"" on its own, for those who decide to skip the actual desserts after dinner.I can't wait to add this coffee to my family's Thanksgiving menu. Update: This coffee got rave reviews after Thanksgiving dinner. Normally my family argues over the coffee... too strong, too weak etc. But today everyone couldn't stop saying ""this coffee is REALLY good!"" Can't recommend it highly enough.

B0014WYXQK,grocery,What sweetness?,"The Clementine (orange) flavor of Izze is my favorite among the three I have tried, the other two being apple and grapefruit. This is a very crisp, refreshing beverage that has just the right balance of fruit to carbonation, and a slight tartness that keeps it from being cloying or flabby. Some reviewers have commented and even complained about this sparkling juice having only the barest amount of carbonation.  Not so with the ones I have tried, so perhaps these other reviewers left the top open and allowed it to go flat or something. Believe me, this had lively carbonation, and a good, natural tasting tart orange flavor.  The size of the can is convenient, too - takes up hardly any space in the fridge or in the lunch sack.As part of the ""Vine"" program, I received and tasted three different flavors but Amazon will not allow me to publish a separate review of each flavor.  So I am combining them all into one.Apple flavor: like biting into a crisp, green apple and savoring the peel and the fruit/meat at the same time. It has nice, clean and refreshing flavors with an excellent balance of carbonation. Normally I am not a fan of apple juice or sparkling cider but this one I liked.  It is not cloying or flabby-tasting as I find most apple beverages to be, probably because this is green and not red apple-flavored.Grapefruit flavor: this was my least favorite of the bunch, but if you prefer a very tart flavor, this fits the bill nicely. Again, a good balance of carbonation, crisp, and refreshing, this had good pink grapefruit taste but I also detected a plastic-tasting element.  The aftertaste was pure grapefruit so I don't know where that plastic came from or where it went, but it did mar an otherwise nice drinking experience.Overall I rate these Izze beverages very high.  They taste good, they are refreshing, and come in convenient-sized cans that easily fit in the fridge or a lunch sack or back pack. Good products! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1945, 1959)"
B005OVPKCI,grocery,How many cereal do you eat monthly?,"I received these cinnamon flavored Quaker Oatmeal Squares from the On The Vine program. I just want to be clear that on the box underneath the wording Oatmeal Squares it states ""with just a hint of Cinnamon"". Dry or with milk this cereal is very tasty.  Cereal w/o milk is 210 calories, 2.5g of fat, .5g sat fat, 9g of sugar, 5g of dietary fiber, and 6g of protein.  It contains 46grams of whole grains, 90% iron and 100% folic acid per serving. As a dry cereal, it is a cinnamon, slightly sweetened crunchy delight. It stays pretty crunchy in milk, depending on how long it takes you to eat your cereal. It has just the right amount of sweetness, for my taste anyway. I don't really care for the sickening sweet cereals. I'm not sure why on the box it states ""hint of cinnamon"", I would say it's more than a hint, it is definitely cinnamon flavored. I, for one, love cinnamon so I loved it. If you are one who drinks the milk from the cereal when you are done, the milk was cinnamon flavored but no granules of sugar left in the bottom of the bowl like you sometimes get with more sugary cereals. I would definitely purchase this cereal on a regular basis and recommend this product. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1185, 1199)"

B004U43ZO0,grocery,How is the taste?,"After receiving these today, I once again gathered the household testers together (aka, the missus and munchkins) to try these cookies.First, let me describe them. (The cookies, not the testers!  :-) )  They are about two inches across, maybe an eight of an inch thick, and are a darker brown than shown on the package.  Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.The taste of the ""outside"" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit ""grainy"", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.  I give these cookies a three star rating ... that is to say they're not good, they're not bad, they're only fair.As an aside, I received these cookies to evaluate as part of the Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon shipping container was very well protected and undamaged, but when I opened the pack of cookies, about a third of them had been reduced to crumbs, and only two thirds of them were in a condition to eat.  (And those were all stuck together.)  I don't know if that was due to rough handling or excessive heat during shipment, so I didn't consider it as part of my rating.  I only mention it as something to watch for in the event that it's a flaw in the cookie itself. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1924, 1938)"
B004K0630M,grocery,Does this drink is delicious?,"I'm normally not a regular drinker of energy drinks but use them on occasion when I need a quick pick me up which amounts to probably less than twice a month. I chose to give the Jamba All Natural Energy Drink a try because it was offered in one of my favorite flavors strawberry banana.  I only had Red Bull, Monster, 5 Hour Energy and ACUTEfruit Energy Drink, 100% Juice to compare it against since these were the only energy drinks that I've ever tried before. Out of the energy drinks that I've tried Jamba Juice closely resembles ACUTEfruit because of the natural flavors, lightly sweetened taste and minimum carbonation. I enjoyed the flavor of the Jamba Juice and quite frankly think it's a great tasting product.  I didn't experience an aftertaste like the 5 Hour Energy, Red Bull and Monster energy drinks that I've tried in the past which is a huge plus.  This is another reason why I tend to stay away from energy drinks because of the unpleasant aftertaste. Jamba Juice Energy Drink actually tasted like strawberry banana. I hate when a product claims to be a particular flavor and then once trying it, it taste slightly like that flavor or nothing like it at all! The amount provided 8.4 FL OZ (248 mL) was just perfect because it wasn't overwhelming and I was able to finish it rather quickly. The times when I do purchase energy drinks, the cans are so large that I normally can't finish the entire can and end up dumping it out but not with this product.The only negative that I've seen so far is that it only provided me with a slight energy boost.  It wasn't one of those products that once drinking it, you feel like you could run a marathon. I could feel the boost but it wore off quickly.  At least I didn't experience a headache or the crash that's commonly associated with energy drinks. I suffer from migraines and it didn't trigger one for me.

B005VOOKMY,grocery,How is the cost of this coffee?,"Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds ""single serve pods"" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said ""teabagging"" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: ""This side down""  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.

B001EO5U3I,grocery,How can I get good bread with a good texture in this hotel?,"SHIPPINGAs was stated by many others, the shipping for this product is too hard on the cans.  Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.COOKINGThe cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.EATINGThese oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were ""nuttier"" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the ""slime"" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.NUTRITIONI found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.REPEAT PURCHASENow that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost.

A brownie doesn't get better than this! The Pure Bars are small but dense and quite satisfying although I could easily eat two at a time. They are moist, chewy, naturally sweet and have no added sodium. The chocolate is rich and not compromised by carob, the fruits are flavorful and sweet, the nuts fresh tasting. All the flavors are bright and nicely balanced without a trace of rancidity or moldiness, a problem I've experienced with other bars, particularly Larabar.The Pure Bar label is easy to read and contains all the nutritional information I like to see. I'm happy too that PURE Bar is certified organic and a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I am definitely going to stock up onPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)on a regular basis because I indulge in them often, not just during hurricane season!

B001LG945O,grocery,What is the perfect balance?,"I really liked this drink.  It's 100% juice with no added sugar, so even though the sugar content is a little high, it has more nutrients than soda will have any day.  Switch tastes like tangy, carbonated orange drink, and that's fine with me!  I didn't notice any aftertaste, and I could feel safe drinking something fizzy (and tasty, unlike sparkling water) without feeling guilty about it.

B003120YHI,grocery,How many calorie have a donuts?,"New Sun Crystals is a new fashionable sweetener with some unusual concepts.  The first thing I noticed was the bright green color of the package with the sunburst of granules.  Light green puts the consumer in the sought-after mind frame of wanting to eat something healthy, light, and natural.  There is a promise that the product will be ""great for cooking, baking, and everyday sweetening.""The directions were slightly challenging. It is a granulated blend of ""naturally sweet stevia & pure cane sugar.""  The directions are to use a half cup in place of one cup of sugar. One pound equals the sweetness of two pounds of sugar. A serving size is  teaspoon, which contains 10 calories; therefore one teaspoon contains 20 calories, the same as a teaspoon of cane sugar. But one teaspoon of Sun Crystals is twice as sweet as a teaspoon of sugar. The math requires a small amount of thought. It's easy to get confused measuring out this blend of sugar and stevia.As the package says, ""Twice as as sweet so you only need half as much.""  That sentence means that you need only half as much sugar as you normally do. (I think!?)Cooking?  Baking?  I turned the package over to discover an enticing recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies. One cookie, which is 1/36 of the batch, has 120 calories. There is nobody at my house who needs to eat cookies, but I thought I'd try the recipe.In the meantime, we opened it. Before making the cookies, I thought we could use some of it for everyday sweetening before making the cookies.  I stirred some into iced tea. Just like any teaspoon of cane sugar, it required extensive stirring to dissolve, and I found that I needed twice as much as half.Next I tried it in hot tea. In hot or cold tea, it tastes wonderful. It dissolves efficiently in hot tea. Soon I found myself drinking so much tea that I was consuming twice as much sugar as usual.  I love the taste of Sun Crystals!So did the other taste tester who shares tea in our office.  He drank cup after cup of delicious hot tea. Although the package says the product is suitable for diabetics, I doubted that it would help someone consume less sugar because the taste is addictive.When I decided to make the cookies, I discovered the bag was empty. I like this product, not because it helped me save calories - I don't think it did.  I know that it had many more calories than the no-calorie stevia which I normally use. I have been trying for months to acquire a taste for stevia, but no such exercise is necessary to enjoy the taste of the Sun Crystals.Also I like the self-sealing convenient package.  The product was, as my fellow taste-tester says, ""a pretty good thing."" ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2662, 2676)"

I think most people will use this as a taco sauce (and I have to tell you, I'm not a Taco Bell restaurant fan, blehhh), but when it arrived I happened to be slicing up tomatoes for a salad, so I just plunked some on and used it as a dressing--and I loved it. Has a very different flavor and the next night I found myself craving it again. So, all week it's been tomatoes, cukes and jalapeno sauce. Not bad.My one complaint about *all* dressings like this is that the jar is too small. C'mon, it can't cost more than a few pennies to make this stuff--all the cost comes from packaging and shipping--so why not make it at least 12-ounces or even more.

Excellent, but a very small portion.The sheffa snack was delicious, crunchy, mildly salty and had a unique flavor. Not like ""Everything else"" in snack foods.The trail mix was delicious, though a little overly sweet for my taste.The crisp multi-seed crackers were better than any wheat cracker I've ever tried. They have a great flavor, a wonderful snap and dip easily without breaking. Not to mention they were sturdy enough to hold up when stacked high with appetizers.Here were my only disappointments:The hummus was VERY lemony and had a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Not as good as store-bought brands like Trive and Athenos.The packaging is excessive - but that's to be expected. I threw away TONS of paper and plastic from an amount of food that barely filled two paper plates.The meat chunks with the meat/cheese and cracker box were VERY dry and hard to chew - much like chunk jerky. That may not bother some people, but I didn't care for it. The cracker was great and the creamy cheese spread was unexpectedly well seasoned and flavorful. They were long gone on the way to my stomach while I was still working on the little meat chunk.The Emergen-C drink mix was very low calorie, only lightly sweet and very pleasant.

The water turns a brillant purplish maroon color very pretty.I usually drink my tea with sugar, but I started this one off with no sugar just to see what the original flavor would be. It is slightly sweet and instantly I get the taste of blackberry the vanilla is more subtle but when I smell the tea I can smell both the blackberry and vanilla. Even though there doesn't seem to be a lot of tea in the pyramid, you really can't tell when drinking it has a lot of flavor in my opinion. I don't really need to put any sugar in it to enhance it. But I did add sugar as well and it really does bring out the flavor more and taste good that way as well. But this is one of those teas I can drink with or without sugar. Regular lipton tea I have to drink with sugar.This tea can be drank hot or cold. I am only drinking it hot but I think cold would be excellent as well. You just brew it like you are having hot tea and then chill or add ice.The ingredients shows there is also hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin.Overall I am very pleased with the taste.

There's not much nutrition here, but at least the treat doesn't cost you too much in the way of saturated fat (only 2.5 g per package), and only 25 of the calories come from fat.The fudge-drizzled caramel popcorn packs are a good fit for the SnackWell's line (which seems to have disappeared over the years--does this product mark some sort of a renaissance for the brand?).

A friend had commented (not here) that it had a ""kind of weird, slightly metallic taste"" but individual tastes differ, that's for sure. This friend had also thought thatVitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch Energy Drinkwas ""really good"" while I wasn't exactly enthralled with it as can be seen in my review, so it just goes to show that tastes can vary, and widely so.And as far as taste goes, the back of the avitae water container says it all: ""What does purified water with natural caffeine taste like? Like nothing."" And that's the most accurate beverage description that I've seen in a long time.  So what's to like about it? Plenty of zeros, as you can see here:- Calories: 0- Total Fat: 0g; 0%- Cholesterol: 0g; 0%- Sodium: 0g; 0%- Total Carbohydrates: 0g; 0%- Protein: 0g; 0%- Vitamins and minerals: 0g; 0%- Caffeine: 90mg; about the same as a medium-brewed cup of coffee.The surprise here was that it looks and tastes just like it was described: water.  There's no carbonation, no sugar, no calories, no artificial sweeteners, and no additives... and that's why I find so appealing. So is there a downside? Yes, it's that this isn't the most cost-effective way to buy water and/or any caffeinated beverage, but it's no worse than most of the others here.For me the 90mg caffeine is just right for a quick pick-me-up, but for those who want half the kick, there'savitae 45 Mg Caffeinated Water, the 'low-octane' version with about as much caffeine as a diet soda... but again: no carbonation, no sugar, no calories, no artificial sweeteners, and no additives.To summarize this, there are plenty of ways that you can get your caffeine boost listed here if you take a moment to search for them. I've been a bit harsh on some of them, but this one is a winner, and if you want just that pure clean taste of water but with a little jolt, avitae's caffeinated water is hard to beat.6/27/2012 ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2009, 2023)"

Preparation isn't any easier than HH (but really, how hard is it to fix something like this?!  If you've got a problem fixing it, you may just want to step away from the stove and go to a restaurant!).  The price still isn't really cheaper.  But it tastes MUCH better than any Chicken Helper that I've ever had before.The real strength of the Velveeta Skillet dishes is the cheese.  The Helper boxes use powdered cheese and a milk/water combo to make the cheese.  Velveeta takes advantage of their core product to offer a packet of real, honest to goodness Velveeta cheese.  the result is a much richer, cheesier meal that is really light-years ahead of powder.  Compare Velveeta shells and cheese to any powder-cheese and you'll see what I mean.Preparation is quick, which comes in handy when you're trying to fix something good and quick.  My picky eater didn't like it, though to be honest she barely tried it; in fact, she decided she didn't like it when I told her it was broccoli and cheese.  My son loves broccoli, though, and he cleaned his plate in no time.  Don't tell your kids it's got broccoli in it and they'll be fine -- the broccoli is VERY finely chopped (this is one place that I was disappointed with the Velveeta, to be honest).

Then you must use the smallest size water shot from your machine.  The oatmeal instructions specify 6 oz.

B001FA1SSM,grocery,How is the stuff?,"I like a pretty wide variety of cereals, and I'm a proud member of the ""cereal is good for any meal or snack at any time of day"" club.  Having tried this new product, I'll be adding it to my (admittedly lengthy) cereal shopping list.The taste is fairly sweet, but not overly so.  When looking at the amount of sugar in a serving, bear in mind that the natural sugar here is not the same crap as the processed white sugar and corn syrup found in less healthy foods.  The flakes and dried fruit are distinct, and don't mix together in a single sugary flavor like sweetened kids' cereals often do.  However, at least in the box I got, the fruit was a little sparse.  If I were designing the ideal mix, I'd probably increase the ratio of fruit pieces to flakes.The glazed flakes are very thick and very crunchy.  In fact, I get to the bottom of the bowl before they start to get soggy at all.  This distinguishes this cereal from other, similar products with thinner flakes.  Those who have trouble chewing and prefer a soft cereal probably won't like it.  The slightly powdery dried fruit is closer to what you find in other cereals of this nature.The rather substantial flakes make this cereal pretty filling, more so than you might think from looking at it (it lies somewhere between other flake & fruit types and granola), but the box is still pretty small.  Those who, like me, generally eat a large bowlful will go through a box in about three servings tops.  At the time I'm writing this, the product is ""currently unavailable,"" so I don't know what the price will be when it returns to Amazon.  So bear in mind that this 6-box pack will probably give you about 18 bowls of cereal when considering the cost. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1711, 1725)"

I only had Red Bull, Monster, 5 Hour Energy and ACUTEfruit Energy Drink, 100% Juice to compare it against since these were the only energy drinks that I've ever tried before. Out of the energy drinks that I've tried Jamba Juice closely resembles ACUTEfruit because of the natural flavors, lightly sweetened taste and minimum carbonation. I enjoyed the flavor of the Jamba Juice and quite frankly think it's a great tasting product.  I didn't experience an aftertaste like the 5 Hour Energy, Red Bull and Monster energy drinks that I've tried in the past which is a huge plus.  This is another reason why I tend to stay away from energy drinks because of the unpleasant aftertaste. Jamba Juice Energy Drink actually tasted like strawberry banana. I hate when a product claims to be a particular flavor and then once trying it, it taste slightly like that flavor or nothing like it at all! The amount provided 8.4 FL OZ (248 mL) was just perfect because it wasn't overwhelming and I was able to finish it rather quickly. The times when I do purchase energy drinks, the cans are so large that I normally can't finish the entire can and end up dumping it out but not with this product.The only negative that I've seen so far is that it only provided me with a slight energy boost.  It wasn't one of those products that once drinking it, you feel like you could run a marathon. I could feel the boost but it wore off quickly.  At least I didn't experience a headache or the crash that's commonly associated with energy drinks. I suffer from migraines and it didn't trigger one for me.

Please take that into account, as your preferences may differ.  As with any coffee one is not familiar with, it takes some experimentation to figure out how to make it ""just right.""  That's my experience anyhow.  So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.  While I would have preferred a stronger vanilla flavor, I wasn't able to get it out of this product before I finished the package.  Perhaps some more experimenting is in order, but, for now I will stick with another brand that I already enjoy. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1713, 1727)"

I recommend steeping a mug of this tea at nearly boiling temperature for about 4 minutes. But being pu'erh, you can leave it in longer and it just gets stronger but not more astringent.

Ingredients are fairly simple:  organic pear, organic broccoli, organic spinach, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), and organic lemon juice concentrate.  When I tried it, I have to admit that it's not bad.  The puree tastes like pear and broccoli - it's a little sweet, but not overly so.  The texture is like Mott's Applesauce (or any other applesauce without chunks).  I didn't like it enough to finish a pouch, but my preschoolers LOVED the stuff.

B004LA1LKI,grocery,How is the pack?,"The snack basically consists of 2 high fiber crackers with processed cheese spread between them.

I know you can't expect real cheese in a prepackaged, non-refrigerated snack like this one, but there's decent artificial cheese flavor and bad artificial cheese flavor, and this is definitely the latter.  (Also, the box reads ""Natural Flavors with Other Natural Flavors"", which is a pet peeve of mine - it sounds silly.  Just say ""Natural Flavors"" already!  It's like saying ""Rainy with a chance of showers"" in the weather report.)In terms of nutritional information, there's 7 grams of fat per serving, which is high, but 4.5 of those are unsaturated fats, which is more acceptable but still high. On the plus side, 5 grams of fiber per serving is great.The main draw of this product is the convenience of the packaging. Let's be honest: for the same amount of money, you can buy a box of crackers and some REAL cheddar cheese and have a much more natural, less processed, better tasting end result - but you'd have to keep the cheese refrigerated and put the snack together yourself, whereas you can just throw a couple of these pre-made and wrapped packages in your backpack and have a quick snack handy in case your toddler runs out of fuel when you're out and about. For a kid's snack, it's sure to be a hit, because it's convenient and not too unhealthy. I'd even consider buying it again for my 3 year old. But for adults, I'd have to think there are tastier and healthier ways to get cheese-on-a-cracker than this.Additional note: my wife adds that she actually liked the taste of the cheese. In her opinion, if you like the cheese that's in the other Ritz cheese-and-crackers products, it tastes exactly the same and you won't be disappointed.

This is not a bad thing, it's just an observation and I admit to being surprised at how substantial the flakes were. The dehydrated strawberries and raspberries added a nice fruity kick to the overall experience.I also appreciate that there are no trans fats in this product as well, something that can sadly still be found in a number of ""healthy"" cereals currently on the market.I never add additional sugar to my cereals, they're usually too sweet as it is, but this one has a 'just right' sweetness to it, a hint really, which makes it very enjoyable without sending my blood sugar through the roof.

There are SIX different kinds of sugar in this cereal plus the concentrated sugar you get in dried fruits.  The flakes are as sweet if not sweeter than many popular kid cereals.  The ingredients list barley syrup, concentrated grape juice, molasses, honey, evaporated cane juice and brown sugar.  That's a lot of sugar.  I compared this cereal to other cereals in my pantry.  I converted all of them to the same number of grams per serving so my comparisons would be meaningful.  In nutritional value this cereal was close to Lucky Charms and Leaping Lemurs (an organic version of peanut butter Kix).  The Lucky Charms had more sugar and less fiber.  For a 50g serving of Back To Nature Summer Berry Blend Cereal you get 191 Calories; 1g Fat; 42g of Carbs with 15g of that in Sugar.  You also get 5g of Fiber but it doesn't state whether that fiber is soluble or insoluble.  Finally, there are 5g of Protein and 91g of Sodium.How does the cereal taste?  The flakes are very hard/crisp and very very sweet.  It made me think of eating a really hard frosted flake (with sugar added).  The fruit is freeze dried without any additional sugar so it is tart (but there is still sugar in the fruit, concentrated fructose).  I put soy milk on the cereal and let it sit for a minute and the flakes were still hard.  I tried rinsing some flakes in warm water to take some of the sweetness out, but that left warm, tasteless squishy flakes that were still sweet.If you like Very sweet cereal with a light malted barley taste, you'll like it.  Just remember that it full of sugar and the sugar/fiber ratio is not good.  If you are attracted to it because it says ""Natural"", remember that there are no regulations on the use of the word ""Natural"" in the food industry and the cereal does list any ingredients as organic.

Compare that to a Clif Bar at 240 calories, 10g protein, 5g fiber, 22g sugar and 5g fat, and it's probably a smarter move to go with the Clif Bar.  But the Big Nut bar is no slouch.  It's certainly a viable option when competing with other typical energy bars on the market.So, if you like peanuts, and you want to try a new energy bar, I would definitely recommend giving these a shot.

It's not overly salty, sugary, or greasy. It's not really all that nutritious (mostly refined carbs and salt water, like most noodle bowls). However, it has a little bit of soy protein and fiber, and the noodles have a nice texture, so it feels like you are eating something substantial. After a long day of travel in an unfamiliar city, the broth made with fresh miso can, in the words of Les Stroud, &#34;make you feel human again.&#34;My &#34;cooking&#34; method is:1. If a sink is available, open the fresh-pack noodles and rinse them. I've noticed that fresh-pack noodles have plasticy smell to them if you don't rinse them first. If no sink is available, I do two iterations of step 2.2. Put the noodles in the provided bowl and fill with boiling water. Cover with lid. Let sit for 2-3 min. Break up noodles with chopsticks, then drain water. Repeat if desired until plasticy smell is gone from noodles.3. Add the vegetable pack and the miso paste. Fill with boiling water to a bit over the &#34;fill to here&#34; line. I find that the soup is too salty with only the suggested amount of water.4. Wait about a minute, stir, then wait another 5 minutes or so until the spinach and tofu have fully reconstituted.I have never tried preparing this meal with a microwave (if I had a microwave available, I would be eating something else).

The hibiscus, rose hips and berries makes for a very nice blend and flavorful tea. It also tastes fresher than any packaged tea I can think of, a real surprise from a company which I had actually been avoiding because of the junk in the powdered drink mixes.  I hope this is a sign of things to come, and that it means that Lipton has tuned a new leaf.

This Blackberry Vanilla sounded delicious,, not a flavor combination I had seen before.  I should also mention that my true test for how well I end up really liking a tea's flavor is whether or not I need sweetener.  If I need it then the flavor is most likely too bitter for me.Out of the box, the tea bags have a bit of a dried flowers smell, not very fruity.  However, when it is brewing the fragrance is delicious!  The berries wake up, and the vanilla too.I tried this tea both hot and iced.  As a hot tea, the flavor was alright, but it was like there were too many herbs and not enough berries.  I did end up needing a bit of sweetener, as I felt the flavor was too earthy.  The vanilla was too subtle to detect.It was when I tried this tea iced that I found I really enjoyed it.  The cold seems to suit the berry flavors nicely, I can taste the vanilla, and I didn't need any sweetener at all.I have never cared for Lipton's pyramid tea bag packaging.  There is nothing protecting the tea bags inside of the box, such as a paper liner, and since the pyramid shaped tea bags are too awkward to be individually wrapped, it's just open tea bags sitting together in a paperboard box.  Also, the bags and string are some sort of plastic-like material, so I cannot put them in my compost bin.As an iced tea, I liked the Blackberry Vanilla.

It's probably been about 25 years since I've had that particular pleasure, so when the opportunity arose to try these 'fancy' graham crackers I took advantage.Nabisco grahams are practically coated in a layer of cinnamon and sugar, leaving a pleasant residue on your fingers. In contrast these Back to Nature crackers have no visible spice on the surface though they do have a smattering of whole grains on the surface, ostensibly to give it that ""old world wholesome"" appearance. Although there's no spice on the surface the scent of apples and cinnamon is pleasant and clean.Oddly, although the smell of apples and cinnamon is quite strong out of the box, the apple cinnamon flavor is comparatively weak. That's not to say the flavor is too weak, only that it's weaker than I thought it would be based on how nice they smell.From a texture perspective these grahams are lighter and airier than Nabisco's offerings. Whereas a Nabisco graham has a bite sort of like the chocolate part of an Oreo cookie, these grahams have a softer and crisper bite more like a Ritz cracker. As such they tend to crumble more easily and, when dunked in milk, they tend to fall apart very quickly.So overall these are a pleasant tasting, light, reasonably wholesome treat that would go great with tea and maybe a little apple jam. I don't know that they'd ever be as much of a childhood favorite as the ol' Nabiscos, but I can see them being a more ""evolved"" graham for more grown-up tastes.

It tasted good enough that I soon experimented with commercial cold coffee drinks such as lattes and cappuccinos.The popular brand, however, doesn't do much for me so I began to look around for a more enjoyable substitute and decided to try illy issimo cappuccino, an Italian espresso drink made with low fat milk and cocoa. I loved it! This drink has a rich, deep coffee flavor that is not overbearing but lingers until you reach for the next drink. The taste-rich drink, not particularly healthy, is made of natural Arabica coffee.This drink is made by illy cafe, a company started in Trieste, Italy, the Adriatic port town where coffee first entered Europe. The company was started in 1933 by Francesco Illy, the man who developed the modern espresso machine. The ready-to-drink product is distributed globally through an agreement with Coco Cola. The drink is available in 140 different countries.I enjoyed this drink right out of the can but others get more pleasure by pouring into a glass and adding ice. The drink does come in a narrow, smaller 8.45 ounce can which does not excite me but I guess it's done for style reasons. Overall, an enjoyable drink. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1395, 1409)"

B004K0630M,grocery,Is it fair for the food to taste good?,"I'm not big on the energy drinks and haven't used them a lot but I will use one when I need that extra boost to get through the night shift. This one is pretty good and different. It has a kinda odd flavor, kinda tart, very sweet, with a faint baking soda flavor in there somewhere crossed with very light carbonation. It's supposed to be Strawberry Banana but I couldn't really taste much that I could recognize as strawberry or banana. But other than being a little too sweet it was ok. I can say that I liked the taste of it just a little, at least I didn't hate it or dis-like it as I do most of the energy drinks. I can also say that I like it better than Red Bull. It would have been better if it wasn't so sweet and maybe had some carbonation. As for its effectiveness as a energy boost I'll have to get back to you on that. If it gets me through the night shift then it will be one that I wouldn't mind using again and probably will if I can find it.After using this last night it did help me a lot. I had more energy through the night shift and didn't have that much of a drop when it was running down. The best part was that it gave me the energy boost that I needed without making my jitter around like a frog on a hot sidewalk. It was good enough that it could possibly become habit forming since I could really use another shot of it today to help get over the slight hangover feeling that I had this morning. But fortunately for me they are expensive enough that I cant indulge myself and end up using them on a daily basis. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1539, 1553)"
B005HG9ERW,grocery,How did you  taste the food?,"The Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water has a noticeably distinct taste compared to the regular bottled ones you buy in the store. And I say this from a bottled-water drinker perspective. Water in my part of the country is specially hard, even when applying consumer filtration. That is why we have regular drinking water delivery. But after trying Essentia, I have a brand new perspective of what drinking water should be. Nothing beats water that has been industrially treated with the right minerals and ph balance. Unlike other consumer grade bottled drinking water, the Essentia undergoes the usual filtration: reverse osmosis, UV, etc. but what makes this a truly long lasting hydrating liquid is that it is infused with electrolytes and life essential minerals that you cannot get with consumer-grade bottled water. Essentia hydrates better making drinking water fun and far in between. Very highly recommended!! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(915, 929)"

B004JRMG98,grocery,How are the jars?,"My first thought was that the Taco Bell sauce would be good as a dip. Since my garden is now producing cucumbers at a scary rate, I tried the sauce as a cucumber salad dressing as soon as I opened the bottle. It worked very well. The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green. They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna. This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce. Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise. The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce. I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well. That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste. The one negative is that they contain artificial coloring and flavoring. They lose a star on that account.

Did he make me feel paranoid? YES!  The next day I chose this popping corn because of my new found cancer fear (Thanks Dr. Oz!).There were barely any dead kernels left each and every time we popped the corn.  We tried with oil, butter and finally coconut oil.  Coconut oil was by far the winner.  The kernels were fluffy, white and large each and every time.  If you are searching for an American produced product, Kosher-certified and whole grain then this will be the brand for you.  If you are into saving money and prefer a larger quantity because your family consumes popcorn almost daily then this is not the product for you!  It is just too expensive compared to the other brands available at your local supermarket coupled with promotional coupons.At the end, it pops prettier but it tastes the same.  Personally I do not have a popper and would have to prepare this on the stove top.  It was a H.A.S.S.L.E. each and every time... It just takes too much effort when you want to snack right at that moment.  If you have an air popper or brown paper bags, you can microwave just the way you would with the microwaveable bags.

They are a Nestle product, made in the U.S.A., and promise 80 mg of natural caffeine per can, and only 90 calories.  The ingredients are given as fruit juices, natural flavors, and natural sweetener.  More specifically, the ingredients for the strawberry/banana drink, which I tried, are given as 70 % fruit juices.  The ingredients  consist of apple juice, lemon juice, water, apple puree, strawberry puree, banana puree, natural flavor, caffeine, green tea extract, and extract of Stevia (a natural sweetener).  The makers state they have added carbonation, but that there are no artificial colors, artificial flavors, taurine or glucuronolactone.It is, of course, a carbonated drink, and therefore rather thin, resembling a soda more than a thick strawberry/banana slurpee type drink, which I must admit is what I really wanted.  Never mind, the makers state this drink has lower calories and sugar per serving than the competition, Red Bull.  I've never tried Red Bull, nor any energy drinks before, so I can't speak to this claim. But I did find the taste quite pleasant --that touch of lemon prevents it's going overboard on the sweet side-- fresh, and refreshing.

At any rate, the good folks in Iowa who work tirelessly to put corn and pork on the table, might consider this sauce to be adventuresome or ""out there.""  However, folks from the San Francisco Bay area, where practically every block contains a Thai restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, or a Korean restaurant, will find this sauce to be bland or tame.  The most subtle feature of this sauce are the little red specks and green specks that are suspended in the orange creamy stuff.  I urge every person who (by habit, choice, or necessity) uses canned beans as a frequent component of their diet, to try the TACO BELL CHIPOTLE SAUCE on the beans.  Once you do this, you will likely view canned beans in a new light, and a more positive light.

I didn't even know it was possible to make a bar without artificial preservatives, that still has an expiration date that isn't until next year!I am not on a raw food diet, nor am I a vegetarian or vegan, but I can say that with these bars handy to grab in the morning, I will be happy to switch at least ONE meal a day to raw food vegan!  I didn't even know products like these were available.I got one bar free as a sample, and NEVER expected to purchase more.  I am back on Amazon today to buy a whole box of these!By the way, if you don't like TART flavors, you won't like this. The dried cherries (coupled with a lack of refined added sugar) make for a very naturally tart bar.  Personally, I like it that way -- enough with the dull ""beige"" flavoring in many processed foods!  :-)Oh, and one added bonus -- unlike with other bars, I didn't feel hungry an hour later.  People have commented on the bars being too small, but I think they are just right (at least for me).  Actually, all bars like this tend to be small, it's just that some are longer and skinnier, which makes them seem bigger.  I've noticed that the weight is about the same - it's just that Pure's bar is short and thick, and that makes it seem so smaller.UPDATE:I liked these enough to buy a box (also bought the apple cinnamon, which I also like a lot.)

(The cookies, not the testers!  :-) )  They are about two inches across, maybe an eight of an inch thick, and are a darker brown than shown on the package.  Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.The taste of the ""outside"" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit ""grainy"", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.  I give these cookies a three star rating ... that is to say they're not good, they're not bad, they're only fair.As an aside, I received these cookies to evaluate as part of the Amazon Vine program.  The Amazon shipping container was very well protected and undamaged, but when I opened the pack of cookies, about a third of them had been reduced to crumbs, and only two thirds of them were in a condition to eat.  (And those were all stuck together.)  I don't know if that was due to rough handling or excessive heat during shipment, so I didn't consider it as part of my rating.

Almost cloyingly so, actually. Perhaps it's just that my tastes in chocolate have shifted over the years and I prefer more of a bitter taste to counteract the sweet caramel, but I kind of found myself ambivalent over this. It's not so awful that I'd toss the box, but I can say that I'd probably skip the milk chocolate variety of this and go for the SC products that feature dark chocolate. Sweet fiends will absolutely love this with a passion and if you're in the mood for something that'll hit your sweet tooth like Gallagher smashing a watermelon, this is the lower calorie chocolate I'd recommend.Texture-wise, this was a hit. The chocolate was nice and soft, with there being just enough gooey caramel to give it that ""melt in your mouth"" texture without it getting gooshy. It's a good size too.

B005IW4WEA,grocery,Is one better?,"I decided to review this product for the Vine program since I love granola, and I had never tried the KIND Healthy Grains brand before.  The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.  Let's start with the positive things about the granola, since there is much to like.  The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.  If you are looking for a great tasting granola, I would highly recommendBack To Nature Granola Chocolate Delight, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)or Nature's Path Love Crunch.

B003FOA0VW,grocery,Where can I get a delicious thing?,"So, gluten free is becoming the new norm around here.  Many people are indulging in a gluten free lifestyle, some out of necessity and some out of curiosity.  I have friends who do this, and while some of the gluten free products available are palatable, I have found that more often than not they are off putting.  I was excited to see if this `care package' contained any pleasant surprises, but overall it just reaffirmed by previous belief; that gluten free is not for me.Let's take these one at a time.Blueberry Pomegranate Trail Mix Crunch:Flavor-wise, this is pretty good.  There isn't much in the package though, and the clusters are rather large.  They are also very sticky and leave a residue on your fingers.  Like I said, they tasted good (not very strong in the pomegranate flavor, but very nutty and blueberry tasting) but they also had a strong resemblance to `healthy cereal', so keep that in mind before purchasing.Multi-Seed Crackers:Crunchy and satisfying; these crackers taste slightly `healthy' but they also have some interesting flavors that give it a distinct and memorable taste.  I had to get used to them, but after a few bites I was hooked.Steak Nuggets + Cheese:This box contains a little meal.  The beef steak nuggets are a bit like jerky but they have a bland aftertaste.  They are chewy, but predictably so; despite the promise that they are `more tender'.  The Multi-Seed crackers are the same already provided in a larger bag.  When you lather on the Parmesan Peppercorn cheese spread, it takes those crackers to another level.  It's a great flavor, but I will say that it is a tad runny as apposed to creamy.  I'm kind of obsessed with ginger in general, so this Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix is phenomenally good.  I know that seems a tad excessive, but you can't go wrong with banana, cranberries and GINGERED PEANUTS!  Oh, and to finish off the `meal', you have an Almond Roca, which is always delicious.Sheffa Zesty Snack Mix:I was really excited about this.  The mix on the cover of the package looks amazing.  I've had chickpea fries before and I loved them.  Roasted corn and toasted seeds sounded like the perfect way to round out the snack.  Opening the package and peering inside I was turned off completely.  It looked like animal food.  The chickpea noodles are about five times smaller than they appear on the cover.  The taste is also extremely bland and almost too earthy.  It was kind of like chewing on twigs.  I think I've said enough about this one.Popchips, Barbeque Potato:Now these are kind of great.  They have a great airy texture that sits well on the tongue.  The flavor is strong on the outset, but one thing that is a slight detractor is that the flavor does dissipate quickly.  So, yes; the chips aren't perfect, but they are uniquely inviting, and that airy consistency really makes for a light and tangy snack.Sharkies, Watermelon Scream:There is an artificial flavor here that I'm not a gigantic fan of.  It kind of tastes like sugar substitute; a cloyingly sweet aftertaste.  That said, there is a lot of flavor here.  It is a robust flavor, so it has that going for it.  If you don't mind that faux-sugar taste then you should really enjoy these.  I could definitely taste the watermelon, which is nice (I love the flavor).Wild Garden Hummus:On its own, this garbanzo bean dip is a tad too; sweet?  I think that's the sensation I'm getting from this.  It just seems off.  It actually has an almost sour tang to it, like something that has gone bad.  But, when lathered onto one of those multi-seed crackers it is actually masked enough by the earthiness of the cracker to give off a pleasantly balanced bean flavor.Emergen-C Raspberry Fizzy Drink Mix:I love the taste of raspberries, but I have to tell you that I have a strong aversion to these types of drinks.  They always taste chalky and artificial to me and this one really isn't an exception to that rule.  It is void of much flavor, but it certainly smacks the back of your throat with that sweetened fizz.In the end, I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't need to cut gluten out of their diet.  It just isn't worth it.  But, if you need to find gluten free alternatives to foods you love, then this may be something you'll enjoy.  The Popchips and the crackers are pretty good, and those gingered peanuts are still calling my name. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4365, 4379)"

B00B9AAI9S,grocery,How was it to taste?,"I've tried a lot of different teas in my day but never a ""savory tea."" When I got this sampler box in the mail I tried them immediately and have some thoughts about them.First, they come off tasting like weak soup in a lot of ways. The flavors are very muted, as one might expect. I discovered that if I boiled the bags in water for 10 minutes rather than steep them as tea in a cup, the flavors are considerably improved and strengthened. Each bag contains either decaf green tea or decaf black tea, but I didn't taste tea flavors in anything I brewed.Dieters might well like how this tea feels a bit more like a foodstuff than tea normally does. At 5 calories per steeped cup of tea, it's a very light snack at best, but with whole-grain crackers and perhaps a bit of cheese, it'd feel like a decent lunch. I can't imagine drinking a cup of this tea by itself and feeling sated. The cup I tried was drunk at midday with no breakfast in my stomach yet, and it definitely didn't curb any hunger pangs. Middle-aged and Boomer dieters familiar with powdered bouillon packets in hot water will find these a considerably upmarket and modernized version of the old Herb-Ox standby. Once you get past the ""weak soup"" feeling, the flavors are light and bright. The Tomato Mint soup in particular functioned well as a drink.These do make wonderful poaching liquids for soups. I just got finished with an egg-noodle soup made with the Spinach Chive tea and thought it was delicious. I boiled the teabag in the water for 10 minutes, then stirred in the noodles to cook. I couldn't taste much of spinach or chives, but the broth was quite good at any rate. It's a pity they have actual tea leaves in them, or I'd have just ripped the bags open to use as seasoning for the food. I loved the complexity of flavor they produced when boiled that way and used as part of a meal. It's an off-label use, but one I recommend wholeheartedly.I can't see myself buying these except for cooking purposes--which may well happen as I did like the broth made from them--but dieters may well find them useful as actual tea to drink. I would recommend that anybody using these boil the bags rather than steep them to get the full flavor from them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2220, 2234)"

B004TPKAN4,grocery,What is the texture of salt?,These are the best ginger snaps I have ever tasted. The ginger taste is intense but not over-powering. I like that they added little pieces of candied ginger to the cookie. It's a nice touch. I appreciate that the ingredients are ones I can actually pronounce. There are no ingredients in this cookie that make me wonder what I am eating. These are all ingredients that one would use baking cookies in their own home. The cookies are approximately 1 and 1/2 inch in size and there are approximately 30 cookies in the 6.5 ounce bag. The bag comes with a resealable tape so you can close the bag up tight to preserve the freshness and snap of these delightful little cookies. The cookies are very crunchy but not break your teeth hard like some ginger snaps can be. They have the perfect density for a ginger snap. I highly recommend these ginger snaps and I myself will be buying more of them. ANSWERNOTFOUND,ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(893, 907)"

B007JFXWRC,grocery,How do you dream?,"I pretty much love all tea, black, white, green, oolong, yerba mate, and herbal. I normally use bulk organic ingredients that I buy a pound at a time on Amazon to make tea, but sometimes a teabag is more convenient, and I do appreciate the design of pyramid tea bags like Lipton is using here, so I thought I'd give this Blackberry Vanilla tea a try.These are the ingredients:Hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithinI had to laugh when I read these ingredients because the tea I normally make myself, two quarts at a time, starts with one cup of hibiscus and one half cup of rosehips. Since these ingredients are the main ones also in this Lipton tea, I figured it had to be very similar in taste (although I don't add ""natural flavor"" to mine, so I thought maybe Lipton will have some amazing flavor that mine doesn't thanks to their access to food flavoring labs and ingredients I don't have.)I brewed a cup of this tea and my mug was a little on the large side so I used two bags and let it steep until it was somewhere between still hot and just lukewarm. The bags smell pretty good in the box, but even with two bags this tea was pretty weak and I thought it lacked flavor. I really wanted to like it but I think I will definitely stick with the hassle of making my own - for more flavor, for organic ingredients and for economics. I would suggest not using more than six ounces of water per one of these teabags. The tiniest bit of sugar or honey may help bring out the flavor in this tea if you do happen to have a box of it.

I always think it is a little fishy when a company uses many different sweeteners, presumably so the sugars can be lower in the ingredient list. This cereal contains wheat, if that is an issue for you. I found the cereal plenty sweet without adding any other sweeteners. It is rather high carbohydrate of 46g (5 g fiber) in a 1 cup 55g serving. There are 210 calories, 17 grams of sugar, and 5 grams of protein. I usually don't add fresh fruit to cereal so I find it convenient for it to be in the cereal.

Reading the label on the Viva Labs container I learned it can be used for skin and hair care too.Viva Labs Coconut Oil is certified USDA Organic, CCOF Certified Organic and is a NON GMO Project Verified. Besides all the health, cooking and skin and hair care benefits, the certifications caught my attention too. I know that USDA Organic is a seal I look for and respect because the process to be able to be USDA Organic is extensive and I usually choose products with this seal for my family.I did not know about the other certifications so I had to look them up. CCOF Certified Organic stands for California Certified Organic Farmers and was the first organic certification entity in the U.S. The NON GMO Project Verified seal means that there are no genetically modified organisms used in the product. I did more research on NON GMO, because I was curious and found their website very helpful and interesting.Trying Coconut Oil out in the kitchen, I found that we will have to get used to the taste of it for saut&eacute;ed vegetables; it's not a bad taste, just different. As a family we have made other healthy changes that we had to get adjusted to and I think it will be just a matter of time and we will prefer coconut oil to all other oils.I originally only wanted to only try the Coconut Oil in cooking but I decided to give it a try on my hair too!

It's drinkable, as long as your expectations are very low and you're OK with a drink that is red and sweet and not much more.The packaging is pretty cool, though, and portioning is easy - which is why a product like this exists. Just fill an empty bottle with water, squeeze in a little concentrate, shake, and you've got a cheap energy drink in seconds.If Vitamin Squeeze can produce a drink that tastes like something grown, not manufactured, I'd have this stuff stacked to the ceiling in my pantry.

B0015KAYN2,grocery,How was it to taste?,"I bought a jar of this thing on Aug 16 for seven bucks (and free delivery if over Amazon's minimum for such). It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess.Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well).All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't ""take"" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself.One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's ""pure extra virgin"" -- keep in mind that ""extra virgin"" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes ""virgin"", ""extra virgin"", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is ""extra virgin"" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars ""no cholesterol!"". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being ""extra virgin"".OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here).PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Amazon does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review.PPS. Thanks to commenters Lulu and Adriana for additional info and helpful suggestions.PPPS. Trader Joe's sells CO for 5.99 for 16-oz jar. It's slightly more bland than this one, but plenty good but if you use it for cooking or skin. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5090, 5104)"

It's supposed to be Strawberry Banana but I couldn't really taste much that I could recognize as strawberry or banana. But other than being a little too sweet it was ok. I can say that I liked the taste of it just a little, at least I didn't hate it or dis-like it as I do most of the energy drinks. I can also say that I like it better than Red Bull.

If it gets me through the night shift then it will be one that I wouldn't mind using again and probably will if I can find it.After using this last night it did help me a lot. I had more energy through the night shift and didn't have that much of a drop when it was running down. The best part was that it gave me the energy boost that I needed without making my jitter around like a frog on a hot sidewalk. It was good enough that it could possibly become habit forming since I could really use another shot of it today to help get over the slight hangover feeling that I had this morning.

The ingredients  consist of apple juice, lemon juice, water, apple puree, strawberry puree, banana puree, natural flavor, caffeine, green tea extract, and extract of Stevia (a natural sweetener).  The makers state they have added carbonation, but that there are no artificial colors, artificial flavors, taurine or glucuronolactone.It is, of course, a carbonated drink, and therefore rather thin, resembling a soda more than a thick strawberry/banana slurpee type drink, which I must admit is what I really wanted.  Never mind, the makers state this drink has lower calories and sugar per serving than the competition, Red Bull.

The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.  Rather, as other reviewers have suggested, the taste is more reminiscent of Fig Newtons, most likely because the first ingredient is actually dates (blueberries were significantly further down the list).

Organic maple syrup is delish, but oops expensive, so I guess I wont be seeing it in any Vegan bars anytime soon.Now if you think I'm a loon because of the Agave thing, go ahead & research it.  That's all I have to say.Anyway, if you are not concerned about agave or not looking for something to keep you from being hungry then this is a pretty tasty tart treat.  Maybe this would be better suited as a dessert bar.  Yes, I think so.  This would make a great dessert bar for me if they got rid of the agave! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1433, 1447)"

I normally use bulk organic ingredients that I buy a pound at a time on Amazon to make tea, but sometimes a teabag is more convenient, and I do appreciate the design of pyramid tea bags like Lipton is using here, so I thought I'd give this Blackberry Vanilla tea a try.These are the ingredients:Hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithinI had to laugh when I read these ingredients because the tea I normally make myself, two quarts at a time, starts with one cup of hibiscus and one half cup of rosehips. Since these ingredients are the main ones also in this Lipton tea, I figured it had to be very similar in taste (although I don't add ""natural flavor"" to mine, so I thought maybe Lipton will have some amazing flavor that mine doesn't thanks to their access to food flavoring labs and ingredients I don't have.)I brewed a cup of this tea and my mug was a little on the large side so I used two bags and let it steep until it was somewhere between still hot and just lukewarm. The bags smell pretty good in the box, but even with two bags this tea was pretty weak and I thought it lacked flavor. I really wanted to like it but I think I will definitely stick with the hassle of making my own - for more flavor, for organic ingredients and for economics. I would suggest not using more than six ounces of water per one of these teabags. The tiniest bit of sugar or honey may help bring out the flavor in this tea if you do happen to have a box of it.

Nothing beats water that has been industrially treated with the right minerals and ph balance. Unlike other consumer grade bottled drinking water, the Essentia undergoes the usual filtration: reverse osmosis, UV, etc. but what makes this a truly long lasting hydrating liquid is that it is infused with electrolytes and life essential minerals that you cannot get with consumer-grade bottled water.

It tasted no different from the Hazelnut coffees I buy, and I didn't get a sense of vanilla from it at all. That aside, the coffee was robust and had a natural taste to it. Measurements for my coffee maker were the same as regular coffee, which is a positive since I often have flavored coffees that require extra coffee to get a deep coffee flavor. I did not rate this coffee 5 star because the flavoring was so deep that it actually flavored my thermal carafe, and that flavor stayed for 5 or 6 more pots of ""regular"" coffee, despite being washed out thoroughly after each use.

B001H3201Q,grocery,What are the perfect blends?,"First off, I would like to say I was incredibly surprised that this item was still available for me to get as I did not check the Vine Newsletter until the day after it came out.  Second, I LOVE chocolate and caramel--especially when combined together!  Third, I thought it would be fun to lampoon a research project for this review.With this knowledge in mind, I decided to take my bag of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates out to the Veterans Administration (VA) Hospital were I am a volunteer with the VA's diet and healthy lifestyle program, MOVE! (please go to [...] for information).  I did this for several reasons: 1) I knew that my personal prejudice might result in a skewed review; 2) at 290 pounds, I need to eat a whole bag of chocolates like I need another hole in my head; 3) I truly wanted to share the surprising bounty of getting a bag of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates with others; and, 4) as an experienced researcher, I could not pass up the opportunity to do a little ""research.""  Please let me make if perfectly clear that I fully acknowledge that this is NOT A SCIENTIFIC STUDY, which is why I surreptitiously entitled my review ""A 'Semi-Scientific' Survey....""  This is simply a fun way to share the wealth and get the opinions of others.  In this vein I will explain the ""methodological procedures"" I followed, as if this was a real survey.SAMPLE:  I offered a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to a total of thirty people, seven of whom did not take a piece.  All seven were VA personnel, one of which was allergic to chocolate.  The others stated that they either did not like candy (including chocolate) or, after reading the nutritional label, stated the caramel chocolates were ""way too fattening for me.""  There are four registered nutritionists (several with Masters degrees) in the Nutrition Department at Fort Harrison VA, Montana, where I volunteer.  Besides them and myself, there is a part-time staff worker, a physical therapist (with a Doctorate), a veteran CWT worker, and one other volunteer working with the MOVE! program, all of whom took part.  In addition to these eight individuals, I gave a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to four other VA employees and eleven randomly selected veterans/family members, for a total sample of twenty three people (not including myself--the 24th piece).  Out of this sample five stated that they did not really like chocolate and/or caramel very much (but were willing to sample the piece I offered them).  Three others, like myself, stated that they ""loved chocolate and caramel together.""TECHNIQUES: To collect my ""data,"" I cut each of the 12 pieces in half, and offered this sample piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates to people at the VA, and asked them to tell me what they thought of the candy, recording their comments in my personal shorthand notes.  I then categorized each person into one of four categories that emerged from their comments: 1) liked the candy; 2) liked the candy, but...; 3) did not like the candy, but...; and 4) did not like the candy.  I have not bothered to do any data analysis.RESULTS:  Based upon the above categories, the numbers are as follows:Liked Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates:  17Liked Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates, but...  3Did not like Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates, but...  1Did not like Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates  2A few examples of comments made by those who liked the chocolates were: ""Very, very, very Good.  Delicious.  Smooth and rich.  And the smell is absolutely great!""  ""Loved it!  Really, really good.""  ""I like it!  The taste, the texture are great.""The two who liked the chocolate, but had reservations, commented:""Wonderful!  Very Good...It smells so wonderful.  Delicious, but one serving is half the recommended daily fat intake, and this one piece means I can't have any more fat today, as it is all my diet allows.""  ""They're good; better than their regular candy.  But it is too rich for me.""The one person who did not like the caramel chocolate, but had other thoughts stated: ""OK--especially if you like rich chocolate--but it is loaded with fat and just isn't tasty enough to compensate for all the fat in just one piece, let alone several.""The two who did not like the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates had this to say:""Chocolate and caramel are my two favorite candy flavors, and they smell delicious.  Yet, while they taste creamy, they have a noticeable waxy texture and taste that overrides the initial taste and flavor.  Overall, I am sad to say I don't like them, nor would I ever buy them now that I have tried them.""  ""No. I do not like it.  Way too buttery, fatty, and waxy tasting for me.""CONCLUSIONS:  Overall, approximately 80% of those who chose to try a piece of Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates liked them.  Hence, I have rated this four out of five stars.  It should be noted however, that a number of people did not even try the candy when they saw the fat content.  Of those who really liked the chocolates, only four asked if they could have another piece.  When asked if they would buy them, only six of the seventeen said ""maybe"" or ""yes.""  There was, HOWEVER, one universal response (including those who refused to try a piece) to the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates: ""They Smell Deliciously Wonderful.""For myself, the one ultimately responsible for this review, I found the Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates disappointing.  I have tried to figure this out: why don't I like this brand of one of my favorite candies?  While I cannot say for sure, I think it is because the enticing smell and hopeful taste are lost to all the different types of butter/butter extracts and fats used in the mixture.  That is to say, I think they put too much into the mixture, and, while the smell may be powerful, I cannot taste the caramel chocolate mixture.  To me, then, Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates are simply a very rich and creamy (to the point of being overbearing or waxy) candy that has no distinctive taste.  So, I am glad I passed the pieces out to get other people's opinions, although at this time (April 4, 2009) this item is currently unavailable.  And I had a great time doing my ""research.""

B005IW4WEA,grocery,What does the tea taste like?,"""Ingredients you can see & prounounce...""  Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff ""on-the-go!"" as the package copy boldly exhorts.To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some Equal over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no ""refined sugars"" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for ""sugar,"" like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.  But, likeKashicereals, it's a bit too concentrated and a bit too spendy. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3849, 3863)"

Thus was born...Soda Juice!And I tasted it, and it was Good!  Apple and Blackberry were both rather mild tasting; Clementine and Grapefruit a little stronger and more tart; and Pomegranate had the strongest taste.  I'd say Pomegranate and Grapefruit were my favorites, but I enjoyed all of them.In the cans you have 5 flavor choices:Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), andIzze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24).  The only difference between Izze in the cans and Izze in the bottles, other than the obvious of size and container, is that only Izze in the cans is fortified with vitamins: C, B6, and Niacin, plus the fact that currentlyIzze Sparkling Blueberry Soda (12 ounce)and Izze Sparkling Peach Soda (12 ounce) are only available in bottles.Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used.  Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit have the highest calories, 90, Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 80.  Apple, Blackberry, and Clementine have the highest sodium, 15mg; Grapefruit and Pomegranate the lowest, 10mg.  Apple and Blackberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 21; Clementine, Grapefruit, and Pomegranate the lowest, 20.  Finally Apple has the highest sugars, 21g; Blackberry and Grapefruit are next, 20g; and Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 19g.Note: as other reviewers have already mentioned, all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice.  All contain white grape, apple, and lemon juice.  In addition to their title juices Blackberry contains raspberry; Grapefruit contains orange; and Pomegranate contains clarified pineapple and cranberry juice.Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering:essn Sparkling Blood Orange & Cranberry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),essn Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),essn Sparkling Mango & Passion Fruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),essn Sparkling Meyer Lemon Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), and essn Sparkling Pomegranate & Montmorency Cherry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24).  The difference?  The essn products lack the vitamin fortification, have a higher carbonated water to juice ratio, and have roughly twice the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of the Izze products, probably because they contain the fruit pulp, which the Izze products do not.

B0061IUKDM,grocery,How is the quality?,"I enjoy drinking and brewing tea, though I'm no kind of expert on the beverage.  My cabinet is full of various brands of tea and all kinds of flavors.  It's safe to say I don't shop for Lipton or store brand orange pekoe when I can help it.  Generally I like green tea for days when I'm feeling a little under the weather, or when I'm eating Asian cuisine.  When this came up on Vine, I figured, what the heck?This is a perfectly serviceable green tea blend from Higgins & Burke.  The packaging is fairly pedestrian (no fancy tricorner bags, etc.), but done well enough to keep the tea bags fresh until use.  The main thing is that this isn't quite green tea as the label says.  It's green tea with lemongrass, lemon balm and verbena leaves.  Now, that's not to say it's bad.  It's green tea with a little kick to it, an added set of flavors that blend well.  But if you were expecting simply green tea, it could be a disappointment.  I like it fine in a mug with a little honey, though if I'm in the mood for real quality green tea, I won't have this as my ""go-to"".On the plus side, it makes a great iced tea.  I brewed up a batch with some mint leaves and have been enjoying the treat in this unseasonably warm Spring.  All in all, if you have a green tea you already love, this probably won't change your opinion, but it's a nice blend for those looking for something a little different.  And great if you want a green tea for making iced tea!Happy Drinking! ^_^ Shanshad ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1475, 1489)"

I ""found"" them a few weeks ago and thought why not eh - I was tired of drinking the same old coffee.And what a nice surprise it was. This coffee smells good when its brewing - quick as that brewing experience is in a Keurig coffee maker. The first sip - with half and half and a small teaspoon of sugar sealed the relationship. This is simply said a well balanced cup of coffee. A fully body taste without the bitterness that coffee can often contain. No lingering after taste, a huge plus for me in a coffee.

The process of brewing significantly stripped much of the flavor noted when the bag was opened, but the final product, prepared according to directions, was smooth with a nice flavor.Liking our brew stronger, we made our second sample using more grind than called for in the directions. That time around we all detected a slight bitterness. One person called the aftertaste ""chemically,"" despite Starbucks' assertion of all natural flavorings.The next day, we brewed a third batch in our preferred coffee maker, a french press. The vanilla flavor was more pronounced, but so was the bitterness. None of us finished our individual cups of the french press brewed batch. In Starbucks defense, using a press ignores their directions which specifically say to use a ""machine,"" so we did not weigh this batch heavily in our rating.Overall, we agreed that it is drinkable, but not worth the premium price.

Please take that into account, as your preferences may differ.  As with any coffee one is not familiar with, it takes some experimentation to figure out how to make it ""just right.""  That's my experience anyhow.  So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.

I thought this cheesy skillet with broccoli was so yummy, I went back for a second helping!It takes a few minutes to saut&eacute; the chicken bits to get them nice and brown, and we bought some extra broccoli to increase the veg content. And voila! A tasty meal that my entire family praised, including my finicky older father enjoyed. Even my health-conscious older sister commented the meal was very good, and she is usually a bit snobby about premade food.Cooking time can get a bit irksome if you are in a hurry. You do spend time browning chicken, stirring, and getting the meal ready. To cut back on that you could cut the chicken and bake it in the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes, thus saving you the saut&eacute;ing which sometimes I do not like to do.

I then formed the dough into a log and wrapped it in plastic wrap before popping it into the refrigerator to chill.

I also liked the type of ingredients in the mix, which are some of my favorites: almonds, cashews, raisins, dried apples (that I almost mistook for pineapples) and pistachios.The package is easy to open.

B005IW4WEA,grocery,Is one better?,"I decided to review this product for the Vine program since I love granola, and I had never tried the KIND Healthy Grains brand before.  The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.  Let's start with the positive things about the granola, since there is much to like.  The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.  If you are looking for a great tasting granola, I would highly recommendBack To Nature Granola Chocolate Delight, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)or Nature's Path Love Crunch.

If you're cutting calories, having a snack or dessert that is 130 calories without doing much to fill you up is not helpful. The product also contains 7 grams of fat and 0 grams of fiber (eating food with fiber is important if you're losing weight because it makes you fill fuller and less like snacking again later in the day).  Honestly I wish the chocolates came individually packaged so that I could just have one for 1/3 of the calories instead of having to eat the whole package.Personally I wouldn't buy this product because I'd rather eat a chocolate with less calories (these would usually be significantly smaller) or at least one that has more fiber and thus is more filling (like the Fiber One brownies).

This one seems to cover most of those bases, though I can't say that I would run right out and buy one.  The protein is low for what I need to get out of the 48gram bar and the carbs fair to high, in comparison.  The blueberry comes through wonderfully, but the heaviness of the rice protein muddies it, leaving the overall bar a bit flavorless.  That it is organic is a plus, and I notice that it specifically says on the wrapper ""Certified Organic.""  What concerns me is that it does not say, ""Certified Gluten-free.""  This would be of particular interest to someone with Celiac disease, especially since it does not say it is wheat-free and notes that the bars are made in a facility that processes wheat.All-in-all, if you're not dealing with food allergies, the bar is OK.

B000FEH8ME,grocery,How and how many calories do almonds have?,"I have been a very healthy organic foods eater for over 12 years.  My mother runs the supplements department of a huge health food store.  I have tasted dozens of health food bars.  Most I wouldn't even consider health food because they are filled with highly-processed extracts of whole foods, such as soy protein (which most people are allergic to).  Even organic food bars are filled with unwholesome ingredients that I would never put into my body.  So I am alway eager to try an organic food bar with an ingredient list short enough to memorize.INGREDIENTSIn a single word - EXCEPTIONAL.  In the market of food bars, this bar is at the top (alongside a few others which I will list below).  Minimal ingredients, all organic, no added sugar, no added thickening agents.  Just nuts and fruits, with a little bit of added organic oil.  Great!  5 stars all the way!TASTEWhen it comes to food, taste is often the deciding factor  (when it really should be ingredients because our taste buds will change very quickly once we stop ingesting super sugary or super salty foods).  Unfortunately most people will rank this bar as mediocre in the taste department. Most people eat far too much sugar and salt in their diet, so any natural foods will taste bland and uninteresting.  For me, however, my taste buds enjoyed the balanced flavor of almond, cashew, blueberry, and date in this bar.  I give it 4 stars for flavor.  It is good, but falls just short of delicious.So there you have it.. a healthy alternative to other food bars out there.  A good natural flavor that is not too sweet.  When you just can't take a cooked me with you to work or on the road, this food bar is a good choice.Overall, I give this bar 5 stars.  5 for ingredients, 4 for flavor, and that extra 1/2 point because making great tasting organic food bars with clean ingredients is so darn difficult.OTHER RECOMMENDATIONSLike I said, I have much experience in the health food world and I love passing on good information when I have it.  So here are my other recommendations for organic food bars.  I purposefully did not include most of the well-known food bars - they are so filled with processed ingredients, indigestible filler ingredients, and sugar that I would never put them in my body.1) Raw Organic Food Bar.  Yup, that's the actual brand name.  They make great bars with ingredients very similar to this bar.  The difference is Raw Organic Food Bars are more oily and sweet.  These are my personal favorites.  They have many flavors, so try a few to find your favorites.  Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolate Coconut, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Chocolatey Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Fiber Chocolate Delite, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12), Raw Organic Food Bar, Cinnamon Raisin, 1.76-Ounce Bars(Pack of 12)2) Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars.  These bars only contain only 3-5 ingredients per bar and everything is raw.  These bars are good as well - more flavor than the Pure Bar, but too sweet or chocolaty sometimes.Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Spirulina and Cashew, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Coconut and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12),Raw Revolution Organic Live Food Bars, Raspberry and Chocolate, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12).3) Greens Plus Organic Food Bars.  This company offer a variety of bars with different ingredients.  Some bars use peanut butter others use cashews.  Some bars use whey protein, others use soy.  So be sure to read the ingredient before you indulge.  This company uses more processed whole food extracts (like the protein powders), but still the company is on the right track.

I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green.

I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna. This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce. Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise. The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce. I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions.

The directions are easy and you can substitute different meats for the chicken breast, which--besides 2 1/2 cups of water--is the only thing not included in the box.  I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say ""simmer & stir often"", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.  It is hard to see and it does not have that lovely green look like it does in the picture.  I'd really just call it the Cheesy Chicken Skillet dinner and not even include the broccoli.Flavor was decent, although a little salty if you eat more than a servings-worth.

The liquid portion was overly sweet (and I have a powerful sweet tooth, so it takes a lot to surpass my limit of acceptable sweetness), but that might have been alright if the drink had been smooth.  The vile part of this beverage, though, is that it has chunks of pulp floating throughout it, so you have to strain it through your teeth.  When I was a teenager, I bought a couple of bottles of a soft drink called Orbitz because it looked cool - it was an overly sweet liquid with tiny gummy spheres floating throughout, and after the cool factor wore off, I never bought another bottle.

The salmon spread does taste like salmon, which is great, and the lime and chili complement it well. It's just a tad spicy, so mild that I didn't even notice it until I was well into eating it. I liked the slight kick, and it shouldn't bother people with sensative tongues. The crackers are organic, but you wouldn't know it. They're crunchy and buttery, kind of like Ritz crackers. My favorite item was the fruit and nut mix. They were salty and sweet, and the ginger went so well with the nuts peanuts and cranberries. It had a slight kick, no more than the salmon spread, and this was a great complement. The chocolate was ok. If you've had organic chocolate before, you know what to expect. It wasn't very sweet at 60% cacao, and it wasn't very smooth. Not really my thing, but eh. The only thing I didn't really like was the dried edamame. I generally like edamame, but dried... the first few bites were good. I liked the dry, almost flaky texture. But after a few bites, it tasted a bit weird.This has 16g of fat (25% of your daily value), but only 5g of saturated fat (25% daily value), most of which come from the salmon spread.

The sodium isn't bad at 660mg (28% daily value), and neither are the sugars at 21g. The biggest problem is that there's not a whole lot of nutritional value here. You get 22g protien, which is pretty good, but only 10% of your daily value for iron and vitamin C. Fish has plenty of omega-3s, though, and peanuts and cranberries are full of anti-oxidants, so that's something.The packaging is very nice.

This does have that, but it's not nearly as strong tasting as I was expecting.The description of this compares it heavily to chai tea. It's been a while since I've drank the brewed chai tea, as I typically drink the pre-made Oregon Chai stuff, so I can't really tell you how similar this is to the steeped chai teas. This didn't immediately remind me of chai, but then my more recent memories of it are of the Oregon chai and that's pretty much a different beast than brewed chai. I did like the cardamom in this and it really compliments the base tea well.I have to say that I liked the overall taste of this. It has a distinctive flavor but it doesn't kick me in the teeth like some of the black teas do. I also like that I was able to steep this for a little longer than I normally do and it didn't get instantly bitter and undrinkable.As far as the antioxidant claims, I won't be able to back those up with just one box. That's the type of thing that you notice over a longer period of time, but I will say that my coworker has been drinking this stuff for a while now and swears by the stuff. Part of what she likes about it is that it's gentler on her system than black or green tea, so this might be something nice for people who find that these teas are too harsh for them. Caffeine-wise, it does the trick. It's supposed to have about 60-70 milligrams of caffeine, so approach this with caution if you're sensitive.EDIT:A friend recently gave me some pu'erh tea from a tea shop. I have to deduct star ratings because it was such a different tea experience and made this stuff well, ""swill"" in comparison. My coworker got to try a cup of this stuff and she didn't particularly like how it smelled, although she said the taste was well done enough, although not nearly as good as the ""real"" tea.

B004OQ257C,grocery,How is the aftertaste?,"OK, I consume a lot of Splenda every day.  I eat some in my morning Oatmeal, and I always make it a point to get the Diet Coke with Splenda in it, rather than the aspartame stuff.I have been getting the fiber splenda.  One gram of fiber per packet didn't seem to be much, but it was something to make the sweetener less empty, and it eliminated the gram of dextrose used to stretch the Splenda to make it measure. You occasionally see the tablets of Splenda, but they are rare, and they don't work on oatmeal.So I asked my wife, ""Please surprise me by switching to the Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants some morning over the next week.""  She agreed. On the third morning, I noted an odd taste in my cereal.  Not unpleasant, just odd.I asked her, and she confirmed, that was the first morning she had used the Antioxidant Splenda.So, unlike the fiber splenda, the antioxidant Splenda has a taste.Now, I normally only put sweetener in my coffee if it is nasty tasting.  But I don't have any nasty tasting coffee, so I put the antioxidant Splenda sweetener into regular coffee just to see if I can taste it.I am pretty sure I can taste it, but it is not a blind taste test.  I am going by what I taste in my oatmeal.As I've said, the taste is minor and not unpleasant.  It is hard to detect when I put one packet into 8 ounces of coffee.My opinion is that Splenda is the best artificial sweetener on the market.  The worst tasting is aspartame, then stevia because of the odd licorice overtone. Then saccharine, and that only when a small amount of saccarine is used.  I used to make ice tea with a half gallon of strong tea and one saccharine, and at that ratio, it was not bad.  It took the bitter edge off of the tea.If you can get cyclamates, they go here, and then, at the top, Splenda. Nothing tastes like sugar, especially not corn syrup, but splenda has the most neutral sweet taste of the artificials.  Now that it is available, I try not to use any of the other artificials, and I am not supposed to consume a lot of sugar.So plain splenda would get five stars as an artificial sweetener.  Essentials with fiber would get the same score. Antioxidant gets 4 stars because it has an off taste that is not a bad taste and because it is detectable other than sweetener. I believe that even with this off taste it tastes better than saccharine.  So it loses one star for the detectable taste, but not more.This sweetener comes in a heavy, stiff, hard to tear bag, that could probably survive being kept in a wallet in the rain without damage, and the bag is stiff and strong enough that someone with bad arthritis might not want or be able to use the sweetener in the bag.

It certainly provides zing to a boring chicken breast.  As others have mentioned, it's great with cream cheese and crackers.On the other hand, we found the sauce was too sweet with grilled steak, although it probably would work very well with beef in a stir fry.  We also thought the flavors were overpowering with fish.A tablespoon is one serving that has zero fat, but 40 calories and 10g carbs. (The first ingredient is sugar.) For those with allergy considerations, there is a warning on the label that this is ""Manufactured in a facility that processes peanuts, tree nuts, milk, fish, soy, wheat and eggs.""For a condiment, this sauce is expensive.

The passion fruit flavor is dominant, but if you pay attention you'll notice a little bit of green tea flavor too. It's fine for drinking on its own or with a meal or snack.(While some will surely play up the healthy nature of this drink, given all the great things green tea can do for you and that one can never go wrong with aloe, don't mistake this for a 'health' drink.

The pre-popped kernels are large and fluffy, but they're not crunchy, so if that's the texture you're looking for, you'll have to try another product.

Almost cloyingly so, actually. Perhaps it's just that my tastes in chocolate have shifted over the years and I prefer more of a bitter taste to counteract the sweet caramel, but I kind of found myself ambivalent over this. It's not so awful that I'd toss the box, but I can say that I'd probably skip the milk chocolate variety of this and go for the SC products that feature dark chocolate. Sweet fiends will absolutely love this with a passion and if you're in the mood for something that'll hit your sweet tooth like Gallagher smashing a watermelon, this is the lower calorie chocolate I'd recommend.Texture-wise, this was a hit. The chocolate was nice and soft, with there being just enough gooey caramel to give it that ""melt in your mouth"" texture without it getting gooshy. It's a good size too. It's thin and wide, so it makes you feel like you're eating more chocolate than you actually are.I just wish that I liked this more. It's far too sweet for my tastes.

I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices). The ingredients in order: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (ginger, sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium, phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that.

B001LGGH40,grocery,What amount of minerals and vitamins present in this ?,"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me of nothing that I had every tasted before. I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVD's.

I went with the refrigerator method, which took a total of 5 minutes to prepare the mix and clean up. I threw a stick of room temperature butter into my KitchenAid stand mixer for a couple of minutes, added an egg, and then the mix. I then formed the dough into a log and wrapped it in plastic wrap before popping it into the refrigerator to chill. I let it sit for an hour and then I cut half of the log into 1/2"" slices, which gave me 13 slices, and baked them at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. The cookie edges did not brown, but they felt slightly firm to the touch. I cooled them on a wire rack for 5 minutes and then we enjoyed them. They taste buttery vanilla sweet (but not too sweet) and their texture is perfect, not grainy like most gluten free cookies. My family is not gluten free like myself and they loved these cookies too. I am sure if you gave them to a friend and did not tell them they were gluten free, they wouldn't even notice a difference between these and regular sugar cookies.

I couldn't tell that it was sweet tea. All I could taste was those nasty artificial sweeteners.I tried different amounts and numerous glassed of water thinking that it might be that I put too much or too little in the water. None of it helped. It was so bad that my stomach was rolling after attempting a couple glasses. Now, a different flavor might be more for me.

B0014WYXQK,grocery,What sweetness?,"The Clementine (orange) flavor of Izze is my favorite among the three I have tried, the other two being apple and grapefruit. This is a very crisp, refreshing beverage that has just the right balance of fruit to carbonation, and a slight tartness that keeps it from being cloying or flabby. Some reviewers have commented and even complained about this sparkling juice having only the barest amount of carbonation.  Not so with the ones I have tried, so perhaps these other reviewers left the top open and allowed it to go flat or something. Believe me, this had lively carbonation, and a good, natural tasting tart orange flavor.  The size of the can is convenient, too - takes up hardly any space in the fridge or in the lunch sack.As part of the ""Vine"" program, I received and tasted three different flavors but Amazon will not allow me to publish a separate review of each flavor.  So I am combining them all into one.Apple flavor: like biting into a crisp, green apple and savoring the peel and the fruit/meat at the same time. It has nice, clean and refreshing flavors with an excellent balance of carbonation. Normally I am not a fan of apple juice or sparkling cider but this one I liked.  It is not cloying or flabby-tasting as I find most apple beverages to be, probably because this is green and not red apple-flavored.Grapefruit flavor: this was my least favorite of the bunch, but if you prefer a very tart flavor, this fits the bill nicely. Again, a good balance of carbonation, crisp, and refreshing, this had good pink grapefruit taste but I also detected a plastic-tasting element.  The aftertaste was pure grapefruit so I don't know where that plastic came from or where it went, but it did mar an otherwise nice drinking experience.Overall I rate these Izze beverages very high.

B000ED7M2W,grocery,How is the seed?,"OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4938, 4952)"

All you do is mix 2 tablespoons of the salad dressing mix with 1/3 cup of wine or cider vinegar and 2/3 cup of olive oil or salad oil. I used red wine vinegar and olive oil and the dressing was a big hit with the entire family! Much better than the pre-mixed bottled dressings or the other mixes I've tried, like Good Seasons. I also have used the salad dressing mix as a dry rub for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and the flavor it infused into the meat was delectable. Tonight I am going to go back to the Classic Vinaigrette and use it to marinate pork chops before grilling. I also think the Homemade Dressings mix will work wonderfully as an all-purpose seasoning (like Mrs. Dash). The only minor complaint I have is that the product is pretty high in sodium, due to the abundance of sea salt in it. However, I don't think this will be a problem when used in moderation.

I also get occasional heartburn after certain meals and find that its more basic pH helps alleviate such symptoms without me having to take antacids.Essentia does cost a bit more so I will reserve getting it for when I find it on sale or can get a bulk discount.

That said, these are definitely better quality, and better for you, than other similar options. There are no trans fats or MSG, and each serving has 8 grams of whole grain and 5 grams of fiber.

Same can be said for the rotini, easy to incorporate this into your dinner rotation and know that there's some nutrients in your pasta rather than just carbs.  Another point to note when using these ""Plus"" pastas, the cooking time seems to be consistently longer if you wish to have softer pasta than al dente style.

However, this protein bar really tastes of ""real"" peanut butter, but the taste is not so overpowering, it's as if you are eating pure peanut butter. The combination of peanut butter and the cereal/grain is just perfect and the crunch is not overly crunchy to the point it has become crispy, but yet it is not so soft and smooshy that the texture resembles that of nougat in a candy bar. The texture has a great balance, and between the ""grain"" for the base of the bar and the peanut butter flavour, it combines it to a distinguished but not overly powerful flavour so as to turn the Consumer (no pun intended) off.

The tea itself has a nice flavor - a sweet tart quality that is enjoyable both hot and cold. The vanilla has a nice undertone to the berries and there is an added depth and tartness from the flavor of the hips.One thing I was concerned about were the bags. Upon taking them out of the tea, they had not softened at all and had a tulle type of feel to them. I had tossed the first one in the compost and then noticed on my second cup that the bag just didn't feel biodegradable. I looked at the box and could not find any information about the bags, so I called Lipton using the toll-free number on the box.

Inside the cookie is a thin layer of fudge. The cookies have a bit of a dampish-texture and were all stuck together.The taste of the ""outside"" part of the cookie was slighly similar to soft-baked chocolate chip cookies.  However, the texture was a bit ""grainy"", somewhat like an soft oatmeal cookie.  The fudge layer on the inside was tasty, but was a little overpowered by the rest of the cookie.  It wasn't quite as firm as the layer you'd find in an oreo cookie, and was more like a spread.I love chocolate chip cookies, and I love fudge, so I had high hopes for these.  My wife has similar tastes and also thought they'd be a good cookie to try.  However, the testers and I unanimously agree that they are somewhat mediocre in taste and appearance.  While they aren't terrible by any means, they didn't grab me enough to make me want to go out and get more.  Everyone's taste is different, though, so you may love them.

Still, it's up front about what you're getting.The instructions are simple: Pour contents, add hot water (250 ml), stir, and serve instantly.  Upon first opening the packet, the smell of the mix isn't overly appetizing.  The oddly coloured crumbly mix isn't very appealing either.

However, when it is brewing the fragrance is delicious!  The berries wake up, and the vanilla too.I tried this tea both hot and iced.

The cold seems to suit the berry flavors nicely, I can taste the vanilla, and I didn't need any sweetener at all.I have never cared for Lipton's pyramid tea bag packaging.  There is nothing protecting the tea bags inside of the box, such as a paper liner, and since the pyramid shaped tea bags are too awkward to be individually wrapped, it's just open tea bags sitting together in a paperboard box.

The taste is absolutely perfect.  The food is very sweet like fruit is but not artificially so.  The greens are in the perfect balance.  Not too much to be overbearing, but the pear fruit taste balances it out perfectly. It was gobbled right up!The container is very interesting- it is flat with that screw on top.  The top has a seal on it, and is very easy to remove, but not so much that it will come off if you have to transport it.  Once you open it, the spout is easy to get the food out of, and then if you need to re-cap it, you can do so and keep the rest until the next day.I doubt that this food would last that long, however. It is so delicious that it will be finished most likely.  The packet is also fairly easy to get most of the food out of too, leaving little waste.This food is so good that my entire family right up to Daddy kept trying to eat it all instead!

B003XDH6M6,grocery,How is the texture?,"I was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & I'm always eying up new flavors to try out. This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things ""watermelon"" or ""strawberry"" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention ""organic"" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have ""made with organic ingredients"" on it, just ""made with organic sugar"". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.EDIT:Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion. If you have a cast iron stomach (which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good), then you probably won't have a problem with this.

B004K0630M,grocery,How is the aftertaste?,"If you need an energy fix and you want something sweet and fruity, Jamba Juice is a good bet.  It isn't so high-octane that it induces tachycardia (a problem I've had with a few other energy drinks on the market) but it does provide that little extra boost that will get you through a long day--or night. A can of Jamba juice contains about 25% more caffeine than the average cup of coffee, although its all-natural creds are somewhat off-set by its sugar content. (You can control the amount of sugar you dump into a cup o' joe.) It's best chilled, the banana and strawberry flavors are pronounced but not overpowering(main ingredient, though, is apple juice), and it finishes with a lemony tang.In a glass, Jamba Juice doesn't look especially appealing; it resembles fizzy broth. I guess that's the price you pay when you want to stay away from artificial dyes. It's probably the ""healthiest"" energy drink out there right now. And the taste isn't so memorably great that you want to chase it with another and then another...a strategy that would, probably, result in the above-mentioned tachycardia.The bottom line for me is that I would definitely drink this again if someone offered it, but I wouldn't buy it for myself unless I found it on sale.

B001ELJER4,electronics,How is the feature?,"Big complaint:  Garmin needs to trim the product line and concentrate on selling no more than 5 models at a time. It should discontinue the old models as soon as the new models come out.  And the model numbers are extremely confusing.  A model named 780 may actually be an older model and has fewer features than a 765T.  Many of those models differ by just a couple of features.The first unit I bought had a volume problem.  The sound occasionally went to inaudible levels on its own even when the volume was set to maximum (100%).  Then after a trip it would go back up to normal levels again.  Amazon exchanged that defective unit.The traffic rerouting feature really works.  On a stretch of freeway with highway construction, the routing function intelligently bypassed that section of the freeway using detours.  I love that feature.  I assume the feature is only as good as the accuracy of information relayed to the center that keeps track of traffic information.The lane assist feature has two modes: the photo-realistic mode and the highlighted lanes mode in the upper left corner of the screen.  The photo mode only works at a few major freeway interchanges in major metro areas, while the highlighted lanes mode works at a lot more places.  There is no need to press any button to activate either mode.  The photo-realistic screen just pops up for a few seconds on its own at the right moment.  Then it goes back to normal screen showing the highlighted lanes in the upper right corner of the screen when the critical moment is past.The FM broadcast feature works well. It broadcasts directions over the car radio, but I have to set the radio volume high to get decent volume.One big gripe, the turn announcements sometimes come too late, almost at the last minute.  Most of the long distance turn announcements come in three stages.  Example:  after you just finished a turn, it will immediately say, ""Drive 6 miles then turn right on Broadway"".  The second stage announcement is at either 0.1 miles or 0.2 miles: ""In 0.1 miles turn right on Broadway.""  Sometimes the secondary stage will say: ""In 0.2 miles turn right on Broadway.""  The third and last stage is at about 10 feet before the turn:  ""Turn right on Broadway.""  The problem is that the second stage warning at 0.1 mile before the turn is essentially a last minute announcement that is frequently only useful if you're already in the correct lane because 0.1 mile is about a half block length before the turn.  If you had kept on driving for most of the 6 miles in the wrong lane, you'd likely have forgotten that you should be on the right lane to get ready for the right turn.  Having only 0.1 miles of warning to change lane is sometimes very hard to do in busy city driving.Another major flaw is the unit gets very hot on hot summer days when it's plugged in and placed on the dashboard.  I use the bean bag mount on the dash and the unit gets very hot under the sun even when I am driving with the windows down.  The sun's rays heat it up, along with the fact that the electronics inside heats up on its own when plugged in.  The high temp is very bad for the longevity of the unit.  I may have to either build a sun shield or put white tape on the back of the unit to reflect sun light to keep it cool.  I would not be surprised if the some of the reports of premature malfunction mentioned by other reviewers and of the volume problem I mentioned earlier were due to heat damage.The ""Where Am I"" feature is great, particularly if you're almost out of gas and need the GPS to lead you to the nearest gas station fast.  It also shows the nearest police station and hospital.  It also tells you the nearest intersection and nearest street address, useful if your car breaks down in unfamiliar places and you need to call for emergency service.The MP3 player has about 2GB of free storage space. It can put out the sound in one of three modes:  internal speaker, earphone jack, or over the radio using the FM signal.  I didn't appreciate how nice it was having the MP3 feature until I realized that it's integrated with the GPS function, something that would not be true with your car radio. With GPS units that don't have MP3, one usually can't play music on the radio when the GPS is in operation(at least not loudly) because the radio would drown out the direction announcements from the GPS.  With the built-in MP3 on the 765T, I can play a whole album of MP3 songs while the unit operates in the GPS mode.  The driving directions announcements will override the music, so when it announces directions, the music stops temporarily and will resume once the direction announcements are over.  Very nice!Overall I love this unit.  Is it worth the premium over a 255W or 265T?  That depends on how much you value the lane assist and traffic info features and the MP3 feature.  I don't have Bluetooth devices and so can't comment on it. The lifetime (i.e. for the life of the unit, not of the buyer) Navteq traffic info subscription is worth $50 + the traffic antenna about $35.  So mostly the price difference between the 255/265 and the 765 is for the traffic feature, plus the MP3, bluetooth, lane assist, etc.  Are they worth the $100-$120 price difference?  I would tend to say so. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5262, 5276)"

B002HWRJBM,electronics,How is the button?,"Loved the mouse to start. Very comfortable grip. Wireless reception and use was great. The Darkfield laser is perfect for hard to use surfaces for most mice. I train people for a living, and often find myself in very dusty environments all the way to glass table board room environments. This mouse has worked well on all of them.I have owned 3 of these mice. I liked the first one I bought so much, I bought one for use at work as well. The battery life held up well, even on the road through heavy use.I Bought the first unit for work, when the left mouse button died, at a year, I bought another assuming it was a fluke. When the second mouse's (my home mouse) left button died at a year as well, I scrapped the mice and decided to move to mice that could handle heavy click use. Granted the programs I use involve A LOT of clicking, then add some gaming into the mix and well... the mice just didn't hold up.For the price / performance ratio, I opted to go back to using true gaming mice. Given the beating I give them, they simply hold up better. If you are in an office environment, or a light to medium use scenario, it's a great mouse. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1144, 1158)"
B00BGGDVOO,electronics,Why do I have intuitive control?,"We bought the Roku for the bedroom as part of our cable cutting efforts.  So far we love it.  The menus are simple and easy to use.  Setup was a breeze.  It found the wireless without a problem and we never lose connection or lag or freeze up.  We have had a lttle trouble with Netflix on it, but it seems to be a Netflix thing since all the other channels like Amazon worked fine.  I would love to see more of the primetime channels like ABC and NBC have their own channels, but that is not a device concern.  Got Hulu+ and there's not much TV we will miss at all.  One of the best features for cable cutters is that the Roku Search works accross all your channels.  So you type in the show or movie and it tells you every instance accross all your channels.  Then you pick which one to watch it from.  I even use the iPhone app for Roku to control the device.  It is responsive and it is good to know that if we lose the included remote, we have a backup.  Also, the app allows you to type search items rather than hunt and peck with the arrow buttons of the remote. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1069, 1083)"

First off it's tiny.  You can clip it on your lapel, jacket or put it in your pocket. It is very easy to use. No messing with software or bloated programs.

B0001FTVEK,electronics,What do you think about headphone?,"These headphones work great. They're Sennheisers and you usually can't go wrong with this brand.The headphone reproduces the full range of sounds very clearly and without distortion, if set up properly (I'll get to that).I've been able to walk around my home without experiencing too much distortion. Within the same room as the transmitter, the sound is really clear and robust. It's great not being tethered to one location or having to deal with accidentally yanking the cord out when moving around.Also, unlike my other enclosed-type headphones, the design allow for air to circulate freely. So your ears won't become uncomfortable warm during use. These headphones are very comfortable.As far as specs, you can get a good assessment of the product from reading the Amazon description so I won't go into that.For portable devices with a headphone jack, you simply have to purchase a ""2-RCA (female) to headphone jack (male 3.5mm plug) adapter"". Make sure the adapter is a ""stereo"" adapter versus a ""mono"" adapter. They look exactly the same, so beware. These adapters are pretty inexpensive.I was a little concerned about getting wireless headphones because of all the negative reviews I've read regarding sound quality, interference, etc.Sound quality and hissing can be minimized if you set up properly. Here's a quick ""What to do"":Portable Players (i.e. CD, MP3, Walkman, etc):1) If the device comes with an output other than the headphone jack, use it. This other output (line-out) is usually a jack that delivers a constant, high (i.e. loud) signal. Regardless of your headphone volume level, this jack will output at a constant, strong, loud signal. These line-out jacks are usually found on the back of some CD players.2) If the device only comes with a headphone jack, set the volume to max or near max. This is the setup I'm using. These headphones were bought primarily to be use at work, so I can listen to my iPod wirelessly.NOTE!!! If you're connected to a dedicated home amp/receivers/etc... DO NOT crank the volume all the way up or even remotely close to it. (The line out on your home amp/receiver will transmit a strong, clear signal regardless of the volume setting, if you're connected to the receiver/amp's line-out)The volume should be set high ONLY for smaller, portable devices that output less power such as an MP3 player or handheld portable CD player. You've been warned;-)Why set the signal coming from your unit as high as possible? It significantly reduces the background noise, since the signal being transmitted is strong. You won't need to turn up the volume on your headset as high since the signal being transmitted is strong. Yes, your portable music player will use up power faster, but who cares? Use a power adapter for your device.If your signal wasn't strong, you would need to increase the headset volume which also increases the level of background hiss. Try it out. I would speculate that a lot of these reviews, which complain of unbearable hissing, are a result of their device's volume level being set low.Hope this info helps. Enjoy the headphones... They're pretty nice. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3124, 3138)"

It works.I was at Best Buy the other day and saw a HDMI cable for almost $200. Yep, you read right. $200. That's $100 per meter. That's as much as forty foot longs at Subway, or a 1994 Ford Aspire. My videophile friend tells me that high-priced HDMI cables are better than cheap ones, since it's expensive to make 99.99% deoxygenated wire, which apparently prevents degradation of the signal.Who knew that oxygen degraded a digital signal? Too much oxygen also probably destroys the Higgs bosons in the cheap HDMI cable, which is probably why I cannot view my Blu-rays in the 2160P that my videophile friend's expensive HDMI cable allows. I told him he should buy theDiamond HDMI Digital Audio/Video Cable W/ Ethernet Connection (5M)for a bargain $2694.75 (at the time of this review), but for some reason he hung up on me.I did consider buying the Audioquest Diamond HDMI cable myself since a simple exercise in logic determined that this cable would be approximately 450 times better than the BlueRigger HDMI cable ($5.99), right? So I almost ordered it but then I suddenly realized that the cable was more expensive than my TV by a magnitude of almost 10.  I went for the BlueRigger cable instead.

This isn't really surprising, it's just the nature of integrated graphics in an OS with a lot of visual bells and whistles.* When it's hooked up to a display via HDMI, the Mini outputs in YPbPr rather than the full RGB color space. This causes some weirdness in color reproduction and there's no way in OSX to force it to output in RGB.

For those of you worried that you need a new amp to go with these speakers, the answer is not really. The speakers are still great. I'll eventually upgrade the amp to get a HDMI capable one for the losless/HD sound. But for now these speakers are wonderful.The center speaker is amazing, you really can hear the actors voices clearly over loud music or effects. The rear speakers are very pronounced, you can hear background noise very well and get a better sound stage. For $400 (at the time of this review) you can't beat these speakers. I went into a BOSE store this weekend and all of their speakers sounded just as good as these, except these speakers only cost $400.The only negative I'd say is the subwoofer is to me, huge. Others said it was small, I guess that is relative. While the sattelite speakers are definitely small, the subwoofer is not what I would call small and difficult to place.Also, others said the speakers are difficult to mount to a wall. I don't think so at all. They may have missed that there are several screw options on the back. (I actually bothered to read the instructions).

I decided to invest in a mouse and since I was going with a Mac, I decided I should keep it stylish in case I have clients over - I dropped a hefty amount on a keyboard/mouse setup and was anxious until I hooked the Magic Mouse up.Immediately, I fell in love.  Bluetooth connected seamlessly and the mouse was a dream, even if it didn't have a direct line of sight.  As a matter of fact, I haven't had a single moment of unresponsiveness.The touch controls on the mouse are wonderful.  I normally don't review products, but the ability to swipe between programs and scroll from the mouse is great and practically multiplies productivity.As far as ergonomics go, the mouse is just OK.  It seems like it's just a little too thin, but so far I haven't had any pain, just a little discomfort which I'm going to attribute to a learning curve.The final (fixable) issue is the lack of touch commands supported by Apple.  Because the top half of the mouse is essentially a touch pad, it should be that we can do much more than simply clicking, but this isn't really supported.  Downloading a third party plugin (better touch tool for Mac) solved this problem - I can even launch programs by using a custom hand movement just with my mouse.

B004XZL980,electronics,What is the price of the display?,"UPDATE - 6/27/11 -I did get a software update a while back for the A500, and it did fix the screen waking up, this made it so that the battery will now last for a couple of days of light use before it runs out, compared to being plugged in everyday like it was before when the screen would wake up for notifications.I haven't really noticed any other large changes from the previous version.  On the other hand, I did see that a leaked version of the 3.1 upgrade is out on the web today, so we should be getting that upgrade soon, and it sounds like a lot of enhancements are in that update.One other thing of note, is that I picked up a wireless usb keyboard for use with the A500, and it worked fine for me, but my wife was trying to use it with blogger and she said she was having problems with it.  Seems like it couldn't quite keep up with her typing.  It doesn't seem to be the keyboard but the A500 that was the limiting factor, because I used the keyboard on a normal laptop, and didn't notice any lag.I still really like using the A500 over having to use a normal laptop like I was before, it is just so much nicer that it is always on and I can just hit the power button and go!  Still very happy with this purchase.END UPDATE**********************I bought this the week it showed up in a brick and mortar store near me.  I love having a tablet around, it is much quick to just pick it up and use it instead of having to wake up/start up my computer.  I use this for most of my web browsing now when I am at home, and I also take the tablet to work and use it for music via bluetooth (works perfectly with my sony DR-BT50 headphones).HDMII have also purchased an hdmi cable for the tablet and that works awesome.  When you plug in the hdmi cable, it will automatically start mirroring the display, and the sound worked through the TV speakers as expected.  I have noticed that since the resolution on the A500 is 1280x800 it cuts off part of the top and bottom when it is connected to my tv, which runs it at 720p (1280x720).  This is a minor annoyance because I was able to share videos and other content quickly and easily with the tablet, where as with my laptop, it never seems to work as nice.Sound & DisplayThe sound on the tablet is really good, I was kind of surprised, for such a small thing to have such good sound.  I am not saying I would want to listen to my music over the speakers, my headphones are much better for that, but for sharing music or videos with people around it works pretty well.  The display is fine, good, but not great.  I think the colors and brightness are fine, but my phone seems better (Galaxy S phone).  The viewing angle is good, and easily sharable with a person sitting next to you.Apps & SoftwareI really like Honeycomb (Android 3), the G-mail client is much better.  The browser is fine, but it is a little on the sluggish side.  I planned on using this to replace a laptop for surfing the web while moving around the house, and it is good for that, but I can tell that the browser is just not as fast as the laptop on the same network, so I think it might be a little underpowered by comparison.  Most sites load with the full site and not a mobile site (wired for some reason always gives me the mobile... grrrr), and that makes it a much better experience.  The on-screen keyboard is ok, I am so used to using swype on my phone, that I miss it when using the A500, but I haven't tried to install it yet.  As for the other apps in the android market, I have loaded a bunch of the non-tablet apps, and they seem to work fine for me.  Most of them scale great (including angry birds, which is huge on a 10.1"" screen).  I have also picked up a few tablet only versions, and they worked just as well.HardwareOverall the tablet seems zippy, I haven't noticed any slowdowns when running regularly, though I did get choppy video when trying to use a 720p video on You Tube while connected to HDMI.  I haven't tried that again, but I have a feeling it just was too much for the tablet.  Anyway I love that it has the HDMI port, and the USB micro in for transferring data over, and a normal usb for a keyboard, or flash drives.WIFIThe wifi works just ok, the signal strength doesn't seem as good as a normal laptop, but it is about the same or possibly a little better than my Galaxy S phone.  I have also had times where sitting 10 feet from the router I kept loosing the signal, but after a reboot, it seemed to work fine.  I have also wifi tethered the A500 to my phone, and that worked out great.  Basically you just turn on wifi-tether on the phone, and the A500 saw it as an access point right away.  The only bad part is that it does suck the phone's battery very quickly.  I did this while out camping (sadly only getting E :( and not 3G), and it made the trip a lot nicer than trying to use my phone like I had in the past for e-mail and catching up in reader.Now for the downers....So I mentioned that there were a couple of problems, and they will probably all be fixed via software updates.  First off I had a heck of a time using the market when I first purchased the A500.  It would get stuck when it was suppose to download something.  I finally did a wipe of the data (fresh install again), and I had the same problem.  I realized that I had clicked on the update for google maps when it first loaded up, and after another wipe, I went to the market first, and had to accept the agreement, and then everything worked fine.  So, click on the Market icon first and accept the terms.*FIXED* -- Another thing that is annoying is that the screen keeps popping on when the tablet is not in use.  I was reading on some of the forums, that if you turn off wifi, or put the tablet in airplane mode, that it would stop doing this.  It seems to be that when it tries to do data updates in the background, it turns the screen on.  This is a minor annoyance, but it keeps the screen waking up, and it sucks battery.I have also had a one lockup that I had to hold down the power button till it turned off, and then turned it back on.  And once where the browser wouldn't load anything after clicking on a link in the google reader app.  I had to reboot the table to get this fixed.OverallI really like the tablet, and I think the issues I had above, will all be fixed by software updates as honeycomb becomes more mature.  I had a G1 when it first came out, and it was pretty much a mess when at the beginning.  As the software updates came along, it worked much better.  Using the tablet as a replacement for a laptop, works pretty good for surfing the web, and watching videos and such, though it could use more power in the browser area.  The battery life is better than my phone, but that just isn't saying much.  I really like the options that it presented (like the USB and HDMI ports), and the screen resolution, which is why I purchased this over the Asus transformer (need the dock for a normal usb port), and it was much cheaper than the Xoom(Verizon or WIFI) or G-Slate (T-Mobile), or the iPad2.  I also was more interested in an Android tablet over an iOS tablet, because I use a lot of Google services (GMail, Docs, Calendar, Reader, etc), and they work better on Android than they seem to on iOS, so it is much more convenient for me.  I bet within 3-6 months I will have to upgrade this to a 5 star review, but with the software problems as they are now, I just can't do it, even though I wouldn't get rid of the A500.

B0074WDDN8,electronics,How better is the image quality of this camera?,"I read numerous reviews about the OM-D E-M5 before making the purchase (from another vendor as Amazon now charges sales tax to CA residents). It has far exceeded my expectations. Beautiful to look at (I went with the silver) with its retro styling, very comfortable to hold, and and an incredible amount of customization. The IBIS is as good as people say, and the pictures are stunning especially when used with good glass. The kit lenses (14-42, 12-50) are ok, but you won't get the benefit of the great sensor with them. I'm using my OM-D with the Pany 25/1.4, Oly 45/1.8 and Oly 60/2.8 macro and am amazed at my results. And if you are on a budget, definitely take a look at the Sigma 19/2.8 and 30/2.8 being sold together for an unbelievable package price from the famous NY dealers. Both of them have excellent image quality and for 2 bills for the pair of lenses, you can't beat the price for 2 high quality primes. I just ordered the combo package as well though I will likely use the previously mentioned 3 on my OM-D and the 2 Sigmas on my Pen E-PL2 bodies (1 visible and 1 IR).And yes, after getting the OM-D, I realized I didn't want to lug around my heavy arsenal of Nikon bodies (D300, D7000) and lenses any longer. The image quality from the OM-D with the primes listed above far exceeds what I ever got from my Nikon setup so I had no hesitation in selling it all. And with my new setup being so small and light, I find I am much more likely to take it with me. The OM-D and Pany/Oly prime lenses have renewed my interest in photography and I am enjoying every minute.Note: The resolution, noise levels, and dynamic range of the OM-D are very comparable to the newest high end Nikon crop sensor bodies. It still doesn't compare to Nikon Full Frame bodies, obviously the sensor size does limit that, but given the cost of a FF body and FF (FX) lenses, not to mention the weight, I think 90% of photographers would be fine with this set-up.I hope this is helpful.

My iPhone 3GS fits in the dock even wearing a slim design shell case.  The remote seems to have good range and provides the delightful experience of being able to remotely control my mp3 player with no issues from distances of up to about 15 feet.  The remote is tiny and would be really easy to lose.As this system has on-board rechargeable batteries it is a simple matter of unplugging it to take with you and plugging it in again at your destination.  Battery life claims to be as high as 8 hours though we've never gotten close to that.

B001CCLBSA,electronics,How was the speed of the camera?,"First let me tell you what I have: Three Nikon reflex cameras (D70, D300, D200) a canon 5D as well as a bevy of film based cameras. I have had a Lumix FZ20, a Sony 717 and a Minolta 530.For the money the LX3 is simply amazing, but don't expect to be in the same league as the reflex camera, especially at high ISO. If there are lots of shadows I don't like using my LX3 above ISO 400 (that's a subjective assessment). I get about a 2 EV advantage with my D300.The zoom is not especially powerful, but it's so bright and compact I imagine it would have been difficult to design one that would have been at F/2.8 all the way.The depth of field is of course much greater than my larger cameras because the focal length is so small, so it can be an advantage in many situations, and a disadvantage for taking portraits.It doesn't feel that slow, probably because I expect compact cameras to be slow.The quality of the image stabilizer amazes me: I'm able to take many pictures inside museums and have had better results than with my reflexes when I wasn't using stabilized lens. Pictures at a 15th of a second are tack sharp.There is very little chromatic aberration in the lens.The flash is occasionally over-powerful.The video quality is so much better than what I had before.I take this camera everywhere, which is more than what I can say about my reflex cameras.It looks good.On the negative side the manual is not especially well written, but finally you can figure out a lot by just exploring the menus.All in all I would give it four and a half stars, but given the price and the use I get out of this camera I'll give it 5.

B000CSWCQA,electronics,What opinion do you have about the battery?,This is a real handy device for those who do not like to train in groups but still want some competition during their training/work out.I waited for some time buying it because there was no Mac support. However now that that is available there was no need to hold off any more. The device has so many function that I am still trying to find out what I can do with it. Fortunately the many discussion groups give a lot of support in that matter.There is one thing that is a bit of a down point and that is the length of the straps. My wrists are slightly bigger than the average one and I  can hardly close it.In any way from now on I have a very strict trainer that tracks all my actions.

B00740MR78,electronics,When can I give my opinion about the sound?,"I bought this camera to use with several Pentax lenses I already owned. I bought the &#34;body only&#34; kit so it would force me to use the Pentax lenses. The camera has some nice features that compensate for lenses that do not have auto focus, and I was able to figure this out after some time. Eventually I was able to use my zoom lens and several prime lenses, and one lens that did have auto focus. I found the focus peaking feature the best way to focus with the manual focus lenses. I was able to get several sharp photographs. However, I could not use it outside, I just could not see the screen in bright light. The only thing I could see was the focus peaking lines which helped me get a few good shots, but most outside shots were out of focus. Also the remote control software was minimal. I also discovered that when the HDMI cable is plugged in, it only supports playback and does not support live view. The battery life was dismal, it is more a function of how long the camera is on rather than the specified number of shots you can take. The battery was good for a few hours, then died. I would recommend this camera as an option for indoor and not-so-bright outdoor shooting, especially if you have Pentax lenses. Buy this camera with a factory lens and extra battery.

B004T1YAEI,electronics,How is the review?,"If your viewing room is bright a ccfl LCD display such as this Vizio should be just the ticket.I bought this display for my Mom who has a home with numerous windows. The TV has to compete with high levels of daytime ambient lighting and reflections. It does so admirably. The panel itself is not of the ""glossy"" type, which lends itself to reducing the reflections that some other displays ( notably plasmas with their glass surface ) have. In a perfect world, the Vizio would have a limited sheen bezel as well, but this is not the case. Piano black and very glossy.Connectability:  A full complement of connections are available and well thought out on this display. If you are going to connect any legacy equipment that requires analog connections you will not have the problem of running out of input jacks. (As a side note, be aware of the lower priced models. Vizio has ""dual purposed"" the component/composit jack pack making that connection an ""either/or"" situation.) A side jack pack is also available and is handy for temporary hookups.Ergonomics:  The remote is a classy little brick. The qwerty keyboard on the flip side proves to be very handy if you search frequently for various programming from your cable/sat provider or Netflix/Vudo or similar. My mother immediately said she would never use the keyboard until she found just how simple it is to use in comparison with the standard ""letter selection"" process normally found as your only option. Well done Vizio. I'd like to see some of the better universal programmable remotes have a qwerty keyboard as well.Side control options are poorly marked as usual, but since very rarely used, quite the norm.The stand has an interesting flaw. When properly connected to the panel itself, the display actually leans back a few degrees from vertical. Since LCD technology still requires us to be pretty much centered in front of the display, I found that I had to modify the stance with the effect of pointing the display to the sight line. Since the Vizio is even a touch fussier than some other makers in this regard, I was surprised at the lack of a swivel/tilt stand on this 3d capable display.Performance:  After making the connections and dialing in the built in wifi for the apps, a pleasantly simply procedure by the way, I immediately noticed the limited viewing angle issue mentioned before. Be aware of this if your seating configuration covers a wide area. Those outside of the somewhat limited ""sweet spot"" will not have the same viewing experience as the front and center crowd. If you are front and center although, a very nice bright image is viewed. The controls are all there if you wish to adjust for various lighting scenarios and as an ISF tech, I was pleased to see a full complement of drives and cuts to dial in the grayscale in the advanced user section. After setting the black and white level controls, I measured the contrast ratio at nearly 600 to one using the checkerboard ANSI pattern. Very decent for a ccfl LCD display. The primary and secondary color points were spot on and after dialing in the grayscale a bit, film DVD/BluRay viewing in a darkened room (evening in this case) proved the display to be quite capable. The 3D capability with the enclosed passive shades was not tested.Conclusion:  A lot of bang for the buck here. It is no wonder the once titans of tv's are scratching their heads. Vizio has a fine display here for a well lighted room with a casual viewer as the target market.d6500k ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3495, 3509)"
B000N99BBC,electronics,What happens to the ports if you plug it in?,"Switches are a big seller of mine and useful in many situations. They are the simplest networking device there is -- no setup, no configuration, just plug and go.This is used when you have a device that does the routing (a router than gives IP addresses) and you don't have enough ports for all of your wired devices. You can also use it in a situation where you have one computer jack in an office or room, but more than one device.I used a network cable to plug from the router to the new switch and plugged in my devices into the switch and they all instantly worked. If you are expecting a speed increase, make sure that your computer has a gigabit ethernet port -- most business computers have had that for quite a few years now and I'm not sure what they are putting in home computers.I also have installed more than a dozen of this exact switch (beginning in December 2011) in many locations without one failure so far.

B000PDR230,electronics,What port do you prefer?,"I have bought FIVE (5) Garmin GPS units, one Nuvi for the car and 4 handheld. The hardware is fine, but as many here have indicated, the product is only fully realized with good software maps, which are purchased separately (from Garmin). Now I have not had good luck with my handheld GPS's: one stopped working, I lost 2 of them, and a fourth got run over by a car in New Zealand. Of course no one would expect a replacement for a lost device, so I bought new ones FROM GARMIN. But I then had also lost use of the maps that I purchased, and Garmin will not authorize you to use a map you previously purchased on a new device. As was told to me by a (friendly) phone rep, Garmin makes most of its money on software.Now there are people who will cheat by perhaps selling or giving away a device with software and then ask for free replacements. So it's understandable that Garmin guards against that. But they are totally rigid about this policy, and my experience shows that it's greed rather than a concern about cheaters that is involved. When my expensive Garmin unit got run over and damaged, I offered to send the damaged unit back as proof that no one else was using the software, and they still insisted that I had to buy new software for the new GARMIN GPS I had just bought as a replacement.I think a customer-friendly company (like Amazon) would make some good-faith exceptions, especially with a customer who had bought so many of its products (and repeated software purchases). You should know before buying a Garmin product that Garmin is not that kind of company. The latest map involved is one that is 5 years old, not all that valuable, but still Garmin would not replace it. And the one that is on this device (the one that comes free with the Venture HC) is, as other reviewers note, not very good, so if you buy this product, you will probably also want to buy some good maps to go with it. Just know what the Garmin policy is about this and what kind of company mentality is involved. Don't think, for instance, that if you pay for the maps and then just decide to upgrade to a better device and want to send in the old one to Garmin to show you aren't using the maps on two device that you will not have to pay again for the software. You will have to pay, whatever the reason that you are not using it on the original device--because that's how Garmin makes more money. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2392, 2406)"

B001NJ0D0Y,electronics,How is the instruction?,"My old CPU cooler fan was on it's last leg and the whole thing was really caked up with dust, and this is a nice replacement. This is smaller and cools better, probably because it uses copper pipes instead of aluminum like the previous cooler. Fan noise is average, no different than the old fan. I have a big tower case so there is plenty of room for a large cooler like this. With a smaller more compact case you may want to check your clearance first. On the box it says it's 158.5mm tall, 120.0mm wide, 77.0mm deep.I like that the fan easily separates from the fins for cleaning, unlike my old cooler. It just clips on the side using no screws. Big plus for that design. You can put the fan on either side, but you want the air to flow in the same direction as your case fans.Comes with a variety of mounting hardware for different Intel and AMD CPUs. You can also position it to blow vertically or horizontally, depending on which way you want the air to flow. Although the mounting instructions are not that great at first glance, it did not take long to figure out what parts to use and how to use them. If this is your first time mounting a cooler, you don't need/want to overtighten the screws. Just snug will do nicely. You don't want to crack your motherboard and/or damage the internal wiring running by the screw holes. This isn't your car you are working on.I used Arctic Silver 5 instead of the included thermal paste. Go to Arctic's website for the correct way to apply it as it's different for each cpu type. My i7-920 is quad core so it calls for a side-to-side bead instead of a pea-sized drop in the middle. There are how-to videos and pics out there if this is your first time.SpeedFan 4.49 says my idle temp is 35C, and while running Prime95 it goes no higher than 61C. Intel says the absolute max i7 temp is 100C, which if ever reached, the software should shut everything down to protect the chip. Btw, they say it helps to 'burn in' the thermal paste by running Prime95 or whatever, as repeated heating and cooling actually makes the paste work better, but if you don't overclock then that's not really needed.I wanted to move to water cooling but read how some have leaked and the liquid destroyed very expensive video cards (seems they are always mounted below the cpu on a vertical motherboard). I have not heard if the cooler's manufacturers offer any kind of reimbursement for the damage, but who wants the hassle? I'm guessing the only way to avoid that is to lay the desktop on it's side where everything is hanging upside down from the motherboard. I'd rather have my tower case upright so I guess I'll stick to fans. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2651, 2665)"

B00DVFLJDS,electronics,Where can I get a form factor of a PDA?,"Earlier I did a review on my Nexus 7 on some tech forums, so I will just copy and past it here:I have been an iOS user for quite some time. When the Nexus 4 came out I decided to give it a shot and I loved it. I started using my iPad less and less because I enjoyed Android so much. Getting an Android tablet was next on my list, but I really wanted to wait for the 2013 Nexus 7 before trying it out. Once the Nexus 7 was announced, I quickly ordered one.The very first thing I noticed when taking it out of the box was its weight, or lack of. This thing is amazingly light and amazingly thin. Of course, the whole &#34;lighter and thinner&#34; quote is often said by Apple, but it can be easily applied to the new Nexus 7.Of course, the screen is another great thing about it. The 323 ppi is just 3 ppi short of the retina display on the iPhone. And for a device that will typically be held further away than a 4&#34; screen, this display is fantastic. It can be extremely bright and colors look fairly good so far. Viewing angles are pretty good. But my biggest complaint about the screen is how glossy it is. I would love to see more manufacturers start to implement the same kind of anti-glare glass that was put on the RMBP. Of course, this is dependent on Gorilla Glass, but hopefully they will start trying to decrease glare. Also, fingerprints get pretty obvious after a fair amount of use. But that is to be expected. The back of the device also seems to enjoy fingerprints. But this doesn't bother me on the back. And the back of the device has a nice finish to it making it comfortable to hold.The weight, size, and resolution of the Nexus 7 makes it a fantastic eReader. However, when it comes to web browsing the screen does feel small. This makes me wish it was a Nexus 8 instead of a Nexus 7, but I guess that could have increased the price. This is one area where I think Apple did a great job. Just a 1&#34; difference really does a lot to improve overall user experience when browsing the web. Sure, you can argue resolution, ppi, and throw all sorts of small numbers at the iPad Mini to make it look awful in comparison. But the screen size and aspect ratio really make it a great device for browsing the web and reading.When it comes to movies, the Nexus 7 is great. Although the 16:10 aspect ratio means you will still see black bars on the top and bottom on nearly every movie you watch. But the sound coming from the Nexus 7 is amazing. Google and Asus did a great job with dual speakers. However, in landscape mode the speakers are right where you are going to put your hands. So you may end up muffling the sound a little bit. The front bezels would have made a much better spot to put the speakers. Then they would have at least had some sort of excuse for the Texas-sized bezels. In fact, I watched a review online and the new Nexus 7 is taller than the old one. Meaning the top and bottom bezels are slightly bigger than last year!The simulated surround sound is a nice addition. And music sounds great. With movies, I have them all on Plex. So I am not sure how the Nexus 7 handles audio playback through Plex when watching a movie. And I know this may never happen, but it would be great if Google could do what they did with Google Music to personal movie collections. Obviously they would be worried about pirated movies. But I have a lot of DVDs that I got on my computer using HandBrake. And having that kind of functionality would be great. But I'm not holding my breath.The cameras seem to be decent. I have not tested them extensively yet, but for a tablet all you really need cameras for are for video chatting. And every video chat service will have to decrease the quality for streaming anyways.Wireless charging is a cool addition. It seems to work with my Nexus 4 wireless charger. However, I am still not a fan of Qi charging. Calling it wireless is just deceptive. Are wires still involved? Yes. Thus, not wireless. Plus using it on a wireless charger makes it much more difficult to use while the device is charging. If I have my Nexus 7 plugged into the cable, I can still play games that use the accelerometer. Can't easily do that with a wireless charger. Plus wireless chargers take longer to completely charge the device.Battery life is hard to determine at the moment since I just got it. I will need to update this section when I have more time with the device.Now that I have used it a full day, battery life isn't as good as I had hoped. Not even close really. I will post screen shots.The 2GB RAM and S4 Pro help the Nexus 7 feel speedy. However, it is still not perfectly smooth. Some parts of the UI will encounter some hiccups every now and then. Specifically dealing with the recent apps button and in some cases the home button freezing for a second or two. Nothing major, but this device still encounters minor lag.I find it odd that there is no vibrator motor in the Nexus 7. Sure, it may not be a priority, but adding one couldn't cost too much.Now that I have gone over the hardware, time to touch on the software. Android 4.3 is a minor update, and maybe it should have just been 4.2.3.Tablet app selection is still far inferior to iPads. Although, the Nexus 7 feels less like a tablet and more like a large phone. I'm not really sure how to explain this part, but is just doesn't feel like a tablet. Of course, 7&#34; is considered the smallest size screen a tablet can be, so I guess that makes sense. But when you have 5&#34; phones, 10&#34; tablets, and then a device with a 7&#34; screen, the screen size is closer to phones than tablets.Most apps work fine and are the exact same as the phone app, just scaled up. Some of the default Google Apps, like People and Calendar, are slightly different. But they feel squeezed, especially People.When it comes to third party apps, most function fine. However, Evernote keeps crashing on me. It will not open at all. Same with Slice. Whether or not this is due to Android 4.3 or the device itself, I don't know. Maybe someone can shed some light on this?Also, I am starting to find apps that are incompatible with the Nexus 7. I have never had this problem before with the Nexus 4. But one game I play quite often, Blitz Brigade, is not compatible. What's weird is that the Nexus 7 has the same CPU and RAM as the Nexus 4! Why it is incompatible I have no idea. But this is very frustrating.Ultimately, the best things about the Nexus 7 are its price, screen, and speakers. Android is a great phone OS, but it just doesn't feel as good on a tablet. The Android tablet experience definitely feels lacking in certain ways. But I expect this to improve as the OS matures.One thing in particular I do not like about the tablet experience is the lack of synchronized notifications. For example, I just got a notification from the default calendar app about an event coming up. I got the notification on both my Nexus 7 and Nexus 4. And I have the same Google Calendar synced on both devices. Yet if I dismiss the notification on one device, I am still required to dismiss it on the other device. Synchronized notifications is something that is sorely needed in Android.The Nexus 7 is a great and affordable way to get a foot in the Android tablet arena. If you are on the fence about it, you should definitely buy it and give it at least a week and see how you like it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(7378, 7392)"

Keys are intuitively placed and function keys are very helpful.  My only disappointment is unavoidable as I had to discard my protective two sided cover which provided considerable more protection.

B004E10KFG,electronics,Is the unit very compact?,"I never imagined I would spend $200 on a tiny wireless speaker system but the rave review by David Pogue in the New York Times swayed me to splurge.It was delivered in about 36 hours to my door. BUT after spending frustrating hours trying to get it to work - software downloads from the Jawbone website and phone support from their eager staff - it was decided that the unit was defective and should be returned. Unhappy, I persuaded them to ship the replacement unit overnight. Jawbone will not pay for return shipping of a defective unit or provide a shipping label, believe it or not for such a pricey purchase, so I add another $10 to the $200 I already paid. So I only rate the Jambox as four stars because they have a quality control problem and a mean-spirited return policy for their stupid defective units.Now, happily with minimal effort as I already had the required software loaded, the tiny unit can play music streamed via Bluetooth from both my iPhone and iPad anywhere in my apartment without the unit being anywhere near them. As David Pogue said - ""Magic!"" AND it also acts as a cell phone answerer and speakerphone with built-in microphone. When the unit is on it will automatically silence the speakers on my iPhone or iPad and hold this stream if a phone call comes in at the same time. The sound quality is much better than I expected from a palm-sized 12oz gadget. I can walk around the house taking it from room to room as I do other things and listen at the same time to my music. I can watch videos and streaming movies on my iPhone or iPad with great big sound instead of tinny little sound from the mini-speakers in the devices. Somehow this big sound makes the videos seem much more compelling to watch. I can hear no buzzing, hissing or other wireless interference so the sound is completely clean to listen to classical music.Pressing a button on top of the unit brings a voice that tells you how much battery life is left. It is claimed to play for 10 hours before needing re-charge but I haven't yet tested this.I can imagine taking this with me on car journeys to listen to music on my iPhone and answer phone calls on the road with just the press of one button and no driving distraction.

B009LL9VDG,electronics,How do you have the number?,"I just finished a graduate program and have used this for over a year now, as a student, a job-seeker, an employee, and just for random daily tasks. I'll speak personally from how this has helped me in my specific situation, in case there is someone who may be in a similar situation.There are a few things about me that made me a great fit for this product:1) I own a desktop computerThere are some things I need a desktop for, and I have a desktop computer for those occasions. Interestingly, one of the things I learned is how little I really needed my desktop. I packed it away and didn't bother unpacking it for two months now. If anything it's probably a good thing that I can't play video games on this thing, so if you're a recovered game addict with relapsing tendencies (like yours truly), that's something to consider. But there are some things I'll definitely need the desktop for, such as photo editing, which I will eventually need to unpack the desktop to do.2) I use Google everything (gmail, drive, calendar, etc.)And so do a lot of my friends, making it very easy to work on Google and share my work with others. The suite of Google office products are pretty handy, and for most uses is more than sufficient. Because google docs do not count against your size limit on Google Drive, it feels like unlimited storage to me, and I've done just fine without any additional storage.3) I use Amazon Prime (mainly for movies, Kindle books)The vast majority of ""apps"" that you can add on the chromebook do little more than provide you a link, turning the bottom bar into a glorified ""favorites"" bar. The kindle is one exception, since you are able to download books for offline reading. Since I watch all my movies through Amazon Prime, it's not a big deal that there's no DVD player.4) I intend to carry this around all over the placeThis is ideal for carrying around because it's light and thin (I just leave it in my bag and I never think ""dang it, I shouldn't have brought my laptop today"") the battery life is great (I never really have to bring the charger unless I forgot to charge it the night before) and it's cheap (I've dropped it and I've dropped the bag it's in many times, but it hasn't broken yet, and I wouldn't be totally bummed as I would be if I dropped some other really expensive thin light laptop).5) The places I go have wifi anywayStarbuck's, McDonald's, school, library, etc. In my neighborhood there are a lot of places to go for free wifi.A few reasons why this product was not a good fit:1) Skydrive is not that good.This isn't Google's fault, but it does affect my review of whether or not you should buy this chromebook, because the chromebook is only as good as the apps that what it can run in the browser. The truth is that Skydrive is nowhere close to the much more robust Google Drive. It technically does a lot of the same things, and in some ways it is indeed better than Google drive at handling MS Office documents, but I've had too many instances where the website would fail and I would lose something I had been working on. No matter how many bells and whistles it has, the fact that it can't reliably work on things has made me lose hope on skydrive, so now if I really want to fine-tune a MS Office document, I have to find a PC.2) It's kind of weak sauce.It's okay with most things, and I can watch movies on it full-screen, but sometimes it's just slow, especially if you have a lot of tabs open. I've learned to be a lot more disciplined about tab-closing, and that's helped, but at some point the thing is just slow, and when I'm trying to work with two windows at the same time, scheduling things and responding to e-mails and such, there's a slight lag that will make things take longer than they would otherwise.CONCLUSION:If you're a no-frills kind of person and you're looking for something like this, then I recommend it, especially if you're broke like me. It doesn't have a lot of (or any, really) bells or whistles, but it can get quite a bit done. The times are a-changin', and as the cloud expands in the size and diversity of products they offer, this will become even more useful over time. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4163, 4177)"
B002LITT42,electronics,How is the image quality?,"I have to assume that the folks who have had problems with this camera either have not completely read the manual that comes with it or are too quick on the trigger for shooting (all digital cameras need a second to focus properly before fully depressing the button), or they received a lemon (which is why companies provide warranties) and they should have either return the camera to Amazon, as defective, for a replacement or to Canon for fixing.  I have found Canon Service to be Excellent over the years.  I have used them on a couple of occasions.  On one, the camera was well over a year out of warranty, the cost to me was going to be about $149 to fix.  After they received it, they wrote to me that this was a component that has been failing, and should not, and thus there would be no charge for the service.  Now, I can not ask for a more honest, customer oriented manufacturer than these folks.Now, it is true that because there is a ""popup"" flash, I needed to learn to hold the camera differently.  The way Canon suggested is Great as it gives me, and the camera, far more stability than the old way. I did use my left hand finger on top of the camera in a pincer hold with my other fingers.  Now, it is cradled in my left hand between my thumb and second finger with the first finger cradled along the side of the lens giving me far less shake.  By the way, this flash sure does light things up far better than my other cameras with the built in flash on the front!!!Thus far, the zoom shots have been awesome, everyone is raving about the quality of the pictures I have taken of them,, Low light shots are unbelievably clear as if I was using a flash and the day shots are great.  This Powershot S90 is a super digital camera.Thank you Cannon for a Great Camera. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1779, 1793)"
B002C7481G,electronics,How many wins do you have in this game?,"Before buying my iPad, I spent about an hour in the Apple store playing with it.  I knew I'd get some real use from it, and I knew that it met many of my wants for an ultraportable computer, but the tiny underpowered thing costs almost as much as a macbook!Obviously, I laid down my credit card and walked out of the store with it.  The store is near my office but three hours from my home.  I must admit, I had regrets in the three hour drive home.  A $900 10"" iPod touch?  Am I nuts?After owning and using it for two weeks, I no longer regret the purchase as much, but I still feel that it is overpriced.  My model is the 64GB with 3G+Wifi.  I spent about $900 including tax to buy it at the Apple store and another ~$60 on ""HD"" apps including the iWork suite: pages, numbers, and keynote.  I do have an iPhone so I already owned a lot of apps that work with the tablet.I have found myself using it mostly for four things: document viewing for work, email, web browsing, and games.I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've been using it for games, but I have played several and really enjoyed them.  I'm not a ""gamer"" at all.  I own a Wii that only gets used for watching Netflix movies on my television.  Video games are usually boring to me.  There are quite a few games designed for adults filled with puzzles and brain teasers that will change your view of computer games.  No matter who you are or how adult you think you are: you will wind up using this thing for games.  It's too fun to play games on it not to.  I recommend Labyrinth 2 HD, Osmos HD, Pinball HD, tChess Lite, and a good Solitare game.Back to getting work done: it's pretty great for email.  I have a work blackberry and a personal iPhone.  I get lots of spreadsheet and other document attachments.  Blackberry is terrible at displaying documents.  Iphone does an OK job.  This thing is a desktop replacement as a document viewer.  It isn't as good as having MS office on a PC, but you can definitely get a great view of a document with a lot of formatting intact.  It isn't really better than iPhone for viewing messages, but viewing attachments on the big screen is worlds better.  The only complaint I have about email is that it lacks the ability to thread conversations and show all email inboxes in one list like the ios4 iphone devices.  It will have those abilities this fall when it gets upgraded to ios4, but for now switching between inboxes is a bit awkward.More on document viewing.The biggest help to me at work is document viewing.  I can carry promotional materials, examples of past promotions, old communications, files for reference, presentations, price lists, spec sheets, manuals, photos, trade journals, books, and any other digital document imaginable and access them all easily when with a customer or simply to find info to make me more effective.  The iPad does not include a file system like finder or windows explorer.  The iWork apps have a documents folder, but those folders are not accessible by other apps.  All of the apps include a shortcut to open a document in other apps, but not having a universal finder app is annoying.  If you are in mail you can choose to open an attachment in Pages then email any changes back to the person, but it goes against the way we have all become accustomed to working on PCs and Macs.  There are file system and viewer apps.  I've tried two I like and one that I highly recommend: Goodreader.  Goodreader gives you a place to organize your files into folders for various projects and info.  It has viewers for office file formats, PDF files, and limited graphics files (sorry, there are no eps, ai, or similar art viewers for ipad that I've discovered yet).  Goodreader allows you to transfer files to the ipad via wifi networking, wifi using a web browser on a PC or Mac, using the USB cable, or using itunes.  Best thing about Goodreader: it's only one dollar.The built-in photos app is great.  I used my mac to convert a lot of documents to jpgs just so I could use the photos app to view and display them.  Integration between the photos app and the iwork apps and mail is great.  Syncing albums between a Mac or PC and the Photos app is a snap.  The photos app is where the ""magical"" in the ads comes from.  It is a delight to browse images using the app.  I'm sure you can find countless youtube videos demonstrating it if you look.  For under five dollars, you can buy Photogene or a similar app for useful photo editing on the ipad.Web browsing is the other ""killer app.""  Lots of people complain that iPad doesn't support flash, but I honestly don't miss it.  Most big web sites recognize that you're using an ipad and deliver non-flash versions of videos.  My biggest concern is the lack of RAM in the ipad.  The lack of RAM shows when web browsing.  If you switch between open pages, most of those pages will be reloaded because it doesn't cache much; it can't cache much with only 256mb of ram.  As long as switching between pages, and having them reload when doing so isn't a huge issue to you, web browsing on the ipad using Safari is a desktop-like experience.  I have just recently started using a third party browser called ""Atomic Web.""  Atomic web adds useful multitouch gestures, tabs, full screen, and adblock to the Safari browser.  I highly recommend Atomic Web for the $2 they charge for it.  It works great.The app store lets you add tons of functionality to your machine.  Count on spending $50+ depending on what you want to do with your machine.  I love the three $10ea iWork apps, the $5 photo editor, the handful of $5-$10 games I own, and the multitude of free periodical reader apps I downloaded.Watching and listening to media in ipad is really great.  The iPod interface looks like an older version of iTunes on a Mac.  Video looks great.  I've always been a fan of desktop itunes for syncing with ipod and iphone.  Ipad is exactly like iphone and ipod when interacting with the desktop.  The built in speakers in ipad are louder and sound better than iPhone and iPod touch.  They are nearly as loud as the ones on my Macbook Pro 13"".  The speakers are great for listening to podcasts or watching a movie in bed or in your comfy chair.Google maps and google earth are a desktop-like experience on ipad.Battery life is where ipad kicks laptop tail.  I easily get 8+ hours from a charge.Typing on ipad in landscape mode is about like typing on a netbook; you wouldn't want to write a long document on it but it's fine for email and composing short documents and memos.  It's a lot better than I expected.  Typing in portrait mode is a bit of a chore.You WILL need to buy a case for it.  The ""acase"" brand ipad case that sells for $26 here at Amazon is a great choice (and the highest rated case on Amazon).  You will not be able to find an Apple case for it.  Apple cannot meet demand for ipad accessories.  The camera connection kit (usb and card reader) are also impossible to find.I'm glad I bought the largest (64GB) model.  I currently only have 25GB free after putting in 20GB of music, 8GB of films, 5GB of apps, and around 2GB of documents.  64 GB is really very ideal, but anything less would be crowded unless you don't plan to use the ipod or video player much.I bought the 3G service for it and don't regret it.  I live in the midwest and ATT has decent service here.  I am paying $15/month (no contract) for 256MB.  2GB is available for $25/mo.  I bought the cheaper plan because I have frequent access to wifi, but wanted the ability to look at email adn documents on the road if the occasion arises.  So far just using 3G for email and very infrequent browsing 256mb is plenty.  I highly recommend buying a 3G model unless you are sure that you will always have Wifi access when you use it.  It's a lot less useful if you can't connect to the web.In conclusion, this thing is very useful and very expensive.  I use it a lot.  I use my PC and my Mac a lot less now.  I carry it to places that I wouldn't consider lugging a PC to.  It allows me to carry a lot more info and digital files than I ever did before.  It makes me more effective and allows me to travel lighter.  Is it worth slightly over $1000 after buying a case and apps?  I'm still not 100% sure.  Do I love it?  yes.

B00BGGDVOO,electronics,How much amount of space this have?,"The Roku 3 sounds like a good idea. According to the specs and reviews it has good features. But the first one I got did not work, I got a second one and it does not work either. I searched for help, there is none for the problem both of these units have. I wrote to Roku's customer service and got no response at all. It appears to have a significant design flaw; I suspect it is in the unit's software.You may be thinking I just don't know how to use it and don't follow directions, but that would be wrong. I am a very senior engineer and I design chips similar to the one used in the Roku, and I use similar technology all the time. I am a professional at debugging electronics and did all the sensible tests. Other source devices work perfectly with the exact same cables & TV. I could bring it into the lab but it's not worth my time. I updated the software in the first one, it did not make any difference. It is clear these Roku 3 units have a serious problem. And Roku could not be bothered responding to this customer's written request.Symptoms? Upon power-on, the Roku's display on the TV has very bad flickering, with blinking horizontal bands all over the display. It is completely consistent. It does not happen with any other source devices.So, if you get one and it works, you're lucky, but if it doesn't you are out of luck and you might as well return it right away.This is most unfortunate, and a significant waste of time.

B002R5AM7C,electronics,What is the main control of the console?,"Opening the box was like an opening an Apple product (iPhone or iPad). Thepackage design was simple and clean. I enjoyed this kind of simple joy whenopening a new product, yet I think it's only possible when a companyprofoundly designs its packaging as well as its product; this makes it feel asif I am unveiling a mystery, and this gadget gave me this feeling!Here are the list of pros:Easy file transferring - just plugged it into USB port, and the new driveappeared on my desktop screen. Then I just dragged the files I wanted to copyout from the folder. I heard that there are some people having issues with themino's built in USB plug, but I did not have any issues. I even tried a coupleof different ports, and it worked flawlessly, although it seemed a bit heavyhanging the whole camcorder in my desktop's USB port (but it workednonetheless!). Things such as 4 port USB hub or USB extension cable wouldsolve the issue if necessary.Doesn't feel cheaply built - I love the brushed metal feel to it. It might bea bit heavier than other plastic camcorders, but it feels very nice when Ihold and shoot. The built quality is excellent and the whole unit feels quitesturdy.Compact - It fits perfectly even in my small hand, and I am still able tocontrol all the buttons in the back with my thumb. The size is smaller thanthe iPhone so the grip is very good to hold and shoot (and it shoots HD, whichthe iPhone does not).Touch sensitive buttons - very useful if I shoot outdoors, such as at thebeach or playground sandbox. There is no need to worry about sand graingetting stuck in between buttons and the body. And the touch sensitivity iswonderful.Basic accessories - It comes with a soft case and a wrist strap. The softcase is very useful when you carry it around.Bigger space and longer battery life - This camcorder is designed to shootlonger than the first generation mino HD; therefore, it has about 8GB ofmemory space and a 2 hour lasting battery life. It's more than enough memoryspace and battery life to shoot outdoor activities or events.HDMI out - It's kind of standard these days, so it's a handy feature when Iam anxious to watch the clips on the big screen tv. I simply connect directlyto the TV using a HDMI cable, and it works without any issues.Video quality - Typically, I would not expect a super amazing video qualityout of this tiny camcorder, but mino's 720p HD is more than what I expected.With good weather (enough light), the video quality is amazing, and I can'tcomplain, but under low lighting, I found the video quality disappointing.It's a common limitation of these type of small consumer camcorders, I think;therefore, I am not too surprised about this aspect.There is one thing I wish it came with:The lens cover - It would protect the lens from my kid and blocks dust whenit's not in use. There is, however, a protective glass (or transparent cover)built in, and I think it could be more practical, actually. I can just wipe itwith my finger or something quickly.Overall, this is the simplest and easiest HD camcorder. Settings are easy andthe control buttons are simple and self-explanatory. The only thing to worryabout is what to shoot. The price is worthy, and frankly speaking, I've beenquite content with the camera. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3258, 3272)"
B001S4OTS6,electronics,How do you like the need?,"I'm the ripe old age of 28 and grew up with computers - from the Apple II's used at my elementary school (mainly for Oregon Trail) to the slew of Windows based PCs I've used ever since. Always at the forefront of computer-human relations has been the keyboard and mouse (at least in my lifetime). It's no surprise then to see just how many companies try year after year to perfect this interface.Microsoft's effort with the Wireless Desktop 3000 is a noble effort worthy of praise.So in a nutshell here is what I like:Keyboard:+ Very stylish looking.+ A subtle contour that feels just right when typing.+ They keys are a cross between a standard desktop and a laptop keyboard. The keys make a satisfying ""click-clap"" when typing.+ WIRELESS! Say goodbye to those messy wires and hello to a clean desktop!+ 2 extra USB ports freed up (thanks to the wonders of wireless technology)!+ Integrated wrist-rest made from a soft-rubbery type of material.+ Plenty of integrated and customizable shortcuts to everything from email, calculator and multi-media functions.Mouse:+ Again stylish looking - I'm a sucker for Blue LED's of any type!+ Rubberized grips on the sides of the mouse are very comfortable.+ Integrated ""back"" & ""forward"" buttons are placed perfectly.+ Scroll wheel is heavy and super-smooth.+ Clicking the scroll wheel brings up a super-cool way to switch between apps - think Alt+Tab but better looking.+ The BlueTrack technology in the mouse is supposed to work on just about anything but glass or mirrored surfaces. In my experience this is true - except of course I can't throw away my mouse pad just yet as I have a glass-top desk.There are a few things that I don't like:Keyboard:- The ""function"" keys are small and evenly spaced across the top of the keyboard. This makes finding a specific 'Fx' key challenging.- No back-lighting whatsoever - obviously to save power but still.- Installing the included software does add more functions but takes an absurd amount of time for install - think more than 15 minutes! This is a keyboard and mouse not anti-virus software!I was a bit worried when I read that this combo operates in the 2.4GHz spectrum. I run a wireless network in my home and can pick up 6 different networks in my area. My fears of interruptions have thus far been unfounded. Everything works swimmingly! The keyboard and mouse each take 2 'AA' batteries and I've been using the same rechargeable batteries in mine for the past 2 months without a hiccup. According to Microsoft I should be able to squeeze out 12 months out of my batteries - we'll see. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2580, 2594)"
B001UQ6F4S,electronics,Do you have a big problem?,"I kept this unit for about a week before deciding to return it. It is not terrible at all, but a couple items were real dealbreakers for me:1) Low volume level on DVD and Blu-Ray playbackThis must be something specific to LG. I have an LG DVR (LRM-519) that is a few years old and it has the exact same problem. When I play Blu-Ray discs or regular DVDs, I have to turn the volume on my TV or Sony AV Receiver way, way up just to hear the movie at a normal level. I was watching Baby Mama and had to crank my Receiver up to the max volume just to hear it. It is connected with an optical cable, but I have the same issue with the volume through the TV which is connected using HDMI. I previously had my Xbox 360 connected to my AV Receiver and DVDs sounded amazing. I didn't have to turn up the receiver past 45 to get it really booming. With the LG BD 370, I had to crank it at 70 (max).2) The player uses the same remote IR commands as my LG DVRVery few other people will probably run into this problem, but the BD 370 happens to use the same remote control commands as my existing LG DVR. So, for example, when I turn on the BD 370, the DVR also turns on. When I press the Open/Close button on the remote, the DVD tray on both my DVR and Blu-Ray player open. When I press Menu on the remote, it brings up the menu on my DVR and my blu-ray player. This was just an annoyance at first until I realized that watching netflix or a bluray disc on the BD 370 could actually cause me to stop something from recording on my DVR due to the random command being sent to the DVR as I control the blu-ray player.3) Netflix only shows Instant QueueI admit, this is a very minor gripe, but I really got spoiled by the Netflix experience on my Xbox 360. On the xbox 360, the netflix menu shows not only the movies you have added to your instant queue, but also lets you browse a selection of shows/movies in other categories. I have found that I use that feature a lot. So I was pretty disappointed to see that it isn't replicated on the BD 370. However, the quality of the streaming on the BD 370 was every bit as good as on the Xbox 360. Also, I had zero problems connecting to netflix when I hooked up the player. I just connected the player to my router with an ethernet cable and it had no problem getting on netflix.Pro - The ability to watch Youtube on the BD 370 was cool, especially because it allowed me to log into my Youtube account and access my favorites. However, that was not enough to make me want to keep the player.All in all, if you don't mind the low volume level and you don't have any other LG DVD players or DVRs connected to the same TV as the BD 370, it is a pretty decent unit.

Even that mouse is better than this one.The biggest problem with this mouse is the tendency to double click when a button has been clicked once.  It started two months after I got the mouse.  At first it was now and then, making me think I'd clicked twice.  Six months later, it's a constant thing, probably about 80% of the time.The tracking is also not great.  With a mouse pad it's bearable, without one it's impossible.  Either way, sometimes small movements just don't happen at all.  I'm never really sure where the pointer will be when I move the mouse.The three year battery life was good for about 6 months.  To me that's not a big deal.  I've usually got batteries on hand because we go through them quickly in remotes, so if that was the only problem with this mouse it would hardly be worth mentioning.The shape of the mouse is comfortable, and the scroll wheel is fantastic.

I'm just going to say that the screen looks great, speakers are the best ever, and it's solid.But what I will include in my review is a few opinions.1) the bigger version is better.  Yeah it's the same hardware and software for the most part, but the extra screen space is really really worthwhile.  If you've got *any* spare cash, please consider 8.9 over the 7.2) accessories that should be included.  Amazon was great enough to include a USB cable, but that's it.  No covers, bumpers, screen protect or even a charger.  Yulp, not even a charger.  You do get the option to bundle things at a discount when you buy this, and it's to your best interest to do so.  Pick up the charger for $9.99, because when you change your mind later on, it's $19.99 separately.  Also, if you consider going mobile or throwing it in your purse, consider a screen protector or cover.  It will reduce the greatness of the screen slightly, but you really don't want scratches.  A spare cable is also really nice if you travel a lot.3) Ads.  It really urks me that you have to pay to have ads removed.  This is just amazon milking a little more money from the customer base.  You can find very similar tablets that match features and hardware for $199.99 that doesn't cram advertisements on your device.Overall I would not purchase this device for myself.  I feel that pricing it for $199 is kind of dishonest.  It cost to remove ads, it cost to add a charger, by the time you're said and done it's really closer to $225 before tax.  For relatively the same hardware and features and $199 price tag, I would recommend Nook HD or Nexus 7.  The only plus side is the tight integration to Amazon's electronic services.

Honestly Wii has the best Netflix interface, but the one here is a close second, and since the Wii requires another remote, this is the winner. There is no ""search"" feature which the Wii interface has, but the built in categories are far superior and a bit comical to boot.Cons: It's a hundred bucks... The Netflix interface could have a search, but not a deal breaker.

Don't take this wrong, it does not happen often and is definitely not a deal killer or anything; just nature of the beast. Just understand every now and then you need to re-boot it. Speaking of, an actual power button would be nice for this reason.

I can clip it to my clothes, no problem and it stays secure!* 8 gigs of storage!Things I don't mind but you might not like about it:* the display is small, and takes a bit to figure out how to navigate. If this is not your first digital MP3 player, this won't be a problem, but it's a bit of an adjustment.* the display is black with bright blue LED.  Unlike the black on pale-grey of the Nano.  Again, I find this handy, and actually easier to read in the dark, but you might find it glaring.* because it's really just an MP3 player, unlike a full on sexy Ipod, you can't really store pictures or anything other than audiofiles here.

B005CLPP84,electronics,How is the guy?,"The Roku media player is one of the best choices you can make when it comes to streaming media devices.  Being an early adopter (I own one of the first 2000 units sold in the US), and owning three Roku players in total, I can say that I am a heavy user and a true believer.  I love the freedom of choice in content the Roku player gives you, with over 100 channels to chose from, including the ubiquitous Netflix streaming catalog, access to Amazon's vast catalog of movies, Crackle, Epic, Break!, Pandora and many, many more.  Some channels are subscription based, while others are free.  However, the abilities of the newest generation of Roku players, the Roku 2, also support 3D graphics and gaming, presented in the form of the now-familiar, downloadable ""app"".  From simple games like Reversi and Mahjongg, to Chess and Angry Birds, the Roku 2 is poised to compete with the likes of the Wii, though that time may still be some distance in the future.  However, right now Angry Birds can be yours for free when you purchase a new Roku 2 player.  Who doesn't like Angry Birds, right?Compared to the original Roku player (now the HD model) and the 2nd gen XDS model, the newest hi-end Roku player, the Roku 2 XS, takes its place at the top of the line-up with authority.  The XS unit does everything the other Roku 2 players can do, plus it comes with USB and Ethernet ports, which the two lower end models don't have, though all models of Roku player are wireless capable.  In addition, with the XS model, you receive a motion control remote (think Wii), which can double as a game-pad when you turn it sideways.  To go with this fancy new remote, you also get a free copy of Angry Birds!  The remote control alone MSRPs for $30.00 if you buy one separately, making its addition to the XS package a real value, in my opinion.  Free Angry Birds is just icing on the cake.With a MicroSD card you can expand the storage capabilities of the Roku 2, allowing you to install more games, and presumably, other content in the future.  Best of all, this is a standard feature on all Roku 2 players.  I did have a little trouble inserting my 2GB MicroSD card the first time.  I figured out that you have to push the card into the slot a lot further than I was expecting, requiring a good finger nail to get it in far enough to click into place.  Once I got that figure out, no further problems using the SD card slot have become apparent.  You will be prompted upon boot-up to format a new SD card, which is the only way to tell you have a memory card installed, as far as I can tell.  After seeing the prompt to format the MicroSD card and confirmation of a successful format, you never see anything else about the MicroSD card ever again.  I assume mine is still working, but I have no way to tell.  It would be nice to see something in the settings menu regarding the external SD card, maybe showing used/free space and mounted/un-mounted status.The 2GB MicroSD card I am using (Kingston brand) was purchased with the Roku 2 XS and an HDMI cable directly from Roku.  I believe the Roku 2 will support larger than 2GB SD cards, but there is nothing in the documentation about it.  I am trying to get verification of this before I try a larger MicroSD card.As for performance, I couldn't be happier.  Content loads quickly and runs seamlessly.  I have a 6Mbps DSL line and have little trouble streaming from two Roku players at the same time, both using my wireless router for access to the Internet.  The Roku players take a little while to boot up, however, they pretty much stay on all the time, so this point isn't terribly significant.  On the other hand, none of the various Roku player models have an on-off switch, which I personally don't like.  I want to turn my electronics off when not in use.  I'd really like to see Roku add a power switch to their players.  I have my XDS player plugged into the back of my surround receiver, which in this case is a switched plug.  When I turn the receiver on or off, the Roku player also gets turned on or off.  The other players are plugged into regular outlets, so I actually have to unplug those to turn them off, which can be rather inconvenient where power outlets are not readily accessible.You can use multiple Roku players in your home without interference from each other.  Do be aware, however, that any Roku remote will work with any Roku 2 player.  This has positive and negative aspects, though I'd say mostly positive.  For the most part, there is little reason to have more than one remote at this time, but I fully expect games developed in the future to support multiplayer, making additional remotes a must for those interested in gaming on the Roku 2.  You have to pair the new remote with the XS, and I had trouble with this at first, but I think it's because there was another standard Roku remote in the room during setup.  After removing the batteries from the older remote and rebooting the Roku 2 XS, I was able to make a successful pairing using the manual pairing option from the settings menu.  The new remote works well for standard Roku menu controls, but it really shines when you try it out with Angry Birds.  It is a little twitchy at first, but you quickly get used to the sensitivity.  It would be nice to see an addition to the settings menu for adjusting the sensitivity of the motion controller, but it isn't too bad at its default setting.  With a little practice, you'll be flinging those birds exactly where you want them!Overall, the Roku players have been a great addition to my entertainment options at home.  There is room for improvement, but I believe Roku has the best product offerings even so.  From the first Roku player with nothing but Netflix, to the current generation of Roku players supporting Angry Birds, Roku has made a real winning multimedia product.  Streaming media is only just now coming into full swing, and the Roku players have made much of it possible from the very beginning.  I am the happy owner of three Roku players, and I love them all.  I would heartily recommend them to all of my friends and family, many of whom are already Roku customers. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6165, 6179)"

Very impressive VR works well.Very simple, easy to use interface.Great value at current pricing.Sleek, compact design.Screen is bright and easy to read.Free map updates (within 60 days of first use)Software updated to fix issues recently. (v4.70)FM transmitter -- though depends on your car.  Also has audio out/headphone jack.Can download lots of freebies like new voices, new vehicles, games, and so on.  (Some of the games aren't too bad.)Useful Pedestrian mode and ""last location"" feature (where did I park my car?), off road (find your way back to car after hunting/hiking in woods) and so on.Can optimize multi-stop routes for speed and efficiency (would be great for deliveries, for example).On board HELP.Cons:No printed manual.  Garmin can't include a proper printed manual?  Shame. They included plenty of color advertising brochures, cards, and such.No A/C adapter (optional extra) -- but you can use most any A/C to USB adapter.Even with latest map update, some new businesses in my area and a large development site not listed.Remarks:I just got my 855 and am quite happy with it.  I've only used it for trips around town, so far, so I need more time to give it a thorough test, but I thought I would go ahead and post some information which may be helpful to some of you. My initial impressions are good.  The user interface is probably the easiest to use of any of my GPS devices.  Screen is bright and clear.  Everything works as expected.In local trips, the tracking seems very accurate, no issues there.  The volume is adequate, but could be better.  Using the FM transmitter worked well for me and had enough volume.  Background static was only objectionable when the volume was turned up loud.  Even better, I tried using a cassette adapter which worked very well and gave great sound.  However, most of the time I just used the internal voice and speakers and they were acceptable.The Voice Recognition (VR) is the hot feature for this unit and I found it to work very well.  Quite impressive, actually.  It required no ""training"" and had a high degree of accuracy.  It is the best VR I've seen yet on any portable device.  Good enough to actually be useful.  One prime example, I can use VR to ""Zoom In"" and ""Zoom Out"" (merely by saying those phrases) of the map while driving.  I also found it worked very well to find locations on the fly.  For example, you can say ""Find Nearest Mexican Restaurant"" and it will show a list, then you just pick (by saying the number) and ""Go!"" -- very handy!  For the current price, this feature alone is worth the price of admission.So far, the navigation and routing has been fine, but I need to do more testing.  Battery power is good (3-4 hours) and the ability to pop the unit out of the cradle and take with you to use on foot (think hiking, hunting, parks, large malls, etc.) and the  ""find my car"" feature are nice pluses.  The ""Where am I?"" is also a very easy and useful way to add locations to your favorites list.I'll come back and add more after I've had more time using the unit.  Some more comments and tips below.  [If you find this review useful, please click on the ""Was this review helpful to you?"" Yes (or No) below and feel free to leave a comment or ask a question.  I'll do my best to answer those that I can. Thanks!]Comments:Found satellites and had good location within five minutes right out of the box in my family room.  Good receiver.Replaceable battery!  Can buy additional spares if needed (hiking, for example).VR works right off the bat - no ""training"" required.  Very accurate in my experience so far. (No VR system is perfect.)Free Voice Studio software allows you to record your own voice prompts!  I can see mischievous minds at work already. ;)Fast route calculations -- overall pretty snappy and accurateGood ""MyGarmin"" web site with lots of extras, FAQs and support info.Has jack for an external GPS antenna/receiver, though I doubt you'll ever need it.  Might be helpful in some trucks.On screen touch keyboard works well and is easy to use.Lets you easily create and save routes at home before your trip!  Some units I've had made this very difficult.  Very nice feature that is simple and easy to use.  Can save up to 10 Routes, each route can have multiple destinations and via points.  Shows you distance and time of travel for each route saved.  Very flexible.  The 855 will optimize routes so you visit destinations in the most efficient order.  Kudos, Garmin!Has on board HELPTips:-- Audio out/headphone jack provide an alternate way to get audio.  Can use external powered speakers, for example.  Many new cars have an audio in jack which will give better sound than via FM transmitter.  I tried using a cassette adapter (such as used to play mp3's via car radio) plugged into headphone/audio out jack and it worked very well.-- I tried various A/C USB chargers and all worked fine.  At first unit will go into ""PC connected"" mode, but if you wait 30 seconds or so, it will then switch to ""normal"" mode and you can use it as you normally would.  Will charge battery fine.  These chargers can be found for as little as $5 sometimes.-- You can press and hold battery icon to see more detailed information, such as per cent charged and even core temps. (Diagnostic display)-- I saw a tip somewhere online on how to adjust the internal mike gain to improve VR by decreasing the sensitivity to background noise.  Will update later on this,-- While at home, you can easily set/save the location in favorites as ""Home"" (Overcomes common problem of house number locations being a bit off, which affects all GPS units, by the way.)-- Amazon camera case (item No. ??? , insert link) fits this unit perfectly and has belt loop for easy carry. (Will update this info later.)-- Cancel VR button on remote works as ""back"" button on menus, too.-- Use 128 CBR mp3's (constant bit rate) for best results.-- Minimize background noises when using VR for best results.  (True with most VR gear.)-- After you do the map update, you still need to go to myGramin dashboard and check for the new software update.  Follow the instructions very carefully.  Takes awhile, but it works and will verify the update once done.-- You can fold a paper plate to make a bonnet to shield unit from sun (heat) ad make the display easier to read in bright sunlight (though I had no problems with this).  Heat may be causing some of the lockups others here have experienced.  (Punch holes and use rubber band to secure.)-  In cases where a city or street name can not be understood, use the 'spell' option in VR mode and spell the name.8/5/2010 Update:  Used this on a road trip this past weekend (200 miles) and it performed very well.  So I can verify a few more things:1)  Extremely fast recalculations if you deviate from the planned route.  So fast, you might not even notice it.  Fastest of any unit I have used.2)  Very fast satellite lock when you stop (i.e. turn off the car and GPS) and restart.  It will be ready before you are!3)  I used the VR extensively and it worked very, very well.  I had no problems even with the radio on (low) and some noise in the car.  Yes, a sharp or loud background noise might cause you to have to repeat a command now and then, but this actually happened only rarely.  Most of the time, it simply worked.  I have not seen any other GPS with VR this good and this complete (in terms of supported functions).  This was the most important feature for me and I am very pleased with it.  You can truly use this GPS hands free nearly all of the time.  And most importantly, *all* the functions you need while driving are supported. (Like zooming, accessing turn info, searching for POI's and so on.)4)  This trip was one I have taken many times, so I know the various routes pretty well.  I like to drive down one way and come back a different way.  On the way back, it found a new, faster route on a tricky section.  At first, I thought it was misdirecting me, but when I checked and then followed the new route, it was indeed a bit shorter/faster than the way I normally go and on as good or better roads.5)  The estimated arrival times were right on the money.6)  I used the built-in speakers most of the time and they were loud enough for me.7)  Very easy to use, no problems or issues.  The only other GPS I've used this good cost twice as much. Excellent at the main job of getting you where you want to go. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(8465, 8479)"
B000PDR230,electronics,What port do you prefer?,"I have bought FIVE (5) Garmin GPS units, one Nuvi for the car and 4 handheld. The hardware is fine, but as many here have indicated, the product is only fully realized with good software maps, which are purchased separately (from Garmin). Now I have not had good luck with my handheld GPS's: one stopped working, I lost 2 of them, and a fourth got run over by a car in New Zealand. Of course no one would expect a replacement for a lost device, so I bought new ones FROM GARMIN. But I then had also lost use of the maps that I purchased, and Garmin will not authorize you to use a map you previously purchased on a new device. As was told to me by a (friendly) phone rep, Garmin makes most of its money on software.Now there are people who will cheat by perhaps selling or giving away a device with software and then ask for free replacements. So it's understandable that Garmin guards against that. But they are totally rigid about this policy, and my experience shows that it's greed rather than a concern about cheaters that is involved. When my expensive Garmin unit got run over and damaged, I offered to send the damaged unit back as proof that no one else was using the software, and they still insisted that I had to buy new software for the new GARMIN GPS I had just bought as a replacement.I think a customer-friendly company (like Amazon) would make some good-faith exceptions, especially with a customer who had bought so many of its products (and repeated software purchases). You should know before buying a Garmin product that Garmin is not that kind of company. The latest map involved is one that is 5 years old, not all that valuable, but still Garmin would not replace it. And the one that is on this device (the one that comes free with the Venture HC) is, as other reviewers note, not very good, so if you buy this product, you will probably also want to buy some good maps to go with it. Just know what the Garmin policy is about this and what kind of company mentality is involved. Don't think, for instance, that if you pay for the maps and then just decide to upgrade to a better device and want to send in the old one to Garmin to show you aren't using the maps on two device that you will not have to pay again for the software. You will have to pay, whatever the reason that you are not using it on the original device--because that's how Garmin makes more money. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2392, 2406)"
B003UE52ME,electronics,What do you think of the artistic design?,"I ordered this product on Jan 2, 2012 from Amazon. My first impressions upon taking it out of the box were that it looked different than the pictures shown. After comparing it to the product pictures I confirmed that what I ordered was a slightly different unit than what is shown. I have posted a picture so that you can see what is different in the one I ordered compared to the original product picture & the pictures of other owners. Specifically: The USB dongle is full size, not a mini like in others pictured. The buttons below the touch pad are completely different than other pictured models. Keys are also flat & clear glossy finger print magnet plastic material, not convex matte finish like seen in other models pictured.After trying this product out for a little over 20 mins navigating the internet and doing some video playback my first impressions are that I should have invested in another (but full size) keyboard. The biggest problem I have with this product is that it will go into some sort of sleep mode (I assume to conserve battery life) which takes about 10 seconds before it will reconnect with the computer and start showing the mouse swipes & keyboard inputs. This was very frustrating while surfing the net & watching YouTube videos. I have no idea the length of time before it would power down the signal but just to give you an idea this would happen after watching a 2 min YouTube video.At first I thought it was neat how small the keyboard was but after trying to type on it I've grown frustrated with typing on the thing. Having been raised knowing how to type on the keyboard I find myself being frustrated going from 70+ wpm on the computer down to about 10 wpm because of design of this particular keyboard. The keys are grid shaped, not offset like a normal keyboard and because of the touch pad on the right it's not as easy to type on as say an Iphone because you'r right thumb has to reach considerably further to hit any of the keys. So if you're thinking that you text fast & this wouldn't be a problem consider the inch of dead space between your thumb & the keys.Lastly, & probably the most important is signal quality. I purchased this with intentions of using it for an HTPC. Sitting about 10 ft away from the computer I found that it drops keystrokes about every 5th input. The trackpad is also something highly left to be desired. I first used this on my gaming machine that I sit about 2 ft away from and noticed a slight laggy input when using the trackpad. I was a little leery that the signal was that bad sitting so close to the input but I decided to still give it a chance and plugged it into my HTPC. Increasing the distance between the USB dongle & the keyboard only increases the lag of using the trackpad.So in review: 1 star was taken off for not receiving exactly what I was shown in the product pictures. 1 star was taken off for the poor signal quality of this item even at close ranges, and 1 star is taken off for the lack of distance this allows you to have between the PC and the keyboard (in the product description it states this works within 30M which I assume they mean 30 meters. Unfortunately in a 12x12 room with nothing between me and the PC I was having signals cut out constantly. This room also has no wireless internet connection & no wireless phones).

B00007E7JU,electronics,Was prompt the delivery?,"This lens is what truly got me obsessed with photography.  Having a prime lens (one that does not zoom in or out) forces you as the photographer to be the zoom and to move your body to the best possible position for the shot.  This makes you think so much more about your positioning during your shot and forces you to actually move around which is a huge positive.  Also, having a lens that has an aperture as wide open as 1.8 forces you to actually learn about aperture and when it is a good idea to shoot with it wide open at 1.8 and when it is a better idea to use a smaller aperture.  At first you'll be very tempted to shoot with it wide open, but I have found I more often shoot with this lens at 2.8 because the depth of field is more usable otherwise it's too easy to let's say have one eye in focus while the other eye is out of focus.Like many others I use this on a canon T3i with a 1.6 crop sensor which means this lens will actually be 80mm.  This makes it a very ideal lens for portrait photography but it can be a little tight for let's say street photography.  If the focal length is a little long I would suggest going with an 35mm prime instead.  This lens doesn't have as nice of a build quality as some of the more expensive canon lenses but the price is unbeatable and the image quality is unbelievable at this price point.  This is the lens that is on my camera 95% of the time and I recommend it to all of my photographer friends.  Please stop reading this review and order this lens, you won't regret it!

B009USAJCC,electronics,How would you rate the designs for the new house?,"So straight out of the box you get the Astro battery, a carrying case, a cable and 4 attachments for that cable. The 4 attachments are for different devices. Included in the box is a iPod/iPhone/iPad attachment(Not the new small one!), a micro USB attachment, a mini USB attachment, and a PSP attachment. These will come in handy when you do not have these device cables with you!The Anker Astro3E is a 10000mAh external battery for charging devices like your tablet or smartphone device. It has 2 USB ports for charging your devices and one micro USB slot for charging it. One USB is labeled Android the other one is labeled Apple respectively. Although I think their is no difference between the two USB ports. The Astro3E claims it can charge most smartphones 6 times before it dies out. When it does die out you can conveniently charge it with the included usb cable that has an interchangeable plug. This interchangeable plug can be swapped out with 3 other plugs that come with it. The device itself tells you how much power it has by the four led lights on the front of the battery. The less lights the less battery power. According to the manuel of the battery it takes about 8 hours to fully charge this battery. That is not that bad for what it outputs!Although you may have never heard of the Anker brand I highly recommend it. Their customer service is great and they make great and affordable products. In conclusion, this external battery is great for people who have no place to charge their mobile devices during the day or for people in need of power during an emergency.

B002RL875A,electronics,Which button we have to push to start the device?,"I replaced a Harmony 720 with the Harmony One. Since the 720 was not going to be used any longer, I used the replace remote button in the software. It transferred the account over to the Harmony One and loaded all the settings, Almost. It did not transfer any of the additional buttons I had defined for the previous remote or the ""favorite channels"" settings. This meant a fair amount of reprogramming.Other than that, I really like the new remote. It does everything well, the buttons feel good, and I like most of the layout. The touch screen, while very responsive, cannot be used by touch, like the older 720 screen could. On the 720 there were 3 buttons on each side of the screen, and this was much easier to do by touch.The range of the IR signal seems to be very good, and I don't have to point it directly at the Home theater setup, like I had to do with the 720.Overall I think the Harmony One is a great remote.

B000MXYD2Q,electronics,What are the delivery options?,"Overall, I am happy with the Regza 47HL167 that I purchased a couple of months ago. I read the 2008 Consumer Reports Regza review and agree with it for the most part. Overall, the TV can be an excellent value, and possesses picture capabilities that exceed several other more expensive brands. It has plenty of inputs for various devices and is easy to operate. It has a severely limited viewing angle that should be considered carefully by some potential buyers and that is the primary reason that I cannot give it a ""five star"" rating. I would probably recommend the Samsung LNT 4661 based upon reviews. It has ""as good"" or better picture quality and a better viewing angle. A comparable Sony will cost at least $400 more than the 47HL167 and you may not notice any difference in picture quality.The picture quality is very good with Standard Def DVD's, and excellent with high definition sources such as PC video files, satellite, over the air broadcasts, and Blu-ray discs. However, viewing angle may be an issue for purchasers who have seating too far to the side of the screen. Imagine the television at a 6 o'clock position. The picture is fine, if you are seated between the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions, but color begins to fade very noticeably when fanning out further. For those with a shallow viewing distance and wide room, I recommend that you steer clear of the 47HL167. The limited viewing angle is very noticeable to me and was cited by Consumer Reports. Imagine my surprise that hardly any Amazon reviews mention it.The colors are very vivid and the 47HL167 has numerous adjustments to help each viewer satisfy their own preference. I suspect that those who have encountered problems with ""Green or Blue Push"" have not adjusted the settings to their liking, or might possibly have defective sets. I have not noted any ""color issues"", though the 47HL167 does have setting modes labeled ""Cool, Medium, and Warm"" which can render the overall color in the direction of blue or green. Motion blur hasn't been noticeable either. Sharpness is excellent. No blotchiness or muddled lines are present.The blacks are very good and I recommend that you ignore concerns about the black quality of LCD versus Plasma unless you are a very discerning viewer. Grey hued black-levels evident with old and/or cheap LCD screens is not a problem. The only greyness that I have noticed is during credits and pre-movie viewing screens with poor quality DVD recordings. During movie playback blacks are black. Partly due to the LCD technology, but also because of the matte screen coating on this particular model, inky black levels of the highest quality plasma set is not obtainable. Other LCD models may have darker black rendering, but probably giving up the advantage of using the 47HL's matte screen. For most viewers, the difference is marginal enough, that it is only noticeable during side-by-side comparison to another model.Two strong characterstics of the LCD technology and the 47HL in particular should be considered. LCD offers a brighter colors and the matte screen option. Though, the Plasma TV offers a darker black, it is marred by the fact that the screen will reflect light from darker screen shots and appear dim in brightly lit rooms. In fact, the displays at the major retail stores illustrate this phenomenon very readily with multiple TV's broadcasting the same scene. The LCD TV's show little to no lighting glare or reflectivity, while the plasma will reveal the room distinctly in a mirror like fashion. The performance of the 47HL and its matte screen coating is excellent in brightly lit rooms and does not suffer from any mirroring effect. Fast moving action scenes are rendered without flaw. No dead pixels have been observed. The screen is easy to clean.Aside from picture viewing considerations, I can't find reason for complaint. Sound quality is fine, and no abberation (like buzzing cabinet resonance) is apparent. Bass and Treble can be adjusted and the unit also has three separate adjustments for Surround Effects. For movies I turn to my AV Stereo system to provide sound, but for TV broadcasts I find the TV speakers suitable. Three  hdmi inputs are adequate, if not using an AV Receiver to handle connectivity/switching chores. The 47HL167's remote control works fine for me, despite lack of back-lighting. I was able to add codes to control the disc players and satellite receiver, but couldn't get the much loved ""commercial skip"" functionality when watching shows recorded on Dish DVR.The TV includes the noteworthy three HDMI inputs, but has plenty of other connectivity options for non-hdmi equipped components: PC, DVD, cable box and antenna. You should be able to avoid using the composite or S-video inputs which result in much lower video quality. I observed very poor quality with S-video connections to a PC, DVD player, and Satellite DVR. For those computer owners who plan to use DVI adapters, beware that you may lose access to other HDMI inputs, if using an adapter on the TV side of the connection. The HDMI inputs are close together and the width of the DVI male connector and corresponding adapter will block the adjacent HDMI input(s). I recommend spending a few extra dollars and use a cable that transitions from a DVI connector on one end to HDMI on the other.The 47HL167 is very comparable in price to similar models offered by competing brands. Though you'll see it listed as high as $2,100, it is usually priced around $1,800 retai, and there have been several special sales on this TV (the lowest sales offering at $1,299).Also note that the 47HL167 will need about 15 seconds to power up, if in the power saving mode. I have encountered trouble when switching to my DVR before the TV is fully powered up. Switching to the input too quickly sometimes brings up a blank screen and a loud pop is emitted from the speakers, when trying to switch between inputs to correct the problem. At this point you'll have to shut off the TV. An alternative is to put the TV on a power mode setting that starts it more quickly, but prepare for a higher electric bill, since the TV will be using power continuously. I suspect that the issue may be caused by the DVR since the problem is absent when selecting other devices.In summary, I highly recommend the Toshiba Regza for those that view the TV from within the limited viewing angle and plan to watch DVD's and High Definition content. If low price is priority, the Olevia and Vizio are fairly competitive. If picture quality is most important, but at a cost under $1,800, then Samsung may be the better choice. Only highly discerning viewers will enjoy the benefits of a costlier LCD model or want to address the problems with plasma technology. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6755, 6769)"
B0049YQVHE,electronics,How are have multiple devices trying ?,"I have the luxury of working from home and I need a fast, reliable wireless router with good wireless coverage. My old D-Link DIR-615 was fast enough but I was never really happy with the wireless coverage. We have a 2 story home and as long as you were on the same floor, you were OK, but the other floor was spotty at best.The other problem I had with the old router was the limited number of concurrent connections it supported. As the number of wireless devices increased in the house (smart phones, iPods, several laptops, an E-reader, the Wii... you get the picture) I started getting complaints about dropped connections and/or the router being frozen.After researching what was available and working well for others, I settled on the Asus RT-N56U. The Asus has all the features I need such as high concurrent connection limits and extended range in the 2.4 GHz band (the band I use with my work laptop).So far, I couldn't be happier. The unit was easy to setup and plugged into my home network (wired and wireless) with zero issues. My work laptop now gets 5 bar - excellent coverage on both floors of my home and we have no issues with dropped connections or router hangs.We have connected the following wireless devices to the Asus with no issues:- iPhone 4s- Motorola Atrix- Blackberry Bold- iPod touch- Epson Workforce635- MacBook Pro (uses the 5 Ghz band)- Dell laptops (Win xp and Win 7)- Nook color- Wii- Samsung Blu-ray- Asus TF300 Tablet- Nokia Lumina 900- iPhone 5- iPad miniThe unit came with an older firmware, but it was painless to upgrade to the latest. I simply downloaded the latest firmware from Asus to a PC and then upgraded the router via the admin web interface.My only complaint is the bandwidth graphs don't show traffic by device. Instead, you can see the traffic by total, wired, 2.4 GHz wireless and 5 GHz wireless.One final note. I use the Cisco VPN client on my laptop to connect to the office  and it has worked flawlessly since day 1. No changes required to the client, work or the router.Update 6/11/12Just a quick update to add a couple of new devices that work flawlessly with the Asus router. We've added an Asus tablet and a Nokia phone to our stable of wireless devices. This router still rocks and delivers consistent performance despite the growing load.Update 6/22/13Another quick update to add/change devices. My wife replaced her Atrix with an iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. She is using it on the 2.4 band. We also added an iPad mini to the mix so the kids will let me use my Asus tablet.

I have no idea why no one sets the interface up to show you the MAC when connecting to an AP (access point). [The MAC might be needed if your filtering clients on your wireless network by MAC address] I have to forgo setting the device up then find the MAC and backtrack to set the device up. Other than that it seems fine. I do notice that when in FreeTime app that when I move from one wireless network to another it doesn't pick up automatically, more on this later.The tablet is very responsive. I'm quite impressed. Everything is fluid and gives me a good feeling about using it. I don't feel like I'm waiting on the device to catch up with my movements.Freetime and Freetime Unlimited are the reasons I went with the Kindle Fire HD, that and the ability to access the children videos for my kids in my Amazon acct.The Freetime app is nice. Its simply clean. You set a password on the app and then at launch the app simply gives access to only which Apps, Videos and Books you choose. No browser although you can start a search and hit the Amazon page. There is no option for Music which makes both sense and no sense. It would be REALLY nice to see a Music option also and to allow the option to allow music by artist, album, song, etc just like you can sort with the amazon music store/player.Freetime Unlimited is a good start at something great. This is supposed to allow access to a slew of apps, videos and books geared towards children so as a parent we will feel safe with them accessing anything on the tablet (Freetime). Most of the content seems to be age appropriate but there were titles in the apps, games and videos I didn't want my children to access. My wife, who has a Masters Degree in Reading (I wont go on about her list of credentials but simply I am VERY proud of her) said some of the content wasn't age appropriate and/or had no educational value for the children. Keep in mind though, this is a new feature and it will most likely get better from here. I would like to see Music added though. I would like to be able to add music content by album, artist, song title, etc from my library. It would be nice to see content added along with the Unlimited plan like Imagination Movers, Fresh Beat Band, etc. that the kids could just play on their own. One thing that I have not been able to do is to delete content included in Unlimited, or at least disable it from being seen. This would be a work around (not a solution) for the content we don't want our children to be exposed to.This is something extra for Amazon to read. If we put in our children's ages I really think the content should be geared towards that age group. Its nice to have some fun material too but if a child is given this device as a pacifier then wouldn't it be nice for them to be able to actually practice things they should be working on in their age group? My wife would be a great addition to your team to help you determine what titles are age appropriate, its what she does for a living :-)About the wireless in Freetime. It seems to have a hard time moving from one network to another sometimes. I think it should connect flawlessly just like a regular tablet does or maybe its just how the Kindle Fire series handles moving from one network to another. Sometimes it says it needs to login and it brings up the Amazon site. It would be REALLY nice if this could be scripted to to be done in the background for Freetime so trusted networks will automatically connect without user (children) interaction.I ordered the ""power block"", a HDMI cable, an Amazon Basics bag for the kids to keep their tablets in and the Marware case (it was a hard choice between the Amazon case but this one was a bit cheaper although has less features). They love them, I strongly suggest getting the Amazon Basics bag. I installed Zagg's standard shield (i hear the HD shields are thinner and not as good). The shields look great and you cant tell they are there when your looking at them. I install these shields on everything, even on gorilla glass devices. It gives a good feel, less mess from oily fingers in my opinion and you don't cringe everything the device rubs across a scratchy surface. Well worth the money.Bottom line is the Kindle Fire HD 7"" is a great purchase for my children. It has been a bit of an expensive but a worthwhile investment. The Freetime Unlimited app has proven to be a great investment also. If you don't see the books, games, videos you want your child to have then you can simply purchase the content and give them access to it on a per item basis. I ordered a camera app for them to play with it, they love to record themselves making funny faces and noises. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4981, 4995)"

True, the current ""in stores"" model does not have the nice hinged buttons of this one, but a portable mouse is always going to get a beating and should be either armor plated or disposably inexpensive as a consequence. I define this as about $20.All of the above In My Opinion, of course.[/EDIT][EDIT 3/19/14] The USB receiver went out on the replacement mouse after about 11 months usage. The price on these units has risen to the point I can't afford them any more so I bought a 325 to replace it. The 325 is almost identical in use (if not in look) but for the clickless mouse wheel, which I hate. YMMV. [/EDIT] ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1955, 1969)"
B008DWH00K,electronics,How are both sides with respect to the angle?,"When the Asus PA248Q 24 inch LED IPS monitor arrived overnight on my doorstep (You have to love Amazon Prime) I recieved a much better monitor than expected.  The monitor is packaged very well and arrived as expected.  There are good reviews on it.  Let me add a few things that I never saw listed.This is my fifth IPS monitor purchased in the last eight years.  I don't waste my time on TN glass.  Several things led me to the purchase of the Asus monitor: Overall good reviews, no coating smudges and the color gamut, and the USB 3.0 ports.  I considered the PA246Q monitor for a few more dollars but chose this one for the USB ports.It worked perfectly out of the box and the first noticable difference was the color.  It is incredible and it puts the colors on my old Gateway FPD2485W monitor to shame.  They run next to each other, the Gateway turned up for vertical use.  The Asus also runs much cooler - warm to the touch and nothing close to the Gateway furnace.  I suspect that it the LED that makes the difference.It had some unexpected surprises.  First, the bezel surrounding the screen is smaller.  The stand is well built and very sturdy. The monitor cannot wiggle around.  You can read about the ports.  And it has the picture-in-picture feature of the Asus 246Q monitor; somethingthat is not listed in Amazon's description of the product.  Better yet, I plugged in my USB 3.0 portable hard drive; it powered up easily and my computer quickly recognized it.  I used it all day with no problems.  I had not expected that.Setup is easy.  The colors are accurate.  I love the 5-way rocker switch.  I love the different adjustments it allows.  I suppose if there is a downside it would be that it is extremely bright even at the lowest settings.  But my aging eyes see it well and I am getting used to it.  White leans toward the blue part of the spectrum (LED again) but changing colors does not affect the white color or the black.  A black background on your screen seems ""shiny"" and deep compared to flatter monitors but it is easily covered with a dark grey or light black background.  The colors are so fantastic one might as well use photos instead.At 6ms refresh, there is no noticable ghosting in games.  That is pretty quick for an IPS monitor.  And again the colors make the game so much more immersive.Considering the fact that I spent over $600 on my last IPS monitor, I am going to buy another one and run them side by side.  My only disappointment was that Amazon lowered the price by $45 the day after it arrived.  Talk about bad luck.  Still, it is a great deal.  My advise:  Buy it.My last comment:  There were NO BAD PIXELS! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2655, 2669)"
B0044YU60M,electronics,How is the configuration?,"I purchased this router a couple months ago to replace my aging ZyXel X-550 Xtreme MIMO routher (which is still working fine for the most part).  I finally got around to installing it yesterday.  My initial impressions were not great, to be honest.  The build quality doesn't seem great - mostly lightweight plastic, and the unit is so small and light that the two cables coming out of the back keep the unit from sitting flat on the back of my computer armoire.  I'm OK with that as long as the unit proves to last a long time with few or no reboots needed. It is too early to tell, so I will try to update this review a few months down the road.My next issue with the router came immediately after I finished the setup.  Minutes before unplugging my ZyXel router, I had a reliable network connection on my desktop computer, which has a wired connection to the router.  Upon booting up the Medialink router, I had no network connection and could not even access the router directly through my browser.  I meticulously went through the setup instructions 3 more times, being careful to unplug everything in just the right order.  Still no luck.  I then tried a wireless connection and discovered that did work.  I was able to finish the router setup wirelessly.  I then tried a wired connection from my notebook, and that also worked.  So the router itself seemed to be working fine EXCEPT that I was unable to access it from my desktop, which is a critical need.  I contacted Medialink by email but did not hear back from them quickly so called them.  The initial tech was unable to help. An hour or two later, a level 2 tech called me back and was also unable to help, suggesting that it was a hardware or software issue on my computer.  I then spent 3 hours on the phone with a Dell tech, which was a huge waste of time.  I also submitted questions on a handful of forum sites.  At 11pm, after 14 hours of trying to get this router to work, I tried plugging in the old router, and within minutes I had a working connection again.  Frustrated, I gave up on the new router and went to bed.  This morning, I spent another couple hours doing some troubleshooting before contacting Medialink again by email.  After some time with no response, I called and was told that someone would call me back.  They didn't, but they did respond to my email.  With the new info I provided, they were able to suggest that I wirelessly access the router to change the default IP address from 192.168.0.1 to what my old router had been using (192.168.10.1), then reboot the router.  That worked!  If anyone runs into a similar issue, be sure to give this a shot.  You can change the default IP address by going to Advanced Settings --> LAN Settings on the router.I'm not a hardcore geek, but I'm comfortable with technical things so I was not real happy that I had to invest so much time getting the router to work, nor was I happy about how many emails & phone calls to/from Medialink I had to invest in to get it working.  And I was slightly disappointed in how Medialink came across in their support; I just didn't feel that they were eager & willing to go the distance in helping me resolve this.  HOWEVER, to their credit, they did respond in a reasonably timely fashion, and they did eventually come through with the solution I needed (albeit because I was willing to invest the time & effort to narrow the issues down on my own, something others might not be able or willing to do).In hindsight, I would have gone with a router with a better reputation behind it that offered some additional features, better build quality, and tech support that is able to resolve issues more quickly.  However, for the price, this seems to be a decent router.  I am using 1 wired connection and several wireless devices, and the speed and reliability thus far seem great.  Others have obviously had great success with this, so as long as it continues to work well for me, I have no problems recommending it as a budget router. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4001, 4015)"

B0038W0K2K,electronics,How is the bass?,"I have two points to make for the sake of full disclosure before actually writing a review of these headphones. First off, I received a free pair of the M6P headphones in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I will do my best to deliver on my end of the bargain, with a review written for those wondering if they should spend their hard-earned money on the M6P. Secondly, I have never been an in-ear headphone person. I've used plenty of in-ear headphones in my day, but I have always preferred over-ear headsets as I find them to be, nine out of ten times, much more comfortable and high quality in their sound. That been said, I have been massively impressed by these headphones so far. Let's get to it then, shall we?As with any headphones, primary concern for me is sound. How does the M6P fare in that regard? Surprisingly well. I have never owned a pair of in-ear headphones that has had such a good sound range as these do. Usually, this sort of headset is severely lacking in bass and lower-mid tones, but the M6P has a genuinely fantastic range. Of course, the bass isn't quite what you'd get with over-ear phones, but honestly, it sounds pretty great. A little adjustment to equalization settings is all it takes for it to sound the way I like. Highs, mids, and lows are all  distinct and clear, with no one aspect overpowering the others. I've really enjoyed my time with the M6P so far. They also look pretty cool. I got the ""clear"" option, and it's got a nice clean science fiction look to it. I like it.The M6P has several features that are worth noting as well. The last three or so inches of cords that go into the headphones themselves are made of a much stiffer material than the rest of the cord is. This ""memory wire"" is there is so you can mold them around your ear, making these headphones perfect to use while exercising or working. I have a physical job that allows me to listen to music while working, and these headphones have been incredibly nice for that. They rarely jostle or fall out. If you're looking for a good set of headphones for use while working out, these are ones I'd give serious consideration. The M6P also has an inline universal control that has a surprisingly large variety of uses for only having a single button, a volume slider, and a built-in microphone. The volume slider is incredibly nice as you don't have to fight to get your iPod/Mp3 player out of your pocket to adjust the volume. Same goes for the single button, which can be use for playing/pausing music and even skipping or restarting tracks depending on how you press it. The mic works pretty well for phone calls too. Overall, the inline universal control is a pretty convenient feature I rather appreciated. It's a pretty high-end feature that I've never had on any in-ear headphones before.The M6P comes in an attractive little box with plenty of accessories in addition to the headphones themselves. There's a really small zip-up case that carries other things in addition to the headphones. There's a really nice folded up users manual that is very helpful in getting acquainted with the product and its various features. There's also a small zip-lock baggy with several different types of rubbery ear tips you can switch out if the default ear-tips don't suit your fancy. I really appreciated the extra ear-tips, as each of the six pairs pretty much guarantees that, no matter what your ears are shaped like, you will be able to enjoy these headphones comfortably. That's great. There's also a little clip that can be used to attach the phones into your shirt or whatever, which is a nice feature that helps keep the pressure off your ears if the cord gets tugged a bit. Overall, a nice package.Truly, these are great headphones, but they're not without some quirks to consider. The memory wire, as great as it is for keeping the phones in your ears, makes it so the headphones take longer to put in than others would be. Once you put the earbuds in your ears, you'll want to make sure you won't need to take them out for a little while. I also found the memory wire a pain to struggle with right out of the box until they had broken in. The memory wire on the right-earbud on mine were particularly stubborn for a little while. Once broken in, however, the memory wire is very easy to make conform to your ears and wroks great. Finally, and this is admittedly a nitpicky gripe, I don't care for the plug-in jack myself. It is angled at 90', with an L-shape. I prefer straight plug-ins for headphones, but that's just my preference, and doesn't really take the quality of the phones down at all. None of these are issues that would keep me away from the M6P, mind you, but they are quirks to keep in mind.All things considered, these are fantastic headphones. I've been supremely surprised by their high quality in comparison to all the other in-ear headphones I've owned. I have friends with high-end in-ear headsets that were twice the price (or higher) as these, but in my opinion, the M6P is much higher quality in terms of sound and has a much more robust feature set. These are a pretty awesome deal at $40! It appears you can get them for even cheaper than that on Amazon too, which astounds me. I'd definitely give these a hearty recommendation at this price. They're a great set of headphones. I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading. Toodles. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5395, 5409)"

B00009XVCZ,electronics,How is the focus?,"Is the Canon 50mm 1.2 L Series worth $1000 more than the 50mm 1.4? Final conclusion was: No, it is not worth it for me. But it might be for you. Here's why and how I came to my conclusion. I have also included some photos I took with the 7D and the 1.4 lens.I have been able to work with the 1.2 before, and was ready to buy my own. Buying the 1.2 was quite a leap, but I knew it would do the job. I researched the 1.4 hoping it could be just as good but for a lot less. What helped me come to my final decision to purchase the 1.4 was a website by Jim Arnold - [...] It has examples of the same shots using both lenses! I was worried that I would want the 0.2 difference in the lens, and I would miss it with the 1.4. But I must say that is not the case at all! This site has a ton of examples using the different lenses. He includes photos taken at f1.2, f1.4, and f2.8Bokeh on the 1.4 - One of the photos I added shows the bokeh of the 1.4. The 1.4 has 8, the 1.8 has 5. The 1.2 has also has 8 blades but produces a little bit smoother bokeh. But when I tested the bokeh on the 1.4 I was not disappointed. The difference was not all that obvious.Why not the f1.8 lens? I would say it's a great starter lens - so if that is what you want then go for it! But I have had friends who have owned this lens to only have it completely fall apart after only 1 year. The 1.8 AF is loud and slow. The 1.4 has a much sturdier build than the 1.8 with better auto focus and less noisy. From experience I would say that the 1.4 can even focus better in low light than the 1.2.The 1.4 is lighter than the 1.2 and feels better on the camera in my opinion - weight feels more evenly dispersed.For shooting video with 1.4 - it focuses better in low light than the 1.2, making shooting a low light scene easier. The 1.4 makes for some pretty footage.1.2L cons - size, weight, high price - And not all that different from the 1.4.1.2L pros - beautiful bokeh, sharpest of these 3 lenes, well made1.4 cons - bokeh not as good as 1.2, but better than 1.8. A little less sharp (but I haven't noticed that personally)1.4 pros - good price, quality, not too different than the 1.2 in picture quality1.8 cons - plastic build, slow and noisy AF, choppy bokeh with 5 blades over 8 in the 1.2 and 1.41.8 pros - great price, great starter lensI enjoy my 1.4 lens VERY much and I am glad I chose it over the 1.2. You need to decide what is important to you when picking a lens. In my case the $1000 price difference just did not make the 1.2 worth it. The 1.4 is a very professional lens and one I will be using a lot. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2590, 2604)"

B002SGATH8,electronics,How a heating problem can be solved in a notebook computer?,"I have a 14"" Dell Latitude E5420 w/Core i7.When running CPU intensive processes, the laptop used to get very hot and you could hear the poor little fan struggling to keep things cool. In fact, once while playing NFS: Hot Pursuit (The newest one) the laptop actually went into thermal protection because the CPU crossed 100 degrees (Celsius).On idle, without the fans, it holds steady between 55 and 60 degrees.With fans I'm usually between 38 and 46.So we can easily say this is more than a 20% decrease in heat. And as we know with electronics, the cooler it is, the more efficient it works.I placed one fan directly under the CPU and the other under the RAM.These fans are extremely quiet, so you'll actually forget that they're on!I also disagree with the person that stated that this item cannot be used on one's lap due to the open back design. The fans come covered. And even then, the pad is at an angle so they don't even touch my legs if I'm on the bed. Also, if it's hot, using the laptop on your lap actually helps to keep your legs a bit cooler as well!Be very careful with the fans as you dismount and remount as the clips that hold them in place do seem to be rather cheaply made and will probably break very easily.Also, be gentle with the USB power plug. It also seems to be cheaply made and may break with too rough a use.All in all I have already recommended this product to a friend and would suggest it to anyone whose laptop gets to hot to stay on your leg.I also recommend this highly over the other coolers that have one big central fan. The fact that these fans are removable, you can position them exactly where the problem is.One big central fan with a fancy blue light is pretty... but this one is just purely efficient!Since I've had this item, the hottest I've been able to achieve was 83 degrees.

I already have an Amazon Prime membership, mostly for quicker shipments.  But of course, with Prime, you also get a lot of free movies.Now, I'm not saying that the movies from THIS service are necessarily better than the movies from than THAT service -- there are probably more films available right now from THAT service for sure -- but, it is getting close enough that it was time to stop paying the seven bucks a month.But there was another issue.  I have a streaming box from, well, you know who.  Now, I really like their devices.  I have a phone, a tablet, and a streaming box from them (similar to Roku).  But they don't let you install apps on that device, and there is no pre-built app for Amazon's streaming service.  So, that required me to buy a new Roku box, which comes preloaded with an Amazon streaming app.  (No no.  Jailbreaking, even if it would work, is a horrific idea from a security standpoint.)I almost made the mistake of ordering the ""wrong"" Roku box from Amazon.  When I initially looked at the quick spec list, I was disappointed since it didn't appear to me that any of them had both wireless and wired Internet capabilities.  But luckily, I stuck with it and realized that the most expensive box was the ONLY one that had ethernet.  This is important to me because, while I have a wireless network, it is of course almost always better to connect your devices through wires, particularly through Gigabit ethernet, which I have throughout my house.The setup was relatively easy, although the hardest part:  getting the batteries in the remote!  The battery relase button must be pushed down; I have to say that I think that this is the first time I've ever seen this.  After that, it was just some quick registration with a couple of web sites to enable movie playback.First movie:  ""Marnie.""  Now, I reviewed that film on this site, and while I didn't completely like it (you may read my review to see why), the digital transfer was fantastic.

The apple ipad cover fell completely short of being something that holds the IPAD in a position that i'm comfortable with.  I like it raised slightly higher--gives better viewing and better ability to use the keyboard.Even the apple store guy said he did not like the limitations  of the ipad cover and recommended a leather cover alternative.I don't know how this will hold up in a year--but to me, the price was cheap enough that it doesn't matter if it falls apart in a year.  It seems like it will be durable though.While some might be comfortable using this cover while the IPAD is standing, I only like to use it in landscape mode.  It seems too unstable standing.You can not use the cover while docking the IPAD in a docking station, however, you can hook it up to the computer or charger without a docking station.I am happily returning the $40 apple IPAD cover and keeping this.  And strongly urging you to not hesitate to buy this.There is an elastic strap on the top corner, inside the cover, to keep the IPAD in place.  The snap that holds the cover closed, remains loose when the cover is open.  That bothers me slightly--just because i don't like the look of it that way.  The  Kick stand (for lack of a better word) is magnetized with what seems to be a sufficient enough magnet to hold it in place when you don't need to use it.With all of that said--I wouldn't pay $70 for this--then again, i can't imagine paying $70 for any IPAD cover.

B000CS7U1C,electronics,Which button we have to push to start the device?,"dang! i had written this HUGE review, submitted it, and somehow, it got lost. ;( this is probably for the best since i've now had the creative zen vision:m (ZVM) for awhile longer and i can write a more objective review.anywho...i finally decided i wanted a hd-based mp3 player after having my trusty little rio S10 (512mb) for a few years. of course i was aware of the iPod, but in looking around, i came across the ZVM. i knew all kinds of people who owned iPods, but knew no one who owned a zen. since i'm a bit of a gadget girl, there were some things i needed to know before making my purchase. i grilled an iPod owner and got the answers i needed and then joined a forum and grilled a bunch of ZVM owners. it was quickly apparent that the ZVM was the device for me. i had planned on buying one right after xmas, but my mom surprised me with the blue one on x-mas day!i've loved the ZVM since day one. it's nice and sturdy and the blue one is a neat color. i'm rare in the fact that i think they look way better than the iPod. the iPod is starting to look kinda dated and the ZVM stole my heart as soon as i saw it. navigation is easy and the screen is so clear and bright.it's hard to write a review of an mp3 player without comparing it to the iPod. everyone and their brother has an iPod and so many people think there's nothing else out there. well, i'm here to say there ARE other things out there and (gasp!) they're better! i've been so impressed with the feature set of the ZVM and how awesome it's been to use.a few people have complained about the touch pad, but if you lower the sensitivity, you'll get used to it. it took me about a day and then i was 100% comfortable with it and how it worked. it can be a little sensitive at times, but it's not much different than apple's scrollwheel thingie. just moves up and down instead of in circle. also, the buttons are sturdy and press well. a very solid device all around.the biggest and really only downside to the ZVM is it's software. it's not just bad, it's really bad. there are a bazillion applications and none of them are bundled together. you'd think creative would integrate all the little programs into one, but they don't. and many times, it's hard figuring out which software to use for what function. iTunes really does have creative beat in this area. however, there are some great alternatives to creative's software: mediamonkey and windows media player 11. however, you'll probably still need to use the creative software for things like transferring images.how the ZVM is better:* cheaper (although the price jumps around a bit).* fm radio and the ability to record it.* screen is amazing. more saturated and more pixels.* more selection of colors for the 30GB model (pink, blue, green, black, white).* works with all music stores, whereas iPod only works with one (iTunes).how the iPod is better:* far more accessories for the iPod. there aren't many fun ones for the ZVM.* iTunes is far and away better software than the junk the ZVM ships with.pros:* awesome screen. bright, clear, crisp, saturated.* sound is great when ripped at 192bps VBR* feels nice and solid in your hand.* great battery life.* the device is beautiful. solid.cons:* non-removable battery (same as iPod)* software! it really is horrible.* does not ship with wall charger.* integrated, non-removable battery (same as iPod 30GB).* included headphones are crap.advice:* get an extra dongle. huh huh, i said ""dongle"". they're only 10 bucks.* buy the wall charger. it charges at least 2X faster than the sync cable/charger.* if possible, use the line-out hole instead of the headphone jack for external playback in places like your car. it sounds way better.* join a forum (anythingbutipod dot com is a great one) - tons of helpful advice to be had.* if you're unhappy with the software, try mediamonkey, it's great. i've heard windows media player 10 and up work well, too.* get better earphones. the ones that come with are pretty crappy.* get a BSE (best skins ever). great protection against scratches and they're cheap. in fact, get two. you'll probably mess the first one up. :) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4136, 4150)"
B00829TIA4,electronics,What is the final performance?,"I originally planned to use this drive for backup of a MAC, but an emergency popped up in the PC world, and I put it to work.===The Good Stuff===* The drives comes with a USB2 to USB3 cable, and plugging it into my laptop immediately powered up the drive and started the download of a device driver.* The drive is pre-formatted for a Mac, so to use it on a PC you need to download an HFS driver from the Seagate website. The info is included in the quick-start guide. I found the driver with a minimum of hassle, it downloaded OK, and after a quick reboot, the drive was visible in the Windows explorer.* File transfer seems reasonably fast- I copied 1.4GB in about 1:40, for an average speed of about 14MB/S.* The drive is a nice form factor. It will just about fit in a shirt pocket-if you have oversized shirt pockets. It weigns about the same as my iPhone, so not real heavy or too hard to carry.===The Not-So-Good Stuff===*The drive only has a USB3.0 port, so you need a 2.0/3.0 cable. One is included, but a USB 2.0 port would have been nice in case you forget the cable.* The Seagate Dashboard software did not inspire confidence. The copy on the drive was corrupted, so I downloaded a fresh copy from the Seagate website. That worked OK, but I could never get the automated backup to work. According to the included manual, on the Home page of Seagate dashboard there is a ""protect"" button to start the backup process. I never got this button to show itself.* The other major selling point of the Dashboard is the ability to backup data/images from Facebook, Flicker and YouTube. I am not quite sure why I would want to do this, and my natural paranoia keeps me from giving Facebook any sort of access to anything having to do with my local drive. To its credit, the Dashboard software seems to allow disabling of this access. Still-just makes me nervous-I don't trust Facebook to be anywhere near my personal drive.* Installing the Dashboard software seemed to load a LOT of software-look like a whole Microsoft C++ distribution kit.  The uninstall seems to mostly work (it did throw an error for a file not found. Unfortunately it didn't seem to offer the option to uninstall all the Microsoft stuff in downloaded, and I am not sure where exactly it put it. Oh well, disk space is cheap enough.===Summary===The drive works great for PC bulk storage. It has a nice form factor, and the HFS driver seems well behaved. I reformatted the drive for NTFS with no problems.The Seagate Dashboard software doesn't inspire any confidence. I never could get a backup job to run, and the thought of Facebook being anywhere near my data is to scary to consider. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2659, 2673)"
B009A5204K,electronics,What is the sound quality?,"One may look at me strangely, friends may call it ""dorky"", others may mistake it for a hearing device, but now it is purely a part of me. Day 2 of purchasing this, I've already stopped feeling its weight on my neck. I find myself reaching out for the skip button or the volume button to control real life, sadly LG tone does not come equipped with those features. Maybe in the future.Anyway, this is pretty impressive. To my biggest surprise, the bass was better than any in-ear headphones I have purchased. (other than Beats Tour, but I felt like Beats was made purely for those that enjoy bass-heavy music) The sound quality is definitely not questionable.Above it all, Tone is extremely intuitive. It's extremely easy to use and the vibrating-notifications and SMS readings are just the cherry on top of the best guilty purchase ever.The only strange experience I have is when I have my phone/device connected in my pocket, and I put my hands in my pocket at the same time. The sound gets cut off erratically. I can tell that it's probably my hands blocking the device (like the grip of death for iphones several years ago) but all that is required is to transfer my phone into my purse.The preciseness of the range (33 feet) is quite creepy.

B009A5204K,electronics,What do you think of the artistic design?,"I've had the original Tone headphones (HBS-700) on my Wish List for some time and finally received them for Christmas this year. Let me tell you something: I had NO idea what I was missing! If I'd realized how great these headsets were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There are two additional, larger sets included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, after only a few days, I purchased this model, the Tone+ (HBS-730), but kept the HBS-700 model for my spouse. The Tone+ solves my only gripe with the standard model: the lack of a mute; a necessary feature for professional conference calls. The Tone+ also add several improvements including a vibration alert for incoming calls and best of all, the ability for the Tone+ to be actively paired with 2 devices simultaneously (be it 2 phones or a phone and a tablet, for example).I am simply stunned by the quality and features available for the Tone+ given the price. It's hard to find a quality set of wired headsets, or a single-ear headset for this price.In short, I am very impressed and am very happy with this product that I use daily.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Very good sound quality for the average user.+Impressive battery life.+Simultaneous active pairing to 2 devices+OUTSTANDING VALUE (hard to beat the price/quality even compared to a quality wired headset)NEUTRAL:=Noise-blocking earbuds. Great for focusing on a conversation or your media. However, less useful for use with a Playstation and dangerous if used while driving (I have a standard headset for these situations).=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds. However, there is almost never any tension on the earbud wires. But, given that I use them to sleep, I've purchased a 3-year replacement plan through Squaretrade for $10 (30% off) that even covers wear and tear.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Sound quality may not stack up for a true audiophile.-The Bluetooth connection can be tempermental. Even the human body, if place between the device and the headset (such as putting your phone in a back pocket) has the potential to interfere with the signal. This is personally a rare problem, but a surprising one when it occurs. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3475, 3489)"

I live in an apartment building and there is tons of WiFi floating around, most it on those channels. This can cause interference and disrupt service. I changed the channel to 11 which almost none of the other networks are operating on.The reason I took a star off was because of the power cable.

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,When was that video recorded?,"For reference, this is my setup:Time Warner Cable in Austin, Texas with gamer speed, on really old shared wiring that is so bad there isn't enough power to get actual cable--I just have cable internet; a MediaLink router; a four-year-old Korean re-branded Viore monitor without a working antenna, but with three HDMI ports; and, a two-year old basic Dell, factory setup laptop.Having said that:  my cable service, despite paying for ""gamer speed"", is pretty shoddy during peak hours.  HuluPlus and Amazon on Demand seem to have packet streaming that deals with that pretty well--I have to restart movies during peak hours, two or three times, but other than that I don't have much interruption.But, I thought this didn't work at all with a two-year-old Dell laptop because it couldn't connect during peak hours. (It wouldn't work at 10 p.m. on a Monday night). Then, my boyfriend got it to ""Cast"" using a Samsung phone at about 11:00 p.m.. We like to watch very old Led Zeppelin videos on YouTube, and it did work well for that. The video and audio with even really old footage is excellent.The next day, I had no problem at all getting it to cast at 1:00 a.m., from my laptop.  As of this writing, though, I don't think it works unless your cable is really good.If you have bad internet, this isn't worth the money.  The free Netflix is nice, though.

B0099SMFVQ,electronics,What is the easy key?,"This is one of those keyboards that you can immediately tell is top quality. Granted, Logitech has a history of making good keyboards that feel and work well even after years of prolonged use. In fact, despite occasional forays into other brands, I've always come back to them. It's gotten to the point where I'd pretty much consider myself brand-loyal.The downside to their products is they're usually more expensive than the competition. There aren't many choices for bluetooth keyboards with memory- the only other one I found was IOGear's Multi-link keyboard. That one looked technically superior in some respects, e.g. it has a trackpad and 6-device memory. It's also about half the price, and I'll admit I was (again) sorely tempted to jump the brand boat and check it out. However, I decided not to due to the fact that I'd probably use a bluetooth mouse anyway, and I don't plan on using this with any more than 3 devices anyhow. Plus, the Logitech K810 has some advantages of its own- namely that it's backlit, rechargeable, and can actually detect when your hands are on it for power management.The keyboard itself is both compact and slim, and is very attractive. It also feels great typing on it despite the fact that it's a compact keyboard. The keys are very quiet in general and the backlighting works well. It lasts a good amount of time on a charge (usually about 2 weeks if you use the backlight), and is rechargeable via micro USB. The keyboard layout is pretty standard, with 3 F keys serving the dual purpose of switching devices and the others to control various functions like backlight intensity and volume control. You switch to the regular F# functionality via a FN key.Switching devices is the big draw of this keyboard, and it works very well- practically instantaneously. The keyboard seems to have memory, so if you type while switching it will backlog the keystrokes. Pairing was also straightforward- there is a standard pairing button on the bottom, and after pushing it you select which device setting to use, then pair as usual. The keyboard also has a manual power switch if you're going to store it. Overall, it works very well in general.The keyboard does lay flat (and only flat) so in that respect it's very similar to Apple's bluetooth keyboards. The feel of this one is different from Apple's but very nice in general- it's comfortable to type on for long periods of time and doesn't take long to get used to. Build quality appears to be very solid- no clattering if you shake it, and although I wouldn't toss it around the room it does look capable of taking a few drops.I've used quite a few bluetooth keyboards over the years, including older Logitechs, cheap ones by Anker, and Apple's. This is definitely my favorite one so far. The switching function and backlighting make it pretty unique, and I would say it's worth the high price. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2882, 2896)"
B007P4VOWC,electronics,What is the user interface like?,"I have the New iPad (aka the iPad 3) and my mom has the Kindle Fire so I have used that as well.  I would have to say that overall the Galaxy Tab 2 has worked great.  I received it about three days ago and I really like it.  I like my iPad but I always thought it was a little too big.  I liked the size of the Fire but I felt that the operating system on it was too limited.  I decided the Galaxy Tab 2 7"" looked right for the price.  It's $50 more expensive than the Fire and $450 cheaper than my 64GB iPad 3.  The screen is not as clear or bright as the iPad 3 and the video quality isn't as good as the Kindle Fire but I would say that it is not too bad.  Don't expect excellent video quality because it's not but you can't expect all the bells and whistles of a high end tablet for only $250.  I like the android ice cream sandwich OS.  It looks nice on this device and it's a lot different than Amazon's version of android OS on the Kindle Fire.  The interface is fairly smooth and intuitive.  I haven't really had much delay when tapping on icons or sliding the screen.  It's not quite as smooth and sensitive as the iPad but let's face it, if you are interested in buying the Galaxy Tab 2 7"" it is probably for the price and you have ruled out the iPad for that reason or because maybe you have one already.  I think the camera isn't too bad considering the Kindle Fire doesn't even have one.  It is front and back.  There is 8GB of internal memory with an expandable slot for up to 32GB micro SD card.  That is a plus over the Fire.  I find it easy to put music and movies onto the micro SD card, then put the card in the Galaxy Tab and it very quickly loads all of it onto the device to play.  Easier than using the iTunes software if you ask me.  The speakers on the Galaxy Tab are not as clear and crisp or even as loud as the iPad 3 but it gets loud enough for my taste.  The sound is better and louder with headphones.  With headphones it sounds pretty good.  The Galaxy Tab 2 is more portable than the iPad because if you don't carry a bag of some sort to put it in you can still fit it in your front pocket.  You wont be able to put much else in that pocket and it sticks out but you certainly can't do that with the iPad.  As far as android play store, I am new to it.  I'm used to iTunes but there are many of the same apps available on the play store.  There is a Kindle app so you can still read your ebooks.  As far as I can tell there is no way to play Amazon VOD for Prime members or otherwise.  You also can't really sync your iTunes purchases to the Galaxy Tab 2 either.  There are work arounds that allow you to put iTunes movies and music on the Tab but if that is something that interests you, you can always look that up.  Surfing the web is easy and you can use firefox or opera if you want.  I have read some reviews that say surfing the web on this tablet is slow but I have no found that to be the case.  Web pages don't load quite as fast as the iPad but they load pretty quickly.  I also read reviews about how the wifi connection isn't as strong on this device as it is on other tablets.  That appears to be the case but it really hasn't resulted in slow internet speeds for me; and my internet provider doesn't provide me with very good upload and download speeds.  Overall for the price I would say this is a good tablet.  You can get a few cellphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note or the upcoming SIII for $200-$250 that are like this tablet but with better specs.  However, that is the price you pay if you have an upgrade available otherwise without an upgrade you will pay retail of $500-$550.  I think that even the Galaxy Note's 5.3"" screen is a bit too small for a tablet though.  The 7"" screen is just right for an extra-portable tablet.  I would recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7"".  You can wait until July when supposedly a 7"" Google Asus tablet will be released for $200.  It is supposed to have better specs.  Just FYI. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3964, 3978)"

B00752VKFA,electronics,What is the quality of the blacks of the screen?,"UPDATE - September 29, 2012So, it's been a few months since I wrote my initial review of the GT50 and I wanted to give another update.Overall, the set is working great. I have not gotten it professionally calibrated, I want to do that next month, but the picture still looks fantastic, both for 2D and 3D content (""The Avengers"" looks amazing!). Interestingly, I find myself using the THX-Cinema settings just as often, if not more often, than the custom settings I had generated using the various calibration discs. That may be more out of laziness than anything else, to be honest.A few things:1 - If you have a lamp or a window in your room that you think will reflect on the screen, be aware that the anti-glare coating will not cut it during the day. You'll need heavy drapes for the day and use a dimmer or just turn off the lamp at night.  It can be distracting.2 - My biggest frustration is that I am noticing some degree of line bleed, which I guess is a problem with plasmas in general -- I noticed it with my old Samsung but find myself noticing it a lot more with the GT50. I am very frustrated to have to report this to you all and I am going to see what I can do about it, if anything -- again, this is something that happens on all plasmas, apparently, I just wanted to make sure you all knew that I was finding it somewhat distracting.(Line bleeding is when a ""ghost"" version of another element on a screen actually appears on part of the screen where where it shouldn't  -- for example, a character's face might be in front of a window sill -- the ""ghost"" of the sill continues across the character's face.  There is some discussion of line bleed on the GT50 here:[...] )I am not going to change my star rating for my review based on what I am perceiving as a limitation of the technology (as opposed to the set) but it's something to keep in mind. I will be doing some research to see what, if anything, I can do to address the situation and let you know what happens.Finally, I have received a few email inquiring which kind of TV stand I have (in the pictures section). I got the stand in 2007 from IKEA -- sadly, I do not think they make it anymore. It's a pity, it's kind of a perfect TV stand.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter six years, it was time to replace my aging 42"" Samsung plasma (during which a circuit board died, which ended up requiring an all new screen to be installed--thank goodness I had the extended warranty).  At first, I went with the UN55D8000, which was a good looking set, granted, but just didn't have the picture quality I wanted, so I ended up returning that less than a week after it arrived.  Then I heard about the new Panasonic models coming out, and realized that the GT50 looked like a promising candidate.I have had the TV for less than a week, and there is no way I am returning this incredible plasma television.  I will share some initial thoughts (and have submitted photos as well), and will update my comments later as a kind of progress report.If you care about picture quality and don't feel like waiting for the VT, look no further.  This set has one of the best pictures out of the box I have ever seen, with deep, silky blacks and vibrant (not never overly so) colors. My ""go-to"" test for black levels is the first scene of Episode 9 of the first season of ""Game of Thrones,"" which takes place entirely in the shadows. Quite frankly, I didn't know blu-ray could look so good. The details in the bricks and the clothing, all illuminated by a flickering torch, were astounding. There was a real sense of depth and clarity, even with this very dark scene--incredible.  I dialed in my own settings using the Spears and Munsil disc, but the settings included in the THX- Cinema mode worked really well and are a great starting point.The color controls for this TV are very extensive, and I think a professional calibrator could really make this set sing. I will get a real calibration done in a month and let you know how it goes. Suffice to say, once I dialed in the proper brightness and contrast and turned pretty much everything else off (and making sure to turn the ""panel brightness"" to low)--the set was great.I watched ""Tron"" in 3D using the Oppo BDP-93, and was very impressed with the 3D and the clarity of the picture. I don't have a lot of 3D content, so I will make sure to add more comments once I see more films. The glasses, which are not cheap, are light and quite comfortable, though it's annoying you are supposed to charge them via the TV--when the TV is on.  It would be nice if they came with little carrying cases or bags, but no such luck.I have DirecTV and the 1080i picture looks fantastic, as does the AppleTV's 1080p. It is with Blu-ray, however, that this set really feels most at home. I cannot overstate how rich the contrast is; my wife continues to comment on how much she notices the better picture, which is a great sign!I have this plugged into my sound system, so I haven't even heard the speakers, really, so I can't comment on the sound quality.As I illustrate in the pictures, the HDMI ports are very close to the side of the cabinet, so if you have thicker HDMI cables, you really need to coax them, gently, down the side so they don't poke out behind the set. I have a set of Bluejeans cables, which work just fine, but my Better Cables HDMI is definitely very close to the edge.  Speaking of cables, while the set does come with a cable stay, there is only 1 (though there are four places to put it)--Panasonic really needs to included another.The bezel is very thin and the set is not that much thicker than the Samsung LCD I had just a few weeks ago. I really like how it looks in the room.  The screen swivels about 10 either direction, which is nice. It's also much lighter than I thought it would be; I was able to put the stand on and lift it into place by myself (though, clearly, you should have someone help you--I was just excited).This is a really great set. I haven't seen the ST50, but I can't help but feel that the extra 24,000 shades of grey really push this TV to a higher level of picture quality. I am extremely, extremely pleased so far, and I am looking forward to putting it through its paces--and will let you know how it goes!Update (4/11/12):I started playing with the Internet Apps last night and wanted to add a few notes:1 - Every time I press ""Viera Tools"" or ""Internet"" I am kind of shocked how fast the interface comes up. This is, by far, the fastest interface I have ever used, thanks to the dual processor.  It's so fast that you start to get the feeling that you might actually USE the Internet on this thing!2 - Panasonic does have a web browser (App Store:LifeStyle) but it's a pain to download (you have to enter in your credit card information even though the application is free); I just wish it was included. I am going to fill out my credentials on the vieracast website because it's kind of annoying to enter in the data using the remote.3 - The YouTube interface is actually pretty nice. The text is displayed larger than on the AppleTV  and you can sort by HD Content only, which the AppleTV does NOT let you do--so that's very cool.4 - I still need to check out Netflix, Hulu +, Vudu and other applications. The GT50 offers a very comprehensive assortment of online services and, like I said, it's very easy and intuitive to get to.Other things:1 - Clicking on Viera Tools brings up a toolbar on the lower part of the screen from which you can access various items:- 3D options- THX options - basically, switch from THX Cinema to THX Bright Room and one other THX mode. Pretty good for testing out your custom settings with the THX ones.- Viera Connect - pretty much the same as pressing the ""Internet"" button on the remote- Media Player- DLNA - wasn't applicable to my system- Viera Link - not really sure what the difference is between Viera Connect and Viera Link; I will check it out and update this post- Eco - adjusts the auto-brightness features- eHelp - access to the 208 page manual via a specialized interface2 - There IS an iOS app (and I would assume an Android App) that can take the place of the supplied remote control. Useful, I guess, for Harmony users who may need specialized controls from time to time.  This seemed to work well for the most part but I have some thoughts:- The app makes ridiculous sounds when using the remote. You can turn the sounds off.  Really silly.- The trackpad controls are the default screen, but you cannot control the TV with them. You need to swipe to another pane to get to the arrow keys to navigate the menus. This was confusing at first and then just kind of irritating, because you have to go to one page to call up ""Options"" then swipe to another page to interact with the options.- The reason why I gave up entering my credentials to get the web browser was because the keyboard on the iOS app was NOT sending text to the TV. This is clearly a bug, but once it is fixed, this will work like the AppleTV, where you can use your iOS device to type into the TV, which is obviously much better than using the remote. Lame it's not working for me, though.- There is an iPad specific app which I have looked at but I haven't used with the TV (I don't know if it consolidate the various panes, will update).So, I dunno how important these services and Internet features are to you. I really like my AppleTV, so I already have most of them, but am curious to see Vudu's video quality and check out how Dolby Digital Plus sounds--I hope it works the Toslink output.  I personally will be using my iPad or Phone to deal with Facebook, twitter, etc -- even though image retention and burn-in are much less likely to be a problem on modern plasmas, I don't really feel like tempting fate with having a static web browser interface on the screen while I am surfing the web.hope this update helps!4/15/23 Quick updateTried the 3D. Here's what I got:1 - 2D-3D conversion was nothing to write home about. I didn't know if it was working half the time. Maybe I did something wrong, but it just gave me a headache.2 - Straight up 3D is awesome. Watched beginning of Hugo and found it hard to press ""Stop"". If you are into the 3D, you MAY want to get the 55"" for a more immersive experience, but the 50"" was fantastic, regardless. I still think the glasses make your eyes get tired, but still--the depth is really great, and the sense of immersion with ""floaty-bits"" was really top notch, at least in ""Hugo"".  Look, 3D might look brighter on the LED/LCD set I had before, but there was a sense of depth here that I felt lacking in the Samsung I tried out.3 - I have a few ""THX"" Blu-rays. I watched them in ""THX Cinema"" mode and they looked awesome. Maybe THX is not necessarily just hype?4 - Demo'ed the streaming services. Vudu's HDX format is no joke--it looks incredible, close (from my viewing distance) to Blu-ray, totally. HOWEVER, I could not get Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 (which is supposed to sound GREAT) output from the Toslink output on the TV. I am pretty sure DD+ requires HDMI, so that explains it. Still, DD+ includes the DD 5.1 mix and that sounded great. I was really impressed with the Vudo service and I think I will use it. Amazon and Netflix both looked great as well.  I still like the AppleTV UI, but this ain't half bad.Note: I talked to someone on the Panasonic ""Raise the Bar"" tour and she acknowledged that the iOS remote control app had some issues (the Android one is supposed to work fine) and that my problem (the keyboard not working) was going to be fixed soon. It was kind of cool that she knew about that.Finally, I put up some new photos showing a few off-axis viewing examples, a bird's eye view of the swivel angle, and some shots showing Vudu and Amazon content.thanks-m ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(11786, 11800)"
B0052YFYFK,electronics,How is the version?,"My main use is on my bike.  I listen to podcasts while I'm riding.  This headset with it's snug silicone ear buds block out wind noise better than my other headset (Backbeat), but I can still hear traffic well enough.  The battery life is great, the around-the-neck design works fine, and the controls work well with my Android except for:... I'll 'pause' the audio for whatever reason and then restart it with 'play' (both on the headset) and every once in a while some other audio will start playing -- like instead of continuing the podcast, some other podcast or some song will start.  I'm guessing this is some setting in Android, but I don't really know, and when it happens I'll have to pull over and take the phone out and find right app and find the thing I was listening to again, and get that playing again.  I haven't figured out if the headset is sending sloppy button signals, or the phone is just timing out, or what's going on.  It happens maybe 1 out of 10 times.  The Backbeat has the same problem (actually, worse).My last headset had microphone noise suppression for calls (I think it had two mics and did waveform subtraction) and I could talk to people in full wind or street noise and they didn't even know I was outside.  This mic doesn't have that, and people on calls with me always complain about the wind noise, so I have to slow way down or stop and walk.This is still a fantastic headset, and at a great price ($45).  If they would add microphone noise suppression like my other one, I would happily pay double for this.  Aside from that, this is still a fantastic headset.One other thought: this headset has the plug-in (to the ear) ear buds that form an air-tight seal.  Around the office I prefer the Backbeats because they sit in the ear and don't make the air-tight seal, so I can hear the office noises and people better.

We enjoy all it has to offer so much that we plan to cut our cable TV provider out of the loop at the end of the month. With Roku's ability to stream from sources like Netflix and Hulu Plus, we have our fill of TV episodes, and there are plenty of movie sources too.In this market, none of the selections are perfect at this point. Some competitors don't offer Hulu Plus, some are difficult to use and setup, some come and go within a few weeks. And the Roku is no exception. It has a few issues too.We run into a few stutters and freezes every once in a while - including the Roku box crashing and resetting. This is probably the channels themselves, but it is still a pain.While the interface is clean and user friendly, it could probably use a facelift to speed it up. Instead of apps all being on one line, it would be nice if they were placed on rows. My channel list is growing. In addition, many apps would benefit from a keyboard capability on the remote. Fortunately, the iPhone apps can provide this capability in some cases. But having it built into the Roku and remote would be nice.The only major disappointing issue is the lack of streaming from DLNA or network shares. You can plug a USB drive in, but you can't just stream from a share on the same network. Why not? Seems that Roku would have taken all the begging from customers into consideration and added such a feature. Many of their competitors offer the feature. There are a few workarounds, but they are a pain in the rear to setup and don't work as well as they could.Hopefully the Roku firmware can and will be updated to accept more filetypes and to support the network drives. But there is no telling at this point.But with those issues noted, the Roku was still the best bet compared to the competitors. At least for us. Hulu Plus is a big draw since many of the shows we like are on it (and many of the competing products that have the ""extras""we want, don't offer Hulu PLus). The simplicity is a necessity. It's nice that the Roku uses very little power consumption. And the abundance of channels is great.In addition, the kids enjoy the game capabilities, but I don't think it will be replacing our game consoles any time soon.Overall, we are very pleased with the Roku and will be getting rid of our cable TV provider in favor of the streaming apps in the Roku device.

B005HMKKH4,electronics,Is a great portability?,"This external hard drive does what it is supposed to: write, store, and read back large quantities of data at high speed. It must also do so reliably for a period of years, but at this early stage I cannot vouch for that. Ease of installation is also essential; a mass storage device should be completely plug-and-play; and it is helpful for it to be preformatted--this one is formatted NTFS for Windows XP and above. These are all the qualities that I want in such a device, but this drive also provides a couple of bonuses: portability and backup software. Although I use the drive with a desktop, portability, i.e. small size and ability to be powered from a USB port, are nice to have anywhere; not having to have an extra cable with a transformer plug that takes up a lot of space on a power strip is a convenience to cheer.As to reliability over a period of years, I have only had my new drive for a week, so I cannot speak to that; however, I will try to make it a point to update this review should the drive fail prematurely (I expect about a five-year lifespan--knock on wood). Thus far, I have written 340 GB of data to it; and from it I have played back HD video (full-frame-rate, full-HD mpeg-type, not just Flash) without a hitch or a glitchAmong these reviews I noticed a lot of complaints about the backup software. They may very well true; and this is not to excuse WD; but I have to say that I have never met a backup program that I liked. Most, including some top-rated, have vital functions that simply don't work. I currently use Windows 7's own backup program; it isn't great--not much flexibility and control; but it's free, and it works (so far).My main motivation for writing this review is to try to provide a little help with installation, which should reassure prospective buyers disturbed by the experiences reported by some other customers. I said above that installing mass storage should be a simple matter of plugging it in, and under the right conditions that is all that this drive requires. But ""under the right conditions"" can be a big ""if""; and a variety of issues can plague the installation of this drive as a USB 3.0 device. In my case, I had never attached a USB 3.0 device to my system before; and I found that Windows would not recognize the device when plugged into a USB 3.0 port. As a search on ""WD Passport USB 3.0 Installation Problems"" reveals, there are several problems that can occur; and dealing with all those is not the purpose of this review; however, I simply want to do two things: (1) reassure you that this device does in fact come with a good USB 3.0 cable, and that it transfers data at a considerably higher speed over USB 3 as compared with USB 2; and (2) to warn the buyer that (s)he may require a driver update for his/her PC. Regarding the first point, I am getting better than 2.5 times the data transfer rate with USB 3.0 versus USB 2. Regarding the second, the updated driver required will most likely be the one associated with the USB hardware on the motherboard of your PC; if you have problems using your WD passport on a USB 3 port, but not on a USB 2 port, visit either your PC vendor's website, or that of the maker of the motherboard, and do a search on USB 3 drivers. WD also provides firmware updates for its drives; but in my case at least, the Passport's firmware was already up to date as received.While I am in the business of giving tips related to the purchase of an external HD, be aware that if you want a hassle-free installation you might want to avoid drives with over 2TB of capacity. I, and others, have had issues, especially with Windows Backup, with 3TB drives. It turns out that the solution is fairly simple: use the WD Quick Formatter tool (available on WD's website) *before* attempting to use the drive (reformatting will wipe out any data you've already put there). As long as you're willing to take that extra step, it's fine to get a 3TB drive; and I have had no further problems with a 3TB drive. To be clear, the drive I am reviewing here is a 2TB drive; but I just thought I'd throw in this extra tip for people who are reading these reviews and are still undecided about what size to get.

That's a good thing, the picture somehow makes the product look much bigger.The installation could not have been simpler.

B0035ERKYW,electronics,How was the quality?,"The Microsoft Mouse has come a long way since it's 1983 introduction. It was 1982 when the company decided that because no one had come up with a good way to use their Multi-Tool Word (later Microsoft Word) for MS-DOS and for Xenix, so in 1983, Microsoft created and shipped their first PC-compatible mouse, which was the beginning of Microsoft Hardware. Unlike most MS-DOS programs at the time, Word was designed to be used with a mouse, and putting it simply, it was a clunky device with a weighted ball mouse inside, and had a cord that plugged into the serial port of the PC. But for this user, it was an amazing device that made word processing far easier.In 1984, PC Magazine columnist John C. Dvorak stated the mouse as a reason the Macintosh would fail. That obviously didn't happen, and the rest is history.I bought thisMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessas a result of having two from another manufacturer that were having problems with the rubberized sides peeling off, and because the small 'glide pads' on the bottom had peeled off after using them for a few years. Had bought aLogitech Wireless Mouse M505for my MacBook Pro earlier this year as a replacement, and this new one from Microsoft was destined for use with my Windows 7 PC. Sometimes it's good to have products for comparison.Likes:+ Blue Track Technology; offers excellent tracking, very smooth+ Rubberized sides; provide a very comfortable grip+ On/Off switch; located on the base, saves battery life+ Excellent ergonomics; fits the hand quite nicely+ Behaves well with both Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.8.x+ Nano Transceiver; stores easily in base when being transported+ Scroll wheel has good sensitivity; smooth and stable+ Runs from one AA battery; included; Microsoft claims up to 8 months life+ Ambidextrous; works well with right or left hand operation+ Good packaging; comes in a cardboard box that's easy to openDislikes:- None so farOverview:I was curious how thisMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessmight be different from theMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 - Loch Ness Gray. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it all seems to be in the packaging. The one marked ""3500 for Business"" comes in an easy-to-open recyclable brown cardboard box, which is a plus point for this user... no clamshell packaging to deal with.This mouse is smooth and easy to set up... it's simple plug & play with either the PC or the Mac, and I've tested it with both. It's responsive, and though the scroll wheel has a slight ""bumpier"" feel than the Logitech M505, it's adjustments are easy to adjust within the Windows Control Panel. The Logitech has a greater life with batteries, but that's because it uses two AA batteries as opposed to one AA cell with the Microsoft product, so that's a wash.As far as sensitivity and accuracy go, both of these models appear to be about equal, and both can be customized to fit your needs from within the software settings. The Logitech M505 is slightly longer, and the Microsoft is almost identical in size and shape to a Logitech M305; both fit the hand quite well and have an excellent ergonomic feel. Only time will tell if the rubberized sides and feet will stay on longer than those on the Logitech M305. Looking back across the history of the various Microsoft (and other) mouse units that I've had over the years back to the days of those with wired interfaces, it's amazing how much the technology has progressed over the years.TheMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessfeels and works like a good, solid product, yet it would be hard for this user to recommend it above the Logitech M505. Though slightly different in size and shape, both have an excellent ergonomic feel. The Microsoft 3500 with its Loch Ness Gray finish does have a good, businesslike appearance as opposed to looking like a work of art, so if that matters to you, then it's a good choice.11/23/2012 ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3915, 3929)"

For the first time I pulled the batteries and put all my other remotes in the closet.  For about $160 you can't beat this remote.  Good button layout.  Buttons are large enough and well spaced so even larger hands should be fine.  The only tight spot is the directional pad with OK in the middle.  Need to be directly on the OK button to get it right but I have large fingers and have had trouble with remotes, phones etc forever.  Lights up as soon as you pick it up.  Activities buttons (macro) work perfectly everytime to turn on/off all the equipment you need.  Switching between Watch TV, Watch DVD/CD or Play XBox360 works perfectly everytime and the remote switches to all the essential controls you need.  Press Devices button and you get access to each individual units controls, so if you need to adjust color on your tv or turn up the sub woofer on your processor it is easily accessed. Nice functional touch screen.  Fits the hand nicely and isn't heavy or clumsy. There is a little rattle but it is the sensor that makes it light up when moved, this is a functional feature not a defect.  Buttons are solid and overall it feels well constructed.

I toss it on there for one or two hours every few days.  Other interesting points about his type of battery: You should not let it go completely uncharged, ever.  If going to store it for a prolonged period try to get it around 40% to 50% charged before storing.  No need to worry about letting it lose most or all of it's charge before recharging, that applies to ni-cad batteries. Replacement batteries are all over the internet ranging from $6 to $20, so I plan to check monthly and pick up a new one at any sign of swelling, although I bet overcharging is the main reason most people get swollen battery.

I need another bluetooth speaker for a second car, so I tried T505.Good: The sound of T505 is better than T325 (without using FM broadcasting). It's not louder, but the sound quality is better in mid- to high-frequency. T325 is more on low-frequency sound, which mixes into road and wind noises.Bad: After using T505 for a week I realized how much T325 has been improved on human interface from T305/T505. T325 has auto connect, big call button, and can speak names when a call arrives. T505 has stiff and small buttons, don't do auto connect, and can only speak telephone numbers. As for voice dialing, T505's sound is tiny; it's hard to hear to whom the phone is dialing to. Voice dialing is not very reliable on both T325 and T505, but with T325 I know to whom it's calling and can stop it if the calling name is wrong.FM broadcasting: Only T505 has this feature. The sound is pretty good. However, it searches for a free FM frequency whenever it powers on. That means the frequency always changes. For this reason, it's extremely troublesome to use this feature. I guess if I don't turn T505 off, it's less an issue. However, I don't like the idea of having a tiny FM broadcasting station working over my head all the time. :-)So I decided to return it, and probably will get another T325 or the roadster.

I use Airplay to send audio to an Airport Express, from which I use line-out to connect to a stereo. Previously I had a compact shelf stereo system, but the sound was very muddy and lacked articulation. Weak amp, high distortion.The Lepai Amplifier is a huge improvement over what I had before. I want to set it and forget it -- set the volume and shove it under a dresser -- and this unit is perfect for that. Low idle current is important, and this unit seems to stay very cool. (I'll measure the idle wattage later.)When I first plugged it in, there seemed to be a lot of strange digital-sounding distortion, especially on higher pitches. I took the amplifier apart to see what their circuit layout and component choices were, and then reassembled and reinstalled it. Now it sounds fine. I'm not sure if I jiggled something, or it just needed to break in, or if there was a grounding issue or what.Some downsides to the product are the cheap enclosure (but at least it's metal, not plastic.) Mine came with small threads of glue all over the underside. The knobs are smooth, but plastic feeling. Mine came with a power supply, but it says ""Vonage"" on it. They probably got a good deal on someone else's old stock. The datasheet for the Tripath amplifier chip in this unit suggests a supply voltage of 13.5V, but the included power supply is 12V 2A. Sometime later I'll hook up a DC bench power supply and see if I can hear a difference.The biggest downside is the insanely bright blue LED that illuminates when the unit is powered on. I have the thing shoved under a dresser, and it lights up the whole floor. I'm going to replace it with a dim red one (soldering required.)For the price, however, this can't be beat.

B008F4NL04,electronics,What receptivity does the touch screen have?,"I'm going to start by saying that I really don't get the people that complain about light bleed! So far, I have owned this tablet for only a week but I have owned previous tablets longer than that. I have to say that my Toshiba tablet had NO light bleed to speak of. The sound on that one wasn't real great though. It also had no LED flash for the rear camera. The TF300T is a nice tablet by ASUS but, still no flash for the rear camera and the ""stereo"" speakers are placed far to the right of the back of the tablet as is the same with the TF700T which I am now using. It, however, does have an LED flash, a very bright one I might add. The folks that said the flash wasn't very bright, I don't know whom you were trying to kid. Now, the sound on this tablet isn't as good and rich sounding as the speakers for the TF300T, even though the placement is the same...to the far right in the back. That bothers me a little but not enough to send it back yet.As far as that darn light bleed. Well, this one has one spot towards the bottom that is very noticeable and then a few areas towards the right of the screen that show up also. But you know what people, it is my experience that once that tablet is fully booted up and you have all the images on the screen and the auto brightness has adjusted itself to a mid level, the ""bleed"" is no longer noticeable. I don't understand the people that have huge complaints about it enough to say they returned their tablets because of it. The screen is very nice and very responsive. Even in IPS mode for outside viewing, I can barely tell of any light bleed and it surely isn't enough to project across my screen. If you are out in the bright sun with the IPS mode on and the bightness at full, the sun's rays still block out what you think one could detect as ""light bleed"" so again, I don't understand what all the fuss is about! It's still not bothering me enought to return the tablet. The one I really wanted actually was the Toshiba Excite but the reviews were much lower than this one. I still feel in some way I should've got the Toshiba instead (thus the 4 stars of this tablet). At least it places its ""stereo"" speakers as right and left side speakers and not just all the way on the right side. It also has an LED flash.I'm not really going to comment on what bloat software it comes with becaue I didn't feel it actually has all that much extra apps installed to worry about. I'm also not going to comment on how well it runs all that software. I have found that from tablet to tablet, they all pretty much do the same thing with just a little bit difference in the design. That part is just to each one's own preferance. I've done the system update to the newest android version. The tablet as a whole seems to function well. I would recommend it to my friends but I also would suggest that they might want to research more and and maybe check out the Toshiba Excite or other brands and come to their own conclusions.

News of the incident exploded on the internet, and a huge number of irate consumers inundated the Amazon website with negative reviews on the Medialink router..This is very troubling. In a free economy, products live or die by their usefulness, reliability, and value. An informed consumer decision to buy or not to buy is determined by previous user experiences with these qualities via the product reviews. When a company threatens ""to stack the market in its favor"" by misusing the legal system to suppress a critique of its wares, the firm violates the true essence of a competitive economic system - let the market decide.

B0088CJT4U,electronics,How is it number ?,"You have read about what the router can do. I am not going to regurgitate it all back to you again, instead I will go over what stood out and what I had problems with when using this router in my network.As far as what good things stood out the router has 3 external antennas that are detachable allowing you to upgrade the antennas if you want. I like having antenna options. There are dedicated wireless and power on / off switches on the rear of router allowing easy rebooting and absolute control over the wireless signal. I was able to achieve my rated download and upload speeds from my ISP. I did not have to reboot the router because it locked up. The router runs really cool to the touch. There are wall mount slots on the bottom of the router. overall things generally work like they should.As far as what bad things stood out to me the router has a shiny black finish making it a fingerprint and dust magnet. There are no rubber feet on the bottom and it has a tendency to slide around on my desk. I dislike the bright blue LEDs that are angled up on the front panel.  I only need to see what is up at a quick glance directly at the router. I don't need the router to be constantly attracting my attention even when I am not directly looking at it. I don't like the fact that I can't see all LAN and Wireless clients along with their MAC and IP Addresses listed on a page. The wireless signal strength is not as strong as that from my Netgear WNDR3700v1.  Placing my cell phone back in my bedroom in the same exact spot swapping the routers in the same spot on my desk and measuring the signal using Wi-Fi Analyzer I measured the following:TP-Link 2.4GHz -76 dBm and 5GHz -88dBm vs Netgear 2.4GHz -65 dBm and 5GHz -84dBm.So my older Netgear with internal antennas seemed to have a better signal between those spots. I also had this weird problem where I had a Seagate Wireless Plus drive connected to the router via wireless. When I would do file transfers from a wired PC on the network to the Seagate drive the other devices on the network (wired or wireless) would slow to a crawl. I haven't gotten to the bottom of what that problem was yet so it could be the drive or the router at this point. I will have to do further testing in the future.I did not have a problem setting up the router. I have been through a lot of routers in my time. If you are new to configuring a router you may need some help figuring out what does what. Each page has a help section to the right of it. It is nice that it is there but you sometimes get that problem with a not so smooth translation to English so you aren't quite sure what they mean. You can figure most things out but some things are tough because of the translation and limited info.Overall not the most impressive router in my eyes but it is OK. I have had to test routers before that just wouldn't function for any period of time, at least this one can perform its core functions while maybe not near the top of what I would hope for, at least it does it reliably. Remember too that routers are a moving target with firmware updates, some things might get better and some things might get worse in the future. If you can get one for the right price it might be worth a look to you if you are in the market for a router.Update: I removed a complaint about no guest wireless. As support pointed out to me in the comments a new firmware came out after I started using the router to review it. The new firmware has guest networks for wireless along with several other fixes and improvements. So as I said a moving target and things can get better.

You're TV should have several &#34;source&#34; connections (where the source program inters the TV).  The remote control should have a &#34;source&#34; selector.  If you don't go to the correct &#34;source&#34; input you will not see the Roku input.  READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT COME WITH THE ROKU.  The included instructions for mine were very easy to understand.Most programming received through the Roku is subscription based, or &#34;Pay Per View&#34;, with a couple of exceptions, like UTube.  I am a NetFlix subscriber so I just added &#34;ON-DEMAND&#34; services for a few extra dollars a month.Roku 3 has a very small remote control.  It's very easy, comes with ear buds to plug into the remote for private listening, and the remote works on Radio Frequencies instead of Infra-Red to communicate with the Roku.  This means that the remote does NOT have to have an unobstructed line-of-sight to the Roku.It sounds like, from what I've read, some of the earlier models are very good also.  So, if you are counting penny's you might consider them.  Some have different connection requirements/abilities.BOTTOM LINE: I would recommend this device to my friends.

B0081H8TRA,electronics,Dose this performance fine?,"UPDATE 2/12/2014I will no longer recommend this router. Only two firmware updates since the release and main issues are not addressed. I've upgraded to R7000 which has a lot more support.UPDATE 12/26/2013Recently purchased a few latest AC routers specifically Asus RT-AC68U, Linksys EA6900, Dlink DIR-868L, Netgear R7000 and ended up going back to R6300V2. None offered more range or performance of R6300V2 despite having external antennas. While most of these new high end routers had some additional features, some of them had really unstable firmware, especially RT-AC68U & EA6900.  Netgear R7000 is probably the best of the bunch and I would've kept it if I didn't have R6300V2 already. It doesn't really bring more range or performance either and it barely has any new features especially for average user, but at least Netgear has more interest in keeping it up to date with frequent firmware updates.UPDATE 7/30/2013Bought R6300v2 to see if there is any difference. V2 now comes with dual core processor 800Mhz, 256MB of RAM and USB 3.0, it is also twice as small and comes with smaller power supply. All nice upgrades, but did it translate into better performance? In short, yes. For regular users, they may not notice the difference, but if you have gazillion of gadgets that use WiFi especially HD streaming you will be pleased that it offers better performance. I don't have any hard numbers to back this up, but overall this upgrade is totally worth it for my busy wifi network.UPDATE 6/27/2013My R6300 is now over a year old and it actually performs better then it did when it was initially released thanks to several firmware updates. I've tried latest AC offerings from Dlink & Asus and they just didn't offer as good range and reliability as R6300. Netgear might release a replacement soon, but for now this is still the best overall AC router despite what reviews say on smallnetbuilder website.UPDATE 1/9/2013I've been using this router for over half a year now and it hasn't skipped the beat. Performance has been top notch and it can handle 15 wireless clients with a few HD IP Cameras. It's been running uninterrupted for the past 3 month. Sure there are other new AC routers that came out since then, which I haven't tested, but this has been a wonderful router so far and I am not looking for another replacement at the moment. Not surprising that the price is exactly what I paid 6 month ago, which means the router is actually holds its value for being one of the best out there.INTROMy past 3 year history of routers include Netgear WDR3700, Cisco E4200 and most recently two Asus RT-N56u using wireless bridge, but I was never impressed with the speed of wireless and 5Ghz band coverage. This was about time for my next upgrade, so I bought 3 routers RT-N66U, Amped Wireless R20000G & Netgear R6300 and I kept the latter and here is why:THE GOOD:- Range/Speed/Performance in 5 Ghz band: Excellent! While not a huge leap forward it does perform much better than any of the previous and competing routers I've tried using this band. This was a major selling point for me. It is actually able to provide excellent download speeds in the opposite corner of the 1500 sq/feet townhome that none of the other routers could handle. Also with Mac Mini 2010 Broadcom wifi, I was able to achieve up to 22 MB/sec download speed from NAS at about 15 feet with latest firmware. Previously with RT-N56 it topped at 10 MB/sec at the same location. That's double the speed! I can't wait to try this out with AC clients!- Range/Speed/Performance in 2.4 Ghz band: The range is excellent. It covers my entire home, but so did my previous router, so it's difficult to judge the improvement here.  However, there is noticeable performance boost. Among several wireless devices using this band I have 4 HD (1080p - 720p) IP cameras and previous Asus router had trouble with handling all of them with good frame rate where with R6300 I am finally able to stream all of them at once. Also, your performance will depend on the client. Previously I was using 2010 HP Envy 14 w/ Intel 6200 which was showing download speed at 4-6 MB/sec, 2012 HP Envy 17 w/ Intel 6300 showing much better results at 6-8 MB/Sec at the same location. While Mac Mini 2010 w/ Broadcom WiFi shows speeds less then 1MB sec. Basically, older clients may have some performance issues.- Setup:  It wasn't complicated all and looks fairly straight forward for non-technical people as well.- Plenty of features for basic and advanced users: Guest network, Wireless bridge etc... all thereI CAN DEAL WITH IT:- Size: This router is about twice the size of any of the previous routers I've owned- Guest Network: Yes, it's available, but it's very basic. I've seen Asus RT-N66U guest network control which lets you specify the time limit or expiration.- Administration panel locks after about a minute of inactivity and you are prompted to enter your username & password again (very annoying when you trying to troubleshoot things!)- Parental features. I don't like the fact that you need to install tool on your pc, there is no web administration on management in the web ui.OTHER THINGS:- First router that I see without WEP setting.- Some of the older clients (specifically HP Envy 14 w/ Intel 6200 card) had connection issues with sleep/restart. I've upgraded my laptop since then and have not had this issue anymore- Mine appears to be defective where the activity lights at the bottom are not lighting up, except Netgear logo. (UPDATE 7/10 I've gotten a new one without this issue)PREVIOUS UPDATES:UPDATE 10/13: This is probably going to be my last update since I really don't have anything else to add other then this has been a wonderful router ever since I upgraded to 1.0.2.36_1.0.28 version. I've been running without reboots for a month now and no problems with performance whatsoever.UPDATE 9/6: 3 month later and still loving this router. If you live in a large home and have wireless coverage issues with 5 Ghz band you should definitely give this one a try. Overall it's been rock stable for me with only one nagging issue related to 5Ghz band (see my previous update). Netgear support got a hold of me and I've been helping them to troubleshoot the issue by sending router logs. They provided a beta update for me that fixed the issue which they will be releasing in September.UPDATE 7/10: Month later the router still performs very well. I am hoping for new firmware soon to improves performance and compatibility with older devices. Still have issues with Envy 14, Mac Mini 2010 and also HTC Sensation phone. They all exhibit different issues. First one takes a long time to connect, second one has very low speed on 2 Ghz band and last one occasionally unable to connect. There was also one hiccup. I was running uninterrupted for 2 weeks straight using latest firmware and 5Gh signal degraded from Excellent to Poor and 4 to 2 bars at the same location. I've rebooted the router and everything went back to normal.UPDATE 6/13: 2 weeks now with the router. Sold my two Asus N56U that I used as a wireless bridge and that were once highly rated at SNB. I honestly do not know why SNB posted terrible results with R6300, they must have defective unit but that's still not the case for me. I am perfectly satisfied with R6300 and it delivers excellent performance/range throughout the house without the need of any bridges or extenders which I once had to use. I do have defective unit where I don't get any activity lights, so I might exchange it at some point. Did I mention, this is an awesome router?UPDATE 6/7: Netgear released new firmware which enables Guest network that caused so much noise and negative reviews in the initial release, the were no other fixes listed, but upon my own checking I noticed they added ""Performance boost"" option in the Advanced > Wireless settings. I performed my usual download test which showed a slight increase in download speed on 5Ghz band, but it's hard to say if it was related to the firmware or not.UPDATE 6/4: SmallNetBuilder released preliminary test results that compare performance R6300 with a few other N routers that show that it doesn't perform as good as expected in some cases. Also mentioned my results in the process when compared to N56U. I only had R6300 for a few days now, but my experience for the most part has been positive even with a rough firmware. Also, I usually base my router purchases by SNB reviews, but in this case I am having different results, so I'll stick with R6300 for now. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(8542, 8556)"

I'll 'pause' the audio for whatever reason and then restart it with 'play' (both on the headset) and every once in a while some other audio will start playing -- like instead of continuing the podcast, some other podcast or some song will start.  I'm guessing this is some setting in Android, but I don't really know, and when it happens I'll have to pull over and take the phone out and find right app and find the thing I was listening to again, and get that playing again.  I haven't figured out if the headset is sending sloppy button signals, or the phone is just timing out, or what's going on.  It happens maybe 1 out of 10 times.  The Backbeat has the same problem (actually, worse).My last headset had microphone noise suppression for calls (I think it had two mics and did waveform subtraction) and I could talk to people in full wind or street noise and they didn't even know I was outside.  This mic doesn't have that, and people on calls with me always complain about the wind noise, so I have to slow way down or stop and walk.This is still a fantastic headset, and at a great price ($45).  If they would add microphone noise suppression like my other one, I would happily pay double for this.  Aside from that, this is still a fantastic headset.One other thought: this headset has the plug-in (to the ear) ear buds that form an air-tight seal.  Around the office I prefer the Backbeats because they sit in the ear and don't make the air-tight seal, so I can hear the office noises and people better.

B00BGA9WK2,electronics,How do you like the design?,"Let me say, I was going to pass on the new generation of gaming consoles because, these consoles simply don't match up well with most of the mid-level gaming machines on paper. However, having played every generation of Console from the Atari 2600 to the present, made passing up the chance to buy one on launch day hard to resist. So, I got the email notification that the PS4 was now on sale and I pulled the trigger.First, I'm not a hardcore gamer by any means and my consoles are reserved for platformers, sports games, and racing games with FPS and RPGs being pushed to the PC. To me, the console is supposed to be fun first and foremost and if for any reason it fails to live up to that billing then, it fails as a console. With that said, let me get right into my review.ENGINEERING AND DESIGNThe console is slim, the graphics are fast enough, and the design is really sharp.It is a pretty nice piece of hardware and it delivers some pretty nice image quality but, in terms of computing power, most mid-range computers with discrete graphics are as strong or stronger but, that's now why you would buy a console.  You buy a console for simplicity and convenience and Sony manages to do fairly well with the design in these areas.CONTROLSYou know, I never had an issue with the past PlayStation controllers outside of the fact that they were too lite and felt more fragile than they actually were. The PS4 Dual Shock controllers feel really good and have a decent amount of weight to them in your hand.The touch pad on the controller is a little awkward in that it serves a function but, it was almost like they added it as a me too kind of feature when they saw the Wii U controller (it is better than people give it credit for). I guess we might see more use for it in the future but, I've only used it for Escape Plan (Indy Title) killzone Shadow Fall (Awkwardly too I might add).The options button, does just what it says, it brings up a menu of features or options for every aspect of the system. It just works and I find no fault with this other than it is a rebadged select button.The share button, I'm dumbfounded by this button, yeah it is cool but, really??? All I can do is share on Facebook or Twitter with it! It's baffling to say the least as I don't see either of those as being the place where people upload videos very often. Where is the YouTube or Daily Motion options Seriously, it is confusing at best unless you're going to live stream your game play (Let's not even talk about the added uselessness of the poor quality videos it records or the HDCP Copy Protection even when gaming).This voice control isn't very good on this console.  First, you won't even know it has the option if you don't plug the mic in to the controller or connect the camera.  Second, there are all of like 8 commands and those only accept a limited number of variables.  Third, I often had to say PlayStation twice even though the mic was literally right next to my mouth!The controller is decent overall but, the voice controls are average at best.The one caveat is that the Xbox One brought Kinect Interaction with voice commands in many 3rd party titles ad those developers actually left them in the Game for the PS4 versions of the games and these do work well.INTERFACEThis is one area where Sony has learned from the PS3.They broke the settings, messaging, and other features off to their own section of the main screen and that works great for me.  This is a big plus over the previous generation.The biggest downsides appear to be in their decision making process.They gave you the ability to upgrade the drive so, you can put a 3 TeraByte drive into the machine but, all of your apps install to the center line on the console and that could honestly become huge and unmanageable (Even if the most recently used are in the front).  What makes this even more bizarre is the fact that this very line has a folder called Library but, do they put everything in there?  Nope, just the digital stuff!  Why?  Seriously, move all the apps to this folder and let us choose what's on the main screen!Another flaw is in the Battery Meter implementation.  When you first sign in to the console, yhe meter is in the upper right hand side of the screen and disappears...  After that you tap the PS button and WTF??? nothing happens??? You then learn you have to hold the PS button in, go all the way to the log out screen and you find the meter again but, it isn't in the upper right as large as day!!! Nope, it is now a tiny icon in the lower right near your name.  Not sure what they were thinking here but, this is poor design.LAUNCH GAMESThis is a big area where I feel like Sony dropped the ball as most games are only slightly above average and none of them (even to this day) will blow you away or make you feel like you've gotten your money's worth from the system.Killzone: Shadow FallThis is pretty much a straight up FPS where the opening cityscapes look very cool but, the game isn't free roaming at that point so you can look but don't touch...  As you get further into the game some of the visual quality degrades fast (The flowing river looks like it is from the Quake 1 days before the Monster 3D).  For the most part, I've found the game boring to say the least even if it does look stunning in parts.KnackThis is a pretty much a hack and slash 3/4 overhead platformer and honestly it has gotten mistreated by the media.  The game is actually a lot of fun but, not as visually pleasing as its other launch siblings.  This game represents the realization that good looking does not always mean most fun and to me, I'm relearning this with this generation of consoles.ResogunThis was a PSN freebie and while it is cool, it is pretty much a copy of the Classic title Defender on Steroids so, if you liked Defender, you'll likely love this game.  I had some fun playing it but, like Defender, I never really got into it.PLAYSTATION NETWORKThe PSN has only a fraction of the servers that Xbox Live has and this was something I hadn't realized when I purchased the PS4. While this hadn't been a big issue since launch, it became a much larger issue with the opening of all those Christmas consoles as the past week has had a lot of lag when trying to play games online and even making a connection is sometimes a challenge.The plus side to the network is that you can use Amazon Prime, Netflix, and other streaming apps without having a membership to PlayStation Plus where as Xbox requires a Live Gold membership to even use those apps.Another benefit is the fact that you get free games that are yours as long as you keep a membership with PS+.Also, game sharing is a feature of the PSN network but, you have to login to the other persons console to download the games to it is kind an awkward sharing feature that isn't very practical.A PS Plus membership does allow up to 5 accounts to play games online but, only the primary member has cloud sync capability and this creates an issue when a company like EA screws up and writes all saved campaign data to the cloud.  With the Xbox Live, you everybody gets access to your Live Gold service and all of its features so, everybody gets the cloud on Xbox One.INTERFACEThe Sony interface is pretty straight forward and familiar to most.There are two rows of icons where the first row is pretty much set and it will always be the same regardless of what is installed on the system. The second row is where your library and games are stored and honestly, this row is kind of annoying because you everything you install forms one giant horizontal row of apps and games and that to me is out of control!Overall it is pretty simple to use, in some ways it is easier than Xbox One but, not in others.For instance, they gave you the battery indicator but, it appears one place when launching the system and another entirely when using the system, that's really poor for continuity if you ask me.CUSTOMER SERVICEHere's where the wheels fall off the console! The previously mentioned issues with NBA 2K14 are a big enough issue that I approached Sony for a refund as I bought the game on a digital download... Not only did they refuse to help with the situation, they pretty much didn't even see the connection between me buying the game from them and their level of responsibility with that.I spent a good 30 to 40 minutes arguing with the Sony Support reps and pretty much left with the resolution that they're never going to help me and I'm not going to buy another digital download from them!Sony Support angered me so much, I actually did sell the console about 6 weeks later and while this wasn't the only reason I sold it, it was a big reason why.Of course, on a side note, 2K finally reached out to me and told me they would give me all my VC back if I delete my player and start over. That stinks but, it is either that or lose the money and the fact that it took them 3 weeks to even acknowledge my request with no help from Sony at all leaves me questioning Sony's commitment to their customers and I will never buy another digital item from Sony and I'll be passing on Take Two games in the future.MISSING FEATURESFirst, I had no idea the console didn't support 3D Bluray when I bought it and I also had no idea that DLNA and even playback of movies or music from USB Media wasn't allowed either!Let me just say that both this and the Xbox One are incomplete consoles. However, this is a pretty complete list of things this console cannot do.*No YouTube uploading*No YouTube App #1 Video sharing service and no support at all.*No Google+ Support (this affects YouTube or it wouldn't really matter)*No Streaming or Playing of MP3 or MP4 files (not even from your PC or USB drive)*No Support for external hard drives at all at this point (most of the list comes from Sony)*No Sony Support for apps purchased from their digital store (so buy the hard copies)*No Ability to rename your online account (MS does this but, it will cost $20)*No Promoting a Child Account to an adult account, they get to start over*No Suspending or Resuming Games or Apps*No Support for 3D BluraySome of you might be okay without these features but, some will no doubt not like this at all.CONCLUSIONI'm torn between love and hate for this console and its creator. I really do love the console but, I really hate Sony right now and unfortunately, you cannot have one without the other.Overall, the lack of DLNA support, 3D Bluray, Removable Media Support, Poor Sony Support, Poor game library,  and a console that is even less complete than the Xbox One are all factors as to why I decided to sell the unit.Maybe some day I'll revisit this console again but, Sony has a real problem on their hands in my opinion because they have a console that lacks all the best features of their previous generation (and many of those from their competition).  I know most people say, that Sony is really focused on gamin and they had better be because the Console doesn't do very much else!What you really get here is a console that is focused on games and yet doesn't have a single game that would make you run out and buy it at the moment.  Sony is presently selling these units based on a spec sheet but, when people start to realize it isn't very fun, those numbers might just drop off pretty fast!I would say, pass on this console until they get more games out because, what they have now isn't worth it!

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,How are the people like?,"I see more than one thousand reviews are here. Let me keep this simple. I don't have a netflix account neither i use google video&music.; I watch some youtubes but those are short clips. I do watch amazon prime videos but no chromecast apps are available for that. Still, as you know, these is a way though.When you set up your chromecast, wifi connection is required even if you are using the wired lan cable. Here is the point.WIFI IS NOT REQUIRED AFTER THE INITIAL SETUP.The reason casting your chrome browser lags is this. When casting youtube, it's pretty much the dongle that is doing most of the job. That's why it works great. However, when you casting your browser, two way traffics are going on. That's why it lags. Most wireless connections are slower than wired lan. Well some hi-tech wireless would certainly beat wired but that's not for many of us. Then, if we can make at least one way faster, we can assume that casting with your browser would be much better.(I assume you know how to do it. 1)Get the chrome browser for PC 2) download the extension named as google cast 3) put folder's path on the browser 4) browse and run the file 5) click the extension on the right top and cast 6)if you are just casting the screen of your chrome then you don't need 3)and4))Okay, once I set up, I took off my wifi usb adapter for my desktop and connect it with lan cable. Nothing fancy, just a simple cat5e cable. Do I have an expensive router? No way. Mine is refurbished Cisco Valet M20. Got it less than $20.My computer is a bit high-tech. But I assume it doesn't matter since my laptop returned the same result.The difference is huge. With two-way WIFI, I can't even make it with high 720p option on the chrome browser. The amazon video lags so bad that I had to set it to 480p. Playing local video files was worse. I played 2 gb 720p mkv file just FYI.With wired and WIFI, it works great. I would say it's 90% perfect. With wired cable, I can set it to extreme 720p and it still works great. NO lags whatsoever. amazon prime videos or local media files. Since I don't have 1080p files in my HDD, I couldn't test it. However, 720p mkv file worked just great. This means ANY STREAMING on your PC chrome will cast to your tv with the dongle without lagging. hulu, hbo, vemeo.. you just name it.I know the chromcast app on your PC will still ask for wifi connection. However, it works without it as long as you are connected to the same router.Well, hope this helps for those non-netflix users but still thinking about buying this.

B00A39PPCG,electronics,How is the sound?,"Sources: iPhone5 alone, iPhone5 with Decware Zen Head amp via LOD, iPhone5 with v-moda Verza DAC/amp, various computers using the Microstreamer DAC/amp.First impression of the V-MODA M100: Bass! The kind you don't have to quibble about. It's there in abundance for any conceivable need you might have. That aside, I see this M100 as 2 headphones in one (a bargain BTW) - the extra-bass model for gaming, TV action film, house and other bass-centric music, and the hi-fi model (using bass reduction) for symphonies, folk and acoustic, jazz, rock/pop/metal, and other such delicate genres. Unless otherwise noted, all comments below apply to the M100 using bass reduction, since I listen to music in quiet places mainly, and my tastes are mostly midrange-centric.The M100's sound is slightly dark, having 1-2 db less output in the presence area around 3-5 khz and more output in the upper bass than many other full-size headphones (ex: Beyer COP, B&O; H6, Senn MOE). Some of the other dark-sounding headphones I have don't compete with the M100, because they don't have the clarity and accuracy of musical tone that comes with the higher quality drivers and manufacturing standards that the M100 benefits from. Despite the impression of 'dark', the overall sound is quite lush, and very smooth from top to bottom. Although I stated above that all of the comments from here down apply to using bass reduction with the M100, I must repeat here that with bass reduction on, the bass is as strong as any good hi-fi headphone that has good bass. Some of the so-called 'neutral' headphones will have bass that's significantly weaker than the M100 even when the M100 bass is reduced, so I think the concept of hi-fi neutral is overdue for a revision.Some reviews I've read describe the M100's midrange as recessed, but of course that's with the default bass as I noted above. How you perceive the midrange depends a lot on where you play the M100. Outdoors, on public transport, in a noisy club - those environments tend to absorb most of the bass, so the M100 should be ideal in those cases when played flat (no EQ). Listening at home late at night when it's very quiet is where you'll hear the most detail, since the background noise level can be 30 or more db lower than outdoors in the daytime, and even a lot lower than the indoor daytime noise level. In summary, excellent sound for high fidelity music playback, if you follow my reasoning. Soundstage is mostly dependent on the music of course, but frequency balance plays a large role as well - since most reviewers are adamant about not using EQ, when they evaluate the M100 in their very quiet listening locations, the strong bass makes the midrange seem more distant, hence the soundstage follows from there.Isolation seems quite good, but most isolation is at the higher frequencies, so loud noises from air conditioners or dishwashers etc. may intrude if your music is soft and quiet. Leakage is low, but if you're in a very quiet office in a cubicle right next to other cubicles and you play your music loud, someone in the next cube may hear your music faintly, and some people are bothered by the least bit of leakage that way. It's very doubtful that leakage from the M100 would be noticeable to anyone on a noisy bus, train, or plane.My first M100 was pearl white, and this one is matte black. The sound seems about the same a year after the first one I had, and the fit is very similar also. But just in case I had the impression of a tight fit with my first M100, this current M100 is ultra-comfortable - so much so that I'm wearing it for hours at a time with no adjustments. The sound is so good (as described above) that I'm enjoying classical, jazz, electronic, rock, and other genres of music like never before - everything from Daft Punk, David Chesky, and David Lynch sounds just as spectacular as Michael Buble, Korn, and Miles Davis.The M100 in matte black (my color choice) is beautiful, and its military-gear stealth look is not only very classy, it doesn't tend to show dirt and grime. The military-grade look isn't just superficial though - the build quality is the best in the headphone business - all metal and perfectly finished, but not heavy on the head. At the time I purchased the M100, an extra set of metal earcup side plates was offered, with choice of color and even a custom logo. Those custom plates aren't expensive and they can be attached or detached at any time, so if the headphone is transferred to another person that person can use the standard side plates instead. Headband clamping force with the M100 is very moderate for a full-size headphone, and if the headband were ever to become uncomfortable on top of a user's head, I suggest pulling the earcups down an extra click so most of the weight is borne by the earcups.The earpads go completely around my ears, unlike some headphones that are described as circumaural (around the ear). The Sennheiser Momentum is one such headphone where the earpads sit partially on my average-size ears. The earpads are very soft and spongy, covered in 'pleather' I would guess, and are the most comfortable type of earpad I've used. The M100 has a single-sided detachable cable that can be plugged into either the left or right earcup. The fabric-covered cable is terminated with a 45-degree angled Apple miniplug, and the end that goes into the earcup is a standard (non-Apple) miniplug. In case of cable failure, any generic miniplug to miniplug cable could be used, as long as the sleeve ahead of the plug that goes into the earcup is no bigger than 7mm in diameter.The 4-foot cable has a one-button control with mic about 13 inches down from the earcup, and an additional mic about 4 inches down from the earcup. A second (7-foot) cable is included, having the same plugs as the 4-foot cable, but no controls or microphone. The 7-foot cable also has a short (3.5 inches) extension on the end in a 'Y' configuration, where you can plug a second headphone in. I didn't try it, but I wonder what the effect on the sound would be if you plugged two 18-ohm headphones into a music player using this cable. It seems like that would create a 9-ohm load for the music player, or even less if the minimum impedance of the headphones were less than 18 ohms. The M100 comes with a small zippered carrycase that's suitable for backpacks and airline carry-on bags.In previous reviews I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to those other reviews and see how the M100 compares with each individual track. Note that the comments below apply to the M100's sound played with Bass Reducer EQ as noted above.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals sound natural, without favoring either. The M100 plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off sounds realistic, and the sax is soft. The M100 plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice is crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The M100 reproduces the space and detail convincingly, although if this is played very loudly the percussion may be too bright.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments. The voice and high-frequency percussion (tambourine especially) sounds natural with no harshness. The M100 plays this music perfectly.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track has good detail, and the ambient electronic effects maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or ""ringy"" sound as some headphones do if they have uncorrected resonances. The M100 plays this track just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The M100 handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track has good detail, and the percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced. The M100 makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the M100 handles this perfectly. The trumpet sounds natural but soft, and the voice has the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The M100 does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the M100 handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep ""shuddery"" kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the M100 delivers on those.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the M100 gets it right. The percussion and female voice balance well with neither overwriting the other. The M100 aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the M100. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The M100 balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices have a good balance and don't overpower the music or sound recessed. The M100 plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The M100 plays this very well given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The M100 renders the percussion treble correctly (bright, but not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The M100 renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some ""clip-clop"" effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The M100 reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality. The M100 plays this track very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the M100 renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The M100 delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the M100. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, sounds so perfect that this track could easily have been mixed using the M100 headphone.

They should have put it in an easier spot to get to and see.The other thing is also the lack of Google Play apps.  There are many on there I want that are not available.  Some other reviewer said there is a way to get them.  I have not tried figuring that out yet.Besides those two things I have no other complaints.  Obviously because it is a tablet the battery does go down faster if you are using it for other things than just reading.  Another thing to consider is it is heavy because of all the features it has.  So its not as easy to carry around or stick in a pocket or purse like a stand-alone ereader would do.  So that is something to consider.It has great functions and great picture quality.  It also has a camera and you can skype.

Read the original review, it is still true.I bought this particular product because I need high capacity ""live"" and fast storage while I consolidate and re-organize the video materials that underlie the almost 900 YouTube videos I have created.I bought a USB 3 adapter (Winstars WS-UH302P USB 3.0 PCI-Express Card, 2 external port) from a local computer vendor: the data transfer rate difference between USB3 and USB2 is well worth the cost of the adapter ... and the price on this HDD device is excellent! The transfer rate of the drive itself is excellent.Discovered one of the ""smart"" aspects of this Seagate drive: when you power the computer down, this expansion drive also powers down.  At first I was irritated that it didn't have a power switch, but now understand why a switch isn't needed  :^)When running, the case is barely warm to the touch ... the design and placement of the passive venting holes appears to have been done right.Under Windows 7, you just plug it in and the needed driver is automatically taken care of.  (Under Win2000Pro, the anti-virus tried to block the automatic driver set up ... easily remedied.)Unlike some USB3-based stand alone products, the USB3 cable in the box is long enough to reach!  They did not skimp on that.The upshot is this: I liked the first one so much, I shortly bought another of the same (and same USB3 adapter) for my other Win7 machine.If this drive crashes (somehow) prematurely, I'll let you know.

B005HMKKH4,electronics,Who is the driver?,"///Update: 26Oct2012///After some Googling, I found that it is a common issue with WD that you cannot view two or more HD's plugged in. There are several fixes, but the most common and reliable way is to go to your Computer Management (Windows) and click the unrecognized drive ""online"". You can then assign it a different Drive Letter which will then allow you to see it every time you plug it in. Without going into too much details, basically WD assigned the same signature to the drives that is why it is showing up as one drive at a time. As a result, I moved the rating up to 5 stars. Enjoy!///Original: 12Oct2012///I love how small it still is (compared to a regular 1TB). When I travel I try to maximize my contents without compromising the weight and space taken. I often have to travel in just a backpack for several days so having the drive is perfect for having my digital movies and tv because it does not require an adapter for power (just USB) and it does not take up so much room. Because of the amount of files I own, I ended up buying 3 of these (only needed 2, but didn't realize I previously bought one already).I do however have some issues with it. Unfortunately, laptops cannot recognize two of the same type of drive. So if you were to transfer files from one drive to the next, you much use a median to temporarily store your data first (ie. laptop itself or a non-WD 2TB Passport Drive).Other than that, I am quite satisfied. Data transfer with USB 3.0 is noticeably superior to USB 2.0. In comparison to cheaper drives with USB 3.0 (not to cause blame on other drives), this performed data transfer faster and more consistently.

First off it's tiny.  You can clip it on your lapel, jacket or put it in your pocket. It is very easy to use. No messing with software or bloated programs. I plugged it in to the USB port and that was it.  I guess it could have a longer battery life but that doesn't bother me much as it charges quickly.  The sound quality is really good for such a tiny device.  I spent time and money trying to make my ipod sound better (upgraded earphones etc.) The clip sounded good right out of the box. It synced quickly even from my old computer. Overall, I can see why people love this MP3 player.My only complaint was that the first one I received was defective.

B0096YOQRY,electronics,How is the remote?,"The picture is pretty GOOD. I'm not going to say great but it's pretty good for the price. I did some extensive homework before I bought this as I was looking for a smart tv that offered an alternative to hooking it up to several components for a guest bedroom. Instead I liked it so much that I ended up putting this in my bedroom and switching it out with a slightly older Sylvania flat screen I had (great picture) for the guest room. The slim, sleekness of it takes a little getting used to in terms of the screen- you have a thinner frame and more screen to look at if that makes sense. The apps and streaming are pretty good for what you get and Vizio is constantly updating to add more apps. There is a slight learning curve when trying to link it up with your wifi however I found that by turning it off & on after the initial info is entered helped in terms of getting the tv to connect. It took two tries for me but afterwards it was smooth sailing. Again the Netflix, Hulu and other apps are good. There's some interesting freebie channel apps where you can watch old tv shows in there too at no cost so that's kind of nice to have. My favorite feature of this television hands down is the ability to plug in a usb drive and play multiple types of video files automatically without having to hook it up to a PC or DVD player. You can also play mp3 files and look at photos, etc. but I was really impressed by the number of files it would play without too much of a problem. The remote that comes with the TV is a sore spot here and I'll tell you why. They provide you with a smart tv that allows you to access online streaming and other applications yet you get this remote that is more for a basic TV with no buttons such as for launching Netflix or other hotkeys for the streaming apps it offers. This is where Vizio literally Cheapens out this model. The remote is also small, lengthy and complicated in terms of a million tiny keys. There is also no keyboard. You would think that a smart tv would come equipped with a remote that offered a keyboard yet it does not. I realized this is part of the reason why this tv is a bit of a bargain compared to other smart TVs out there. At any rate, I resolved this by replacing the remote with the VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard remote (bought here on Amazon for about $12). I know this is not ideal for some because the idea is that you get a brand new tv and you shouldn't have to spend extra $$ on an additional remote however I recommend it in this case as the little cheap universal that comes with this set will drive you mad. You really do want a remote with a Qwerty Keyboard on the back as this will come in handy if/when you do a search on youtube or Netflix or Hulu--you won't be there forever trying to navigate letters on-screen with the up/down remote toggle keys (eyes rolling). Now for the rest of this thing- it's got great picture and some pretty good choice settings for gaming, etc. You just have to get in there and explore it. Some people have complained that the picture looks dimmer than when they saw it on the showroom floor however I just found that I adjusted the controls and it seems to be fine. I believe also that this set has an automatic sensor built-in that adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on the level of light in the room. I have not played with it enough to find out for sure whether or not this is something you can turn off or adjust. There are only two HDMI connections and that can be bothersome to some. For me this wasn't an issue as I don't always hook this up to a PC however it was good to have it hooked up to my cable box but honestly two connections was fine for me. Gamers and PC enthusiasts may get irritated at this small amount of HDMI connections so buyer beware there. Again, this was one of the cheapest smart tv models out there with good reviews that I found so i'm not too surprised it lacks a few things. Some folks have complained at the slowness of the TV to power on and I will say it takes about 20-30 seconds which can get on your nerves. All I can say there is to just have some patience and resist the urge to keep hitting the power switch as I learned the hard way you might actually activate a hard-reset of the television by doing that. That brings me to mention a safety feature the tv has built-in in the event of a power surge or storm. I came home one evening after a wicked rain storm to find the tv buzzing at me every few seconds after I'd turned it on. It kept making a noise similar to those you hear when a weather bulletin flashes on your screen from your local news, etc. I couldn't get the TV to stop doing this so after trying to adjust the settings for a good half hour and finding no solution to this I did some research on the net and found this was a result of a built in sensor that is designed to protect the TV from shorting out if an electrical surge occurs (which apparently did). So the solution to this was to power it off and unplug it from the power source for a good 20 minutes. Once we did this, it came right back on and adjusted to normal as if nothing had happened. Overall it's a very interesting unit with good picture and a fairly good amount of &#34;smart&#34; apps for an entry level smart tv. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5272, 5286)"

All I have to say is that it definitely exceeded my own expectations, especially at this price range.  And they sounded amazing right out of the box...no warm-up period needed.  The clarity of these headsets are amazing and are on par, if not better, than my Bose QC15s, though the sound quality on those aren't exactly known to be all that great.  Either way, they have no business sounding this amazing at under $15.  I will say that if you are a fan of heavy, thumping bass, these are not ideal, but they were perfectly fine for me.If I do have one complaint, its the fit.

The satellite acquisition is super fast and at least a full minute quicker than the GPS V.

I also like the fact that you can update the unit's already HUGE 700MB memory bucket with inexpensive SD cards.Accuracy: No GPS is perfect and I have had some ""interesting"" route suggestions by this(Same map data as the GPS V), but none have been dead on wrong. 99% of the time you can count on this device to get you where you need to be.

You can even add various accents. I currently have mine set to the Australian female. (There are only female voices, by the way). The unit alerts you in plenty of time for you next turn, exit, etc. The unit also has a few other bells and whistles that I find more of a niche than neccessity, but all work well. Compared to my iPod Video 60GB, the MP3 audio is 95% as clean and the controls are very intuative. The photo viewer is a nice touch as well.All in all this is honestly THE best GPS out right now for mobile navigation.

B0074BW614,electronics,Is the option available?,"First, let me say that I am an avid Kindle user and have been from the days of Kindle 1. Over the years since the first Kindle, I have purchased vast quantities of Kindle books. Currently, I own 5 Kindles (6 with the Fire HD). They are: the Kindle 1 (by far the best display of all the later e-ink kindles with an SD card slot and a user replaceable battery, which later editions omitted), returned a Kindle 2 for display issues, kept a Kindle 3 (Keyboard), own 2 Kindle touches, the original Fire, and now the Fire HD. All are used by my family. So when I ordered the KF-HD it was with high expectations of really wanting to love this thing. I use the original Fire all the time and love it. Here's what I found about the new Kindle Fire HD:Out of the box the hardware is impressive to say the least, and having used it extensively since receiving it, I find it this Kindle has too many problems to justify keeping the unit until they fix some MAJOR engineering mistakes and software inadequacies that are embarrassingly idiotic. The first Kindle Fire works great. This one, well, leaves much to be desired. Here are the Pros and Cons, as I have experienced them:Pros:1. Fantastic sound with the Dolby turned on. If this feature is off, the speakers sound worse than the original Kindle Fire. You can get this same sound on the original Kindle Fire using good external speakers or a good set of headphones.2. Whispersync with Voice (concurrent with a very big con, see below).3. Text to Speech.4. Very crisp and clear display (with a concurrent con, see below).Cons:1. The HD video display when viewing videos is either slightly on the orange to green side for skin tones (as compared to the original KF). The original Kindle Fire had much more realistic flesh tones on videos. All videos, at least in my opinion.2. The power cable attaches to the side of the unit, rather than at the top or bottom, making it impossible to charge and watch or read anything in landscape mode while charging. This is a major inconvenience. Given a choice between an HDMI cable output and a charging indicator, give me a charging indicator and let the Cloud do its job so it's unnecessary to plug in the Fire to a TV.3. No charging indicator light. How basic is this?? All other Kindle's have indicator lights! Was this an oversight? Or,engineering stupidity at it's best...you decide.4. Power switch and volume control are flush with the casing, impossible to see and/or find in the dark-unless you turn the unit on its side and push til you find a switch.5. Consistently has problems connecting with a wireless connection, giving the error of ""authentication failure"", making it necessary to connect using the ""Settings, Wireless, Connect"" from the settings menu (works fine after that).6. Whispersync for Voice and Audible.com do not communicate well at all! I bought several books (free) with free associated audio books from audible.com. What a nightmare! Audible.com does not automatically link your Amazon account, and when it does, it picks the first 3 devices to use on your account there. If the first 3 do not list your kindle fire HD, you cannot download the books wirelessly to your device from Amazon's Manage Your Kindle page or Audible.com's My Library page. Further, unless you deregister your device and then re-register it, you cannot change the order of the availability of your devices. However, when you do download the book and follow the link for ""professional narration"", it will link in for a purchase. You must then open your book in the Kindle Fire HD, and touch the bottom of the screen on the Chapter 1 page (beginning of book) for it to first download a sample audio, and then the purchased audio from Audible.com. MAJOR HASSLE. Without seamless integration of these two services, Kindle books and Audible.com, it becomes a big frustration very quickly. Did I mention that Audible.com charges $14.95 PER MONTH for membership? Not user friendly in a recession/depression environment! How about a ""no strings attached"" membership? Finally, Audible.com only permits 3 Kindle devices to be on your account. For my household, with 6 Kindles, this doesn't beget customer satisfaction, or a desire to become a member of Audible.com.Additionally, some of the free books linked to Whispersync for Voice I had previously purchased. Unfortunately, those editions would not link to Whispersync for Voice, meaning I had to re-purchase (albeit free) the book (different edition) to link to and then purchase (again with a free promotion) the audio book from Audible.com. For a paid version of a Kindle book that also has an audible version available but no link to Whispersync (those links are listed on the book product page) means you have to use a particular Kindle book with the particular companion Audible.com audible book. Bummer.7. Ads. Ads. Ads. For $199 I expect an Ad-free environment. Not here! You have to ""opt-out"" for an additional charge ($15). BAD MOVE for Amazon. Even then, once you opt-out, the continual ""suggestions"" are annoying and intrusive to the extreme. This does not exist on the original Kindle Fire.8. No SD card slot, a continuing Amazon deficiency (especially when dealing with content when you are out of Wi-Fi range), and no user replaceable battery. This is where my Kindle 1 shines. I keep categories of books on different SD cards because (obviously) the drive in K1 is inadequate to the task of taking my entire library along. The Kindle Keyboard (4 GB storage) houses my complete library, but not the Kindle Touch (2GB storage). You may ask, why is this important with the cloud drive available? Because ever since Amazon ripped my paid-for copy of George Orwell's 1984 off my Kindle without my permission, I do not trust my purchased content exclusively to Amazon's cloud drive. I back it up immediately to the computer.9. No Favorites section below the Carousel without going through the ""Favorites"" Star icon. Great when you can find it, annoying when you can't.10. Inconsistent displays on the Carousel. Not all items are displayed, they mysteriously disappear and reappear. When you tap them to open sometimes they do, and other times they just shake in place without opening. Other times, when trying to remove them from the Carousel, once you ""tap and hold"", the concurrent menu allowing you to remove the item from the device, the carousel or add/remove from Favorites does not appear at all. The ""shimmy"" effect of a vibrating icon on the Carousel is very disturbing (at least to me), making me wonder if it's trying to crash (aka a computer crash).12. No YouTube. No YouTube app that works.13. Email display is horrific both in portrait and landscape modes. Once an email is opened you have to scroll to read side-to-side, with a column list of your emails on the left (in landscape mode) which cannot be changed.14. Android Apps for Kindle Fire purchased for the original Kindle Fire may or may not (mostly not) work on the new Kindle Fire HD. When I asked about this, Customer Service told me they were ""working on it."" Right out of the box this is inexcusable. It's like saying, ""You can't have all your Kindle books which you purchased on this device because it is not going to work yet for those items"".15. Huge screen glare problem. Just gotta love seeing my face and the room around me while doing anything with this Kindle! The ""anti-glare screen protector"" recommended by Amazon is anything but anti-glare, and (conveniently) no other anti-glare screen protectors offered will fit the KFHD.16. The ""recommended"" case by Amazon only allows the KF to be installed one way and the display to face one way when using the stand, so you can't watch a movie even if you flip it over to view a movie in landscape mode while charging. Unfortunately, due to the location of the power cable (when plugged in), this makes it impossible to watch a movie using the case as a stand while the power cord is plugged in. The stand use of the case is unstable. If you read in bed, as I do, I find this to be a massive problem. The RooCase for the Original Kindle Fire accomplished both tasks for the original KF nicely.17. Camera only works with Skype (and Facebook with a lot of fiddling with an app to make it happen).My advice is PASS ON THIS PURCHASE. WAIT FOR KINDLE FIRE HD 3. Mine is going back, and I would advise anyone wanting a Kindle Fire to buy a refurbished original KF from Amazon (if any) or go to eBay. This one is too expensive and too buggy--perhaps released too quickly before fixing engineering and software glitches. For me, the Cons far outweighed the Pros to the point that this device is not for me. Hopefully my observations will help someone in their purchase decision. I really did want to keep this device; however, given the financial times and the inherent problems I have experienced with the KFHD, it is not worth the effort if you already have a Kindle Fire Original.Finally, given the above, I could not also justify buying an 8.9"" screen for the larger KFHD either. Buy an iPad instead if you want a bigger screen and easy email handling (yes, I have and use an iPad).For the convenience, I hope one day Amazon adds Text to Speech to the original KF, but til then my Kindle Keyboard keeps on keepin' on. Fine for me. The newer editions are (for me) a waste of time and money.REVIEW UPDATE:Even though I sent mine back, I decided to try one more time because I got a new one as gift. Because of continuing hardware problems, I am now on my 5th return of this item to Amazon (LOVE their customer service) by their request. KFHD #6 still has issues which cannot be resolved.NOTE WELL: MY REVIEW IS A COMPARISON OF THE NEW KFHD TO THE 1ST GEN KINDLE FIRE ONLY. Several comments to my review have been rude and mean, which has kept me from updating this review until now (Jan 2013).My 6th KFHD has solved the video color problem very well, but the previous 1,2,3,4,5 ones had speakers blow out when connected to a bluetooth device (ipod classic and an ipod touch). Bummer. I have not connected this one to a bluetooth speaker (Bose), nor will I in the future.STILL have email problems. Started using the paid email app which approximates the display of the amazon email app on the original KF. However, my ISP uses a Barracuda Spam Firewall Filter that sends an email for me to connect to my quarantined inbox to check if any emails need to go to the inbox rather than the quarantine box. The Barracuda link goes to a web page, but the web page only loads half-way and will NOT allow me to access the quarantine inbox. The old KF had no problem with this. None. The new one does not allow this function. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A BROWSER GLITCH ON THEIR PART AND THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF FIXING IT. 3 customer service agents have told me it is a known issue that Amazon will NOT solve. End of discussion. So if your ISP uses Barracuda, BEWARE.AS COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL FIRE, THIS ONE IS STILL A DISAPPOINTMENT for me. As for you, only you can decide.

B001ELJER4,electronics,How is the feature?,"Big complaint:  Garmin needs to trim the product line and concentrate on selling no more than 5 models at a time. It should discontinue the old models as soon as the new models come out.  And the model numbers are extremely confusing.  A model named 780 may actually be an older model and has fewer features than a 765T.  Many of those models differ by just a couple of features.The first unit I bought had a volume problem.  The sound occasionally went to inaudible levels on its own even when the volume was set to maximum (100%).  Then after a trip it would go back up to normal levels again.  Amazon exchanged that defective unit.The traffic rerouting feature really works.  On a stretch of freeway with highway construction, the routing function intelligently bypassed that section of the freeway using detours.  I love that feature.  I assume the feature is only as good as the accuracy of information relayed to the center that keeps track of traffic information.The lane assist feature has two modes: the photo-realistic mode and the highlighted lanes mode in the upper left corner of the screen.  The photo mode only works at a few major freeway interchanges in major metro areas, while the highlighted lanes mode works at a lot more places.  There is no need to press any button to activate either mode.  The photo-realistic screen just pops up for a few seconds on its own at the right moment.  Then it goes back to normal screen showing the highlighted lanes in the upper right corner of the screen when the critical moment is past.The FM broadcast feature works well. It broadcasts directions over the car radio, but I have to set the radio volume high to get decent volume.One big gripe, the turn announcements sometimes come too late, almost at the last minute.  Most of the long distance turn announcements come in three stages.  Example:  after you just finished a turn, it will immediately say, ""Drive 6 miles then turn right on Broadway"".  The second stage announcement is at either 0.1 miles or 0.2 miles: ""In 0.1 miles turn right on Broadway.""  Sometimes the secondary stage will say: ""In 0.2 miles turn right on Broadway.""  The third and last stage is at about 10 feet before the turn:  ""Turn right on Broadway.""  The problem is that the second stage warning at 0.1 mile before the turn is essentially a last minute announcement that is frequently only useful if you're already in the correct lane because 0.1 mile is about a half block length before the turn.  If you had kept on driving for most of the 6 miles in the wrong lane, you'd likely have forgotten that you should be on the right lane to get ready for the right turn.  Having only 0.1 miles of warning to change lane is sometimes very hard to do in busy city driving.Another major flaw is the unit gets very hot on hot summer days when it's plugged in and placed on the dashboard.  I use the bean bag mount on the dash and the unit gets very hot under the sun even when I am driving with the windows down.  The sun's rays heat it up, along with the fact that the electronics inside heats up on its own when plugged in.  The high temp is very bad for the longevity of the unit.  I may have to either build a sun shield or put white tape on the back of the unit to reflect sun light to keep it cool.  I would not be surprised if the some of the reports of premature malfunction mentioned by other reviewers and of the volume problem I mentioned earlier were due to heat damage.The ""Where Am I"" feature is great, particularly if you're almost out of gas and need the GPS to lead you to the nearest gas station fast.  It also shows the nearest police station and hospital.  It also tells you the nearest intersection and nearest street address, useful if your car breaks down in unfamiliar places and you need to call for emergency service.The MP3 player has about 2GB of free storage space. It can put out the sound in one of three modes:  internal speaker, earphone jack, or over the radio using the FM signal.  I didn't appreciate how nice it was having the MP3 feature until I realized that it's integrated with the GPS function, something that would not be true with your car radio. With GPS units that don't have MP3, one usually can't play music on the radio when the GPS is in operation(at least not loudly) because the radio would drown out the direction announcements from the GPS.  With the built-in MP3 on the 765T, I can play a whole album of MP3 songs while the unit operates in the GPS mode.  The driving directions announcements will override the music, so when it announces directions, the music stops temporarily and will resume once the direction announcements are over.  Very nice!Overall I love this unit.  Is it worth the premium over a 255W or 265T?  That depends on how much you value the lane assist and traffic info features and the MP3 feature.  I don't have Bluetooth devices and so can't comment on it. The lifetime (i.e. for the life of the unit, not of the buyer) Navteq traffic info subscription is worth $50 + the traffic antenna about $35.  So mostly the price difference between the 255/265 and the 765 is for the traffic feature, plus the MP3, bluetooth, lane assist, etc.  Are they worth the $100-$120 price difference?  I would tend to say so. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5262, 5276)"

Videos streamed from Amazon look really good.Book reading is surprisingly good for a backlit screen.  Page turns are quick and although they lack the book like ""charm"" of the Kindle reader page turns it is an acceptable substitute.Screen brightness is good and you can see the screen pretty well outdoors.  I have turned off automatic screen brightness though.  I find the values it chooses too bright in most cases and have mine set slightly less than 50%.CONS -No AC adapter included.  Would that have really been that much of a stretch to include?No flash support.  UPDATE: Well...no official flash support.  Thanks to the comment from TomT below I was able to install both flash and my preferred browser (Dolphin) in a few minutes.  Google Flash 11.1 apk and follow the xda developer links...will walk you right through it.  Now if I can get Google Voice working so I can use sonar I'll be a happy camper.  Have added a star since it was this easy.  That still doesn't negate the fact that it should have been included in the first place with so many sites still using Flash.The charge and HDMI ports are on the long edge rather than the short as is on my other Kindles (and the original Fire I believe).  When you want to do HDMI out to a TV you can only turn it one way if you want to tilt it up which may, depending on the case you buy,  totally defeat the stand in the case.  In the case of the Marware leather rotating case you can't close the case when charging because the ports are to the inside.Volume and On-Off buttons are flush with the case and almost impossible to find by feel.  Since the only visual cue for which way you are holding it is the camera lens this makes it difficult in a darkened room.No GPS.  This isn't a deal breaker, but would have been nice.  I suppose they thought since it needs wireless people wouldn't use it like that, but I could always turn on my phone's Mobile Hotspot to use Google maps IF I had a GPS.The ads.  I own other Kindles and have never felt the need to turn them off.  They were unobtrusive and didn't really affect my use of the device.  I even went for them occasionally.  The ones on the new Kindle are ridiculous.  Everywhere you turn they are in your face just waiting for an errant touch to purchase something you don't mean to and taking up screen space. People who care for children or the elderly should be extra vigilant for unintended purchases.Lack of many apps in the app store that I use daily on my Android phone and would use on the Kindle if they were there.  It's clear Amazon doesn't want to take any chances that you might stream something online that doesn't belong to them.  No TNT app, no USA app, no CW app.  I assume the others that I don't use like HBO and Showtime aren't there either?  No support for PowerDVD Remote and PowerDVD Mobile which would allow me to stream my own personal videos from my network rather than having to either upload them to the cloud or onto the device.  Can't access my Dropbox either.  I use my phone as a remote constantly when streaming from my HTPC to my TV and I was hoping I could use the Kindle that way too.Apps that work perfectly well on my phone throw error after error on the Kindle's ""special"" version. Examples: Words with Friends, no paid version and ads lock up the device.  Tweetcaster constantly throws the 350 connections per hour message and I am not a heavy user.  It throws this one when all I do is check it once in a while and have it set on manual refresh.  I ended up in Twitter Jail the first night I had the Kindle and I didn't tweet a single thing!  Never had this happen on my phone.Every app you download results in a ""purchase"" email from Amazon...even the free ones.  I have an avalanche of them in my inbox just from setting it up.  (Yes, I know this happens for phones as well.  I make the comment to point it out to those that don't know.  Amazon should have a better way worked out to handle this by now and since Kindle is part of their proprietary environment and since Kindle is a part of that this is part of owning one.)The Carousel? I hate it.  Everything goes on it as soon as you load or use it even if you don't want it to.  There may be a way to fine tune this, but if there is I haven't found it yet. I put a few favorite songs on the device for when I'm not near wireless and it showed each individual song on the Carousel. The UI is cluttered and as far as I can see there is no way to alter it to better serve your personal needs.  No way to clear the Carousel either.  You have to remove items one by one.  (If anyone knows how to change this please do let me know.)The main screen is obviously front loaded to get you to buy stuff..with the few things things that get around the spoon feeding of ads and buying stuff all the way to the right like photos and web.UPDATE:  I had not attempted to use the camera.  There is no software included to make use of the camera.  The User guide says you can download Skype and that it MAY work with other apps in the store, but there is no way to use it without downloading something and experimentation to see what apps might work with it.  Why include the camera if they aren't going to give you something to help use it?No alarm clock app included.  Now I know there are apps that will do this, but it's pretty much a basic inclusion on most mobile devices these days.Haven't decided if I will return or wait and hope Amazon offers some software updates that make it more acceptable.  It's a brilliant hardware upgrade hogtied by Amazon's watered-down version of Android and the lack of basic apps like camera/alarm that we have all come to expect.  I haven't tested the HDMI out yet, since my micro-HDMI cable hasn't arrived yet.  Will update this review next week when I get that. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6573, 6587)"

There are no indicator lights other than a somewhat distracting bright blue strip on the top that shows the power status.

B002C7481G,electronics,How is the processor?,"So I have had my iPad now for about a month. The bottom line for me is that the iPad has some strong points but, overall, is very limited in its usefulness. It might be well suited for someone in different circumstances but my scenario is that I have a small work laptop that is with me all day and I have a pocketable iPhone which is with me (almost) at all times. At home, I have the work laptop, another laptop and a desktop.Strengths* The iPad is a good digital photo frame. Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.Weaknesses* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a ""third device,"" not a replacement for one of your current devices.* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.So for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution.

B00093IIRA,electronics,Where do I place the button on the measurement pattern?,"As an ""early adopter"" and avid computer/home theatre user, but being on a teacher's budget, I've had to put up with 4-6 remotes for years. I tried to program the old Marantz RC2000, but my wife could never figure out how to use it. I bought an early Pronto, but gave up when it couldn't tell if my TV was already on when I switched from cable to VCR, turning off the TV--and my wife couldn't figure it out. Several years ago, I bought a Harmony, the model number escapes me, but the screen was on the bottom and I had to scroll through menus, etc. It didn't do it for me either--and my wife couldn't figure it out.Finally, I began to search the net to see if things had improved since 2003. I ran across the Harmony ""One"" in a ""First Look"" from the CES and it seemed like it might be the ticket. The 880 came up as a good alternative when the ""One"" hadn't been released yet. I figured I'd order the 880 from Amazon, see if it worked. If it didn't, I'd send it back within the 30 days and order the ""One"".The 880 is great! I received it, logged on, set it up with all my components (Sony 52"" XBR4 LCD TV, Sony STR-DA5200ES receiver, DirecTv HR-20 HD DVR/Receiver, XBox 360 w/HD DVD drive (by the way, during the setup, the website asked me if my XBox 360 was standalone or had the HD-DVD drive as well--a real surprise), and a couple of other VCR/DVD/CD players/recorders), and have been having fun tweaking it the past 2 days. I did not experience any of the difficulties described in some of the other reviews. It sits in the cradle perfectly. The buttons are smaller than some remotes, but it makes it easy to reach most of them with my thumb holding it in one hand. I'm a big guy with a big hand. I don't like the numbers on the bottom, but something has to be on the bottom, and I use the numbers less often than the volume, channel up/down, mute, previous, joystick and transport keys.Before I ordered it, I wondered if it would have all the keys for my DVR without going through a hierarchy of menus. It has everything right on top, even a ""List"" soft button on the LCD readout when in ""Watch DirecTv"" activity. Pushing ""List"" shows me the programs I've recorded, and using the joystick allows me to select or delete just as the DirecTv remote does. Perfect.You can change the ""Activity"" names, such as from the default ""Watch PVR"" to ""Watch DirecTv""; you can do away with cute icons behind each activity if it seems cluttery; in short, it's doing its job.I will keep the original remotes available for some of the really esoteric commands I might use occasionally. The 880 probably will do all those things through its menus, but I use them so seldom that it just isn't an issue.And my wife loves it!! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2709, 2723)"
B002NEGTTW,electronics,How is the learn curve?,"The EOS 7D, Canon's latest prosumer digital SLR, is a major step forward, incorporating some features found on the 5D Mark II, as well as some that are totally new to Canon's prosumer line.  With much that is new, even those familiar with Canon SLR's, should be prepared to spend some time frequently consulting the often confusing manual.Looking to upgrade from the 40D, I passed on the 5D Mark II, because its 3.9 frames per second shooting rate is inadequate for shooting sports.  With the new features and a shooting rate of 8 FPS, the 7D was my choice.  These are some early impressions of the 7D.Housing, Controls and Display:The 7D's heavy-duty, dust and weather resistant housing, is made of lightweight magnesium, and feels rock solid.  The 7D has a new arrangement of controls for users to get familiar with.  The mode dial is similar to the 5D Mark II (no 'Sports', 'Portrait, 'Landscape', etc).  The power switch has been relocated to behind the mode dial.  The video recording button is on the back, located on the right side of the eyepiece, similar to Canon's 'S' series cameras.  Shutter noise is quiet, similar to the 40D.  Image quality and color rendition on the LCD display is good, and looks similar to the 40D.  The display brightness can be set manually, or the camera will adjust it automatically.Pressing the 'Q' button activates the 'Quick Control Screen', a menu where a number of settings can be conveniently adjusted.  The joystick is used to toggle between functions, and settings are adjusted the normal way, using the Main and Quick Control dials.  Once you get used to it, the 'Q Menu' may become your preferred method for adjusting your settings.Autofocus:As I find that Canon's nine point focusing pattern is often inadequate, the 7D's improved autofocusing system was of special interest.  For those unfamiliar, the AF pattern is eight points in a diamond shaped layout with the ninth point in the middle of the diamond.  The new 19 point adjustable autofocus system basically adds points in the interior of the diamond area.  The actual area of coverage, does not appear to have increased.  Being center weighted is understandable, but expansion beyond the diamond area is arguably more useful than just increasing the number of focus points within the diamond area.The rule of thirds is a useful guide for composing an image, however attempting to implement this rule using the diamond shaped pattern is often difficult.  Say you want to focus on something in the top left quadrant of the frame.  One method is to lock focus on the area, reframe, and then shoot.  This works if the subject is stationary, however this method becomes more problematic for moving subjects.  If only there was a focus point nearby.  Increasing the concentration in the central area makes some sense, but I really wish they had expanded the overall area of autofocus coverage as well.That issue aside, performance of the new autofocus system appears to be a big improvement over the 40D and 50D.  The 19 individual points, are also grouped into 5 multipoint zones, which can be selected using  the Zone AF function.  This feature is very useful for many applications, like sports or group shots.  Shooting college basketball, focus lock using Zone AF was very good, much superior to single point focus.  The high speed continuous shooting mode (8 FPS) is smooth like butter.  The shutter button quite sensitive, but keeping the camera steady in burst mode takes practice.Remote Triggering and Wireless Flash:A very convenient feature that was a long time coming to Canon's prosumer line, is the ability to remotely trigger the 7D using Canon's RC-1 remote, or other inexpensive remotes.  The 7D can also be triggered by Pocket Wizards, via the N3 terminal.  The integral flash is essential, and the 7D also has the capability to wirelessly trigger compatible Canon speedlights, eliminating the need for the ST-E2 transmitter, and makes creative flash photography more convenient.Live View, Video, and Memory:Photography via live view mode, is similar to a point and shoot, although the 7D is a little heavy to be holding in front of your face.  As claimed by Canon, the image taken seems to be 100% of what appears in the LCD display.  I use live view for rough framing when the camera is on a tripod.  For HD video a fast card is a must, Canon recommends using a CF card with a transfer rate of 8MB/second.  Shooting video is simple, though the results can be kind of spotty.  Check YouTube for video reviews of the 7D, and examples of videos shot with the 7D.  Picture quality can be quite good, although skin tones may not be accurate, and AF is not continuous.  You will need ample memory to shoot video, as a 4GB card holds about 12 minutes of content.  For images at highest image quality (RAW + JPEG), the camera reads that a 32 GB card will hold about 960 images, an 8 GB card about 240, and a 4 GB card about 125.ISO:As the 40D tops off at ISO 1600, the 7D's ability to shoot up to ISO 6400 is mind-blowing.  The noise in test shots at ISO 4000 and above, were not bad.  I rarely exceed ISO 800, but it is something I will now look into further.LP-E6 Battery:Canon's LP-E6 batteries have a serial number, and the 7D will keep track of the battery's power level, and number of shots taken.  Canon continues to take measures to discourage the use of third party products.  Non-Canon versions of the LP-E6 battery will work in the 7D, but are not recognized, and read as `empty' on the battery meter, with no data available.  Having used non-Canon BP-511 batteries for years in various Canon SLR's, without any problems, I do not believe that they are inferior or dangerous.  You can pay $60 for the Canon LP-E6 if you wish, but you can get generic LP-E6 batteries for as low as $10.In these hard economic times, value and quality are even more important.  The 7D does cost more than the 40D and 50D when they debuted, but it is worth it.  The 7D is better built, has many more standard features, and produces better images.  It appears that Canon is very serious about competing with Nikon, which should benefit users of both brands.  It will take some time for most users to begin tap into the potential this camera offers.  Have fun taking some great images. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6285, 6299)"

I checked all the router settings as it was suggested by the installer, even reseted my router, but to no avail. After going though all forums and troubleshooting pages, I realized that the firewall on my Macbook Pro is on, and that's the reason. When I disabled the firewall, it was set up in no time.But things got better after that grueling installing experience. I have hooked the Chromecast up to my LG 39LN5300, and it works (almost) perfectly. I use it to watch youtube, Netflix, or to stream (some) online videos using VidCast bookmarklet. From time to time, it doesn't work, but a simple reload of the chrome page almost always solves the problem. I also tried tab-casting, but it's not something to write home about. You can cast The Daily Show, or Colbert Report, but it only runs (almost) smoothly at 480p, and it takes a lot of CPU and RAM (you can hear the fan on Macbook Pro going crazy). The good thing though is that it also casts the audio to the tv. To be fair, this option is still in beta version, so hopefully it will get better with time.What is exciting about Chromecast is that Google recently released the SDK for developers, and they are doing a great job coming up with cool ideas (check out AllCast, for instance).

B005DKZTMG,electronics,Is it a wireless keyboard?,"Edit: After being completely disgusted about the right shift key location, I searched for key-remapping options.  SharpKeys is a quick-and-easy solution for Windoze 2000/XP/7/8.  Make sure you download it from the author's website as the first two installers I downloaded (from sites I had considered trustworthy) were full of bloatware.  Once installed, I swapped the mapping of the up-arrow and right shift keys on my K400 and wow what a difference.  I'm actually pretty happy with this keyboard after this fix.  I would increase the rating to 4 stars, but the credit goes to randyrants_dot_com for the software, not Logitech.  The only downside with this fix is that it swaps the keys in the OS, so if you plug in another keyboard the up-arrow and right shift will be swapped on that too.  And if you VNC or Remote Desktop you will likely experience the same problem there.The only unfortunate thing with this finding is that there are so many reviews of this keyboard it's not likely that many existing owners will see this fix.Original Review:The K400 is a decent wireless keyboard.  The layout is pretty good given the small format.  The tactile feedback is good.  The battery life, so far, has been pretty good.  I've only had the keyboard for 2 months but just discovered the on/off switch, so I'm fairly impressed the battery has lasted this long (although it may also have an auto-off power save feature).  The range is just okay.  The spec indicates > 30', but my couch is just 10' from my PC in my media center and if I'm reclined or have my legs up a bit it tends to block the transmission.  If I have the media cabinet door closed the range is only a few feet at best.Despite these few short comings, this would be a nearly 5-star product save the one fatal flaw -- the location of the right shift key.  If you look at the right shift key on any well-used keyboard you'll generally see a shiny spot on the left side - where most people strike the key.  Logitech, a company which typically puts out some good, smart products, blew this one.  They put the up-arrow key in this location, making a skinny little shift key to the left of the up-arrow.  After two months of use I still up-arrow virtually every time I try to use the left shift key.  It drives me nuts and and is the reason for the 2-star review.  I have no earthly idea what they were thinking, I can only assume they never actually tested it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2419, 2433)"

B005CLPP84,electronics,What are  the different uses of this item?,"We have the 1st gen Roku and now the Roku 2 XS. We enjoy all it has to offer so much that we plan to cut our cable TV provider out of the loop at the end of the month. With Roku's ability to stream from sources like Netflix and Hulu Plus, we have our fill of TV episodes, and there are plenty of movie sources too.In this market, none of the selections are perfect at this point. Some competitors don't offer Hulu Plus, some are difficult to use and setup, some come and go within a few weeks. And the Roku is no exception. It has a few issues too.We run into a few stutters and freezes every once in a while - including the Roku box crashing and resetting. This is probably the channels themselves, but it is still a pain.While the interface is clean and user friendly, it could probably use a facelift to speed it up. Instead of apps all being on one line, it would be nice if they were placed on rows. My channel list is growing. In addition, many apps would benefit from a keyboard capability on the remote. Fortunately, the iPhone apps can provide this capability in some cases. But having it built into the Roku and remote would be nice.The only major disappointing issue is the lack of streaming from DLNA or network shares. You can plug a USB drive in, but you can't just stream from a share on the same network. Why not? Seems that Roku would have taken all the begging from customers into consideration and added such a feature. Many of their competitors offer the feature. There are a few workarounds, but they are a pain in the rear to setup and don't work as well as they could.Hopefully the Roku firmware can and will be updated to accept more filetypes and to support the network drives. But there is no telling at this point.But with those issues noted, the Roku was still the best bet compared to the competitors. At least for us. Hulu Plus is a big draw since many of the shows we like are on it (and many of the competing products that have the ""extras""we want, don't offer Hulu PLus). The simplicity is a necessity. It's nice that the Roku uses very little power consumption. And the abundance of channels is great.In addition, the kids enjoy the game capabilities, but I don't think it will be replacing our game consoles any time soon.Overall, we are very pleased with the Roku and will be getting rid of our cable TV provider in favor of the streaming apps in the Roku device. We just hope they keep improving their device, and listen to their customers. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2478, 2492)"

B003GIJTR8,electronics,How is the earphone?,"Note:  These have an excellent, no-hassle warranty.  Skullcandy will replace them for any reason, whenever - just go to their website, register your product, and fill out the warranty form.  You will receive CREDIT for their website that you can use on whatever you like, as well as free shipping.  The amount of credit will depend upon the current price of your product on THEIR website - so for the standard INK'D buds, you will get a $20 credit.  You do not need any proof of purchase, and it does not matter how much time has passed - just pop the broken buds into a small envelope and you're good.Firstly, I want to mention a few important tidbits that you should know.1.  Pay attention to the L and R (engraved on the stem) on these earbuds, which can be hard to see.  Do not reverse them, as doing so can affect fit and sound quality.  I find putting a piece of colored tape on the right cord makes life easier.2.  Don't assume you know which gel size will fit you best; make sure you try on all 3 gel sizes that come with these, as using the wrong size can dramatically decrease sound quality and comfort.  If your earbuds are uncomfortable or the sound quality does not meet your expectations, then you likely have the wrong size gel installed.  For myself, I automatically went with the smallest size because my ears are small, but those made the earbuds sound like cheap garbage.  It wasn't until I tried the next size up did I get the full quality of sound that these are designed for.  So pay attention to this, since it really matters.3.  These have a straight plug, not an L-shaped plug.  So you will need to be extra careful as a straight-plug design increases the amount of pressure both on the plug, and the headphone jack of your player.  This leads to frayed wires or a loosening of the headphone jack, or both, which ultimately lead to the classic problem of only one side having sound.4.  The cord is long - measures approximately 4 feet, 5 inches.5.  Burn-in works with these.  Slightly.Now, as for the build quality - I'm impressed.  They are not cheaply made earbuds, despite their low price.  The wires are nice and solid, and feel very well made - not flimsy or plastic-y.  The silicone gels (tips that go in your ear) are very soft and pliable, and even have the Skullcandy logo engraved on them.  Nice touch.They feel good, too.  Really good.  Both the material, and the way they fit my annoyingly small ears.  And they don't fall out constantly, although I do sometimes get the sensation that it's getting sucked into my left ear.And yes, these come with 3 different size gels.Sound is great.  These handle bass extremely well for mid-tier earbuds, and highs aren't so shrill and piercing as with other comparable brands.  Some of this really depends on your player, too.  Even between iPods, sound quality does differ.As far as functionality goes, I find I am able to run with these with no problem.  The wires do not get tangled, and you can easily adjust the split in them with an attached slider (that has 'Skullcandy' written on it in the corresponding colour), which I find very convenient.  I do not hear this thumping sound that others claim to hear from wire-movement, so I can't confirm that.The only things I dislike are the straight plug, and the lack of a case.  Otherwise, I am thoroughly impressed with Skullcandy.  The craftsmanship, the quality of sound, and all the little extras that Skullcandy does that really lets you know that they are paying attention, and that they care about their products and end-users.Worth every penny.UPDATE 12/31/2011 - My current pair has seen daily use for over a year now with no issues.

B007PRHNHO,electronics,How is it feel ?,"I'm actually writing this review with this keyboard and it only reminds me how great this keyboard is. I had purchased the Apple bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad but stopped using it after some time due to having to carry it around separately. I recently purchased the 4th generation iPad and saw this keyboard thanks to a banner ad from Amazon. I decided to give it a try.First, the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. Very easy to type and great feedback. The best feature of the keyboard has to be that it doubles as a smart case so no more carrying around a &#34;separate&#34; keyboard. It protects your iPad and attaches very nicely to it. Simply open this keyboard cover on the iPad and it slides nicely into the middle of the keyboard. It displays the iPad at a great angle for reading and fits pretty securely into the slot. The slot also seems to have a magnetic connection to it to hold the iPad more securely as well.Connecting the keyboard via bluetooth is of course very simple. It also has an on/off switch which is nice for battery preservation. It's also a better switch than what Apple's had where I couldn't easily tell if the keyboard was on/off.The keyboard charges with a standard (yes standard) USB mini connection. The cable that comes with the keyboard only hooks up to a USB port on say a computer and not a wall adapter but that was ok for me. The cable is also VERY short. But that was ok for me because I have simply been using a different USB mini power cable that plugs into the wall that I use to charge my bluetooth headset for my phone. One less charger to carry around. Also, so far the keyboard seems to hold a charge for a LONG time. I haven't run out of battery yet nor even seen the low battery indicator the keyboard claims to have. I've gone 7 days without charging and it's been fine. Now during that time I wasn't using it all day but still...I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard. The feel of the keyboard is awesome, the fact that it connects so well to iPad as a Smartcase makes it like you aren't even carrying a keyboard, and it adds protection to your iPad screen.

B008RDI0TU,electronics,How was the key?,"I am always looking for a keyboard that is easy to use, types as a keyboard is supposed to type and is easily transportable.  I have had three keyboards.  First was the Apple keyboard and as great as it is, it definitely is not easily transportable.  Best kept in a stationary location.  I also have a recently purchased keyboard that folds up.  Meets the test of transportability, but quite frankly doesn't feel comfortable and has certain awkward key locations.  The other keyboard I purchased was for my original IPad and it attached to make a nice package to carry around.  However, the weak part for me was that the keyboard never felt comfortable, Keys were cramped.  Not that easy to type on.  I found the ad for this product and couldn't resist the purchase.  Turns out to be a hands down winner.  Looks and feels as a keyboard  should. Very solid feel to it.  Came neatly packaged in a neoprene carry pouch with a charging cable, albeit a bit short in length.  Was very easy to link via Bluetooth to my iPad and manages to stay linked each time I begin to use it.  The keyboard layout was perfect.  The keys really look and act as keyboard keys should.  Far superior for me than most of the other keyboards I have used.  Have not had the keyboard long enough to comment on battery life, but charging is rather simple, so not an issue.  Lastly, really meets the test of transportability as it easily attaches to my new iPad.  Attaching the keyboard to the iPad when carrying it is a cinch as is removing it for use.  The neoprene carrypouch fits the ipad and keyboard thus acting as a protective cover when carrying it around.  There are many ways to set it up.  I will leave that up to you to find the one that works best for you.  I had great fun typing this review using features to cut, paste, etc.If you have need for a really neat and efficient keyboard that is both useful when left in a stationary location or easily transportable as a single unit with your iPad then this is the one for you.

If you find a make/model that runs reliably, you love that make/model.  If you have a bad experience (or two, or three) with a make/model, you hate that make/model.  That said, Seagate hasn't failed me over the years.  So I love this hard drive.Background:  We're moving into a blended, Apple-Microsoft home, as are many other families these days.  It starts maybe with an Apple iPod, then iPod Touch, then an iPhone, then you start eyeing those sleek Macs at the Apple store, and then....  But we're not ready to move to an all-Apple home anytime soon.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to move data back-and-forth between those two environments when you're dealing with lots of files?What I appreciate about this Seagate is the Windows driver that Seagate provides on their website to allow you to connect this ready-for-Mac hard drive to any Windows computer.  Google ""Seagate crossplatform"" to find the Windows driver to use this Seagate on a Windows machine.  Note, though, that whenever I connect this drive to Windows, it throws the warning, ""Do you want to scan and fix Seagate Backup Plus Drive?""

B0044YU60M,electronics,How is the configuration?,"I purchased this router a couple months ago to replace my aging ZyXel X-550 Xtreme MIMO routher (which is still working fine for the most part).  I finally got around to installing it yesterday.  My initial impressions were not great, to be honest.  The build quality doesn't seem great - mostly lightweight plastic, and the unit is so small and light that the two cables coming out of the back keep the unit from sitting flat on the back of my computer armoire.  I'm OK with that as long as the unit proves to last a long time with few or no reboots needed. It is too early to tell, so I will try to update this review a few months down the road.My next issue with the router came immediately after I finished the setup.  Minutes before unplugging my ZyXel router, I had a reliable network connection on my desktop computer, which has a wired connection to the router.  Upon booting up the Medialink router, I had no network connection and could not even access the router directly through my browser.  I meticulously went through the setup instructions 3 more times, being careful to unplug everything in just the right order.  Still no luck.  I then tried a wireless connection and discovered that did work.  I was able to finish the router setup wirelessly.  I then tried a wired connection from my notebook, and that also worked.  So the router itself seemed to be working fine EXCEPT that I was unable to access it from my desktop, which is a critical need.  I contacted Medialink by email but did not hear back from them quickly so called them.  The initial tech was unable to help. An hour or two later, a level 2 tech called me back and was also unable to help, suggesting that it was a hardware or software issue on my computer.  I then spent 3 hours on the phone with a Dell tech, which was a huge waste of time.  I also submitted questions on a handful of forum sites.  At 11pm, after 14 hours of trying to get this router to work, I tried plugging in the old router, and within minutes I had a working connection again.  Frustrated, I gave up on the new router and went to bed.  This morning, I spent another couple hours doing some troubleshooting before contacting Medialink again by email.  After some time with no response, I called and was told that someone would call me back.  They didn't, but they did respond to my email.  With the new info I provided, they were able to suggest that I wirelessly access the router to change the default IP address from 192.168.0.1 to what my old router had been using (192.168.10.1), then reboot the router.  That worked!  If anyone runs into a similar issue, be sure to give this a shot.  You can change the default IP address by going to Advanced Settings --> LAN Settings on the router.I'm not a hardcore geek, but I'm comfortable with technical things so I was not real happy that I had to invest so much time getting the router to work, nor was I happy about how many emails & phone calls to/from Medialink I had to invest in to get it working.  And I was slightly disappointed in how Medialink came across in their support; I just didn't feel that they were eager & willing to go the distance in helping me resolve this.  HOWEVER, to their credit, they did respond in a reasonably timely fashion, and they did eventually come through with the solution I needed (albeit because I was willing to invest the time & effort to narrow the issues down on my own, something others might not be able or willing to do).In hindsight, I would have gone with a router with a better reputation behind it that offered some additional features, better build quality, and tech support that is able to resolve issues more quickly.  However, for the price, this seems to be a decent router.  I am using 1 wired connection and several wireless devices, and the speed and reliability thus far seem great.  Others have obviously had great success with this, so as long as it continues to work well for me, I have no problems recommending it as a budget router. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4001, 4015)"

Yes she is 8 and its an extream gift, but we knew she would use it and take care of it. The tablet is made really well with a great feel to it. If it wasnt for an 8 year old i would not have bought a case for it, it just has that good of a feel to it.  I chose this tablet because it was for a child and i know there is only so much she would need it for. Mostly entertainment. Yes it is, in a sence, a way for amazon to get you to buy from them all kinds of media, but im happy with that. I love amazon. Everybody in the family knew she was receiving this for christmas so it made it easy for them to buy a gift card to excatly the place she would want one to. On a parent note...i chose this tablet for 2 deciding factors. One: its user friendly. I didnt have to spend an hour trying to figure out how to operate it. It came registered to my amazon account, and when i wanted to put my daughters name on the kindle instead of the name it came registered to ( mine) it was a snap. And those types of things usually take me forever to figure out. Everything on this device is very simple to use. I was worried how to swap things in and out of the cloud before i received it, but that also is so easy. You dont even have to think about it. Its plainly there and explains itself. So for anybody that wants a tablet but struggles with electronics and how to make them work right, this is for you. I wish all devices were this easy. The second deciding factor for me was the parental controls. And im not even using the free time feature. That adds even greater saftey and control even over how long your kids are allowed on it. But just from the standard functions i was able to set a passcode for turning wifi on, im able to block anything i want without locking everything as a whole. I can block just movies, or just the web, so thats why i went with the kindle,its the tablet she asked for, but it was a great choice. The ease of use and the great parental controls the other tablets didnt offer. The picture qualty is amazing, as well as the sound. They are not lying when they say these features are great. So this is just my 2 cents on my thoughts on this device for our 8 year old.

I have hooked the Chromecast up to my LG 39LN5300, and it works (almost) perfectly. I use it to watch youtube, Netflix, or to stream (some) online videos using VidCast bookmarklet. From time to time, it doesn't work, but a simple reload of the chrome page almost always solves the problem. I also tried tab-casting, but it's not something to write home about. You can cast The Daily Show, or Colbert Report, but it only runs (almost) smoothly at 480p, and it takes a lot of CPU and RAM (you can hear the fan on Macbook Pro going crazy). The good thing though is that it also casts the audio to the tv. To be fair, this option is still in beta version, so hopefully it will get better with time.What is exciting about Chromecast is that Google recently released the SDK for developers, and they are doing a great job coming up with cool ideas (check out AllCast, for instance). This is what sets apart Chromecast from Apple TV and Roku. I hope Amazon also releases its own app for Chromecast some time soon. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1498, 1512)"

B00829TIEK,electronics,How is the value of this package?,"QUICK SUMMARY:  People tend to have a love/hate relationship with hard drives.  If you find a make/model that runs reliably, you love that make/model.  If you have a bad experience (or two, or three) with a make/model, you hate that make/model.  That said, Seagate hasn't failed me over the years.  So I love this hard drive.Background:  We're moving into a blended, Apple-Microsoft home, as are many other families these days.  It starts maybe with an Apple iPod, then iPod Touch, then an iPhone, then you start eyeing those sleek Macs at the Apple store, and then....  But we're not ready to move to an all-Apple home anytime soon.  Wouldn't it be nice to be able to move data back-and-forth between those two environments when you're dealing with lots of files?What I appreciate about this Seagate is the Windows driver that Seagate provides on their website to allow you to connect this ready-for-Mac hard drive to any Windows computer.  Google ""Seagate crossplatform"" to find the Windows driver to use this Seagate on a Windows machine.  Note, though, that whenever I connect this drive to Windows, it throws the warning, ""Do you want to scan and fix Seagate Backup Plus Drive?""  If you click Yes, nothing happens -- no apparent way to get rid of this message.  That doesn't appear to affect the ability to read/write to the drive using Windows, though.Speed and performance seemed good.  Using a 1.7GB test directory, I got 24MB/sec write, and 38MB/sec read using USB 2.0.CONCLUSION:  I love Seagate...until this or another Seagate drive fails me.

B004E10KFG,electronics,Is the unit very compact?,"I never imagined I would spend $200 on a tiny wireless speaker system but the rave review by David Pogue in the New York Times swayed me to splurge.It was delivered in about 36 hours to my door. BUT after spending frustrating hours trying to get it to work - software downloads from the Jawbone website and phone support from their eager staff - it was decided that the unit was defective and should be returned. Unhappy, I persuaded them to ship the replacement unit overnight. Jawbone will not pay for return shipping of a defective unit or provide a shipping label, believe it or not for such a pricey purchase, so I add another $10 to the $200 I already paid. So I only rate the Jambox as four stars because they have a quality control problem and a mean-spirited return policy for their stupid defective units.Now, happily with minimal effort as I already had the required software loaded, the tiny unit can play music streamed via Bluetooth from both my iPhone and iPad anywhere in my apartment without the unit being anywhere near them. As David Pogue said - ""Magic!"" AND it also acts as a cell phone answerer and speakerphone with built-in microphone. When the unit is on it will automatically silence the speakers on my iPhone or iPad and hold this stream if a phone call comes in at the same time. The sound quality is much better than I expected from a palm-sized 12oz gadget. I can walk around the house taking it from room to room as I do other things and listen at the same time to my music. I can watch videos and streaming movies on my iPhone or iPad with great big sound instead of tinny little sound from the mini-speakers in the devices. Somehow this big sound makes the videos seem much more compelling to watch. I can hear no buzzing, hissing or other wireless interference so the sound is completely clean to listen to classical music.Pressing a button on top of the unit brings a voice that tells you how much battery life is left. It is claimed to play for 10 hours before needing re-charge but I haven't yet tested this.I can imagine taking this with me on car journeys to listen to music on my iPhone and answer phone calls on the road with just the press of one button and no driving distraction.

With that said, the G10 is closer.I have been shooting digital for 10+ years.  That makes me a bit of a dinosaur.  I have been in love with photography and camera equipment for 50+ years.  I expect that in the next 10 years the technology will get better and the G10's successor will handle noise better then this model.  Until that happens, I will shoot at no higher then 400iso (in film days that was very fast) and use Nik Define 2.0 to get rid of the noise.I was going to give the G10 a 4 but raised it to a 5 based on a comparison with other P+S cams rather then trying to compare it with a DSLR.  This camera is at the top of the heap of the P+S (along with 1 or 2 others).

It is extremely sharp and fast and a pleasure to use.  Putting this lens on my D3100 has made that camera come alive.  It is significantly sharper, faster and better built than the kit 18-55 lens.

I have other Transcend SD cards in smaller sizes and those work great too. The price on this card is definitely better than I could find for other brands of the same size, as well.Update (07/13/12):I found a problem with this card if you're using it in a DSLR for video. I have a Canon T3i and when I shoot video sometimes (well, probably more than half of the time) it will stop recording either within seconds of hitting record or a couple minutes later. I did a search online and what it seems to be is when you go back through your card and delete certain photos or videos that aren't at the end of the sequence it leaves gaps in the memory, then when you record a video it tries to fill those gaps before continuing at the end of the memory card. Basically, I have to save everything to my computer and format my memory card while it's in my camera before doing any video shoots to make sure this doesn't happen. It seems to work fine if I do that. In theory, if you don't delete anything that's not at the end of the number sequence, it should work fine as long as you have room, but I don't always look at each picture and decide whether or not to delete it before taking another. I have read that this isn't an issue with some other brands like San Disk, but haven't tried for myself.

It's been okay so far.Any prospective buyer should be aware of the following before making the purchase:- Definitely meant for travel and laptops, less suitable on one's desk or desktop machines (see below).- The cord is VERY short. This is an issue with desktops. I suppose it's possible to plug the hub in and leave it hanging off the front or the back of a desktop computer but it's not something that I would do.- Related to the above, it is not a fashion statement. The hub is functional and allows 4 USB devices to be plugged into it but it is not likely to win any design award. I mention this because, with the chord being as short as it is, the likely space this hub will occupy is on your desk.- It is not powered. As such, do not plan to use it with (more than one) USB-powered hard drives. It should be okay if the drives use their own power supply.- It does not have many blinking lights like some other hubs do.

B009X3UW2G,electronics,How mano hours do you think is the battery life?,"Updated News as of November 2013:Google has released specifications for the Second Generation Nexus 7 with the release date on July 30th 2013. Resolution has been bumped up to 1920x1200 (323 PPI!), a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (sorry, no S8) quad core processor clocking in at 1.5 GHz (vs the 1.3 Tegra 3 on the First Gen Nexus), 2 gigs of RAM, 4 times as powerful graphics chip, and a 5 megapixel back camera. Cnet is reporting that the Second Gen will have HDMI out capabilities from its micro usb port, thus implying the MHL protocols which were missing on the first generation are enabled on the Second Gen thus letting you plug your tablet into your TV to watch movies. The tablet is a bit lighter and a bit thinner than the first generation as well. Also ships with Android 4.3, the newest version. The dimpled back that so many people loved is gone replaced with a smooth surface.  Still no Gorilla Glass, but now includes Dual Band Wifi and stereo speakers. Battery capacity appears to have been decreased about 400 mAh most likely to fit inside the thinner case.Unfortunately, the price has increased. 16gb for $229, 32gb for $269 and the new LTE enabled model for $349. Unlike the First Gen series (which you are looking at), the cellular options now include Verizon in addition to the original GSM based AT&T; and T-Mobile. Sprint still out of luck. As always, sold unlocked. Due to the new release, the First Gen is likely to see significant price decreases.USB Hosting and USB OTG still works on the Nexus 7 2nd Generation.If you're on a budget, the Nexus 7 (2012) is an excellent choice, but for $229 the Nexus 7 2nd generation also known as the Nexus 7 (2013) is a superior product. Much better processor, better graphics, better screen and lighter.End of Update.I've had the Nexus 7 8gb since Late August. I'll share some of my experience as well as pitfalls. The 8/16/32 Gb are functionally identical abet with a few minor difference between them, largely being the size capacities. There is also a 3G cellular version for $300 on Google Play. Remember that currently Amazon is NOT selling the Nexus 7 itself, but merely providing 3rd Party sellers a place to sell it. Occasionally Amazon takes care of the shipping, but this is not an Amazon company product. It will be cheaper elsewhere.The 32 GB version was released on October 29th, 2012. The 8 GB version was discontinued and the 16 GB version dropped $50 in price. The 3G cellular version went on sale on November 13, 2012 only on T-Mobile and AT&T; networks for $300 big ones.A few things key to know about the 32 GB version:Flash memory works faster the more there is up to a plateau of around 480 GBs. Benchmarks on the 32 GB Nexus 7 show a slight improvement in speed in most activities. Meaning, despite having the same parts of its smaller sized brethren, the 32 GB will see a few seconds shaved off in terms of performance. The Nexus 7 8/16 versions were plenty fast already.Asus should have fixed many of the defects that plagued the early releases from screen separation, light bleed, bad audio plugs, etc. Sometimes it pays to wait for technology.Not all 32 GB are free for the user. Based on the previous models, you should have around 28 to 29 GB of empty space available.Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8/16/32gb (the three flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.It's called USB On The Go. You take a USB OTG cable (like $1 here or on eBay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16/32 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.Kickstarter recently funded a MicroUSB MicroSD reader which will allow owners of certain devices (including the Nexus 7) to access MicroSD Cards. Google ""Meenova.com"" for more information about when they are going to be released for the general public. This will function the same as an OTG Cable, but instead let you access MicroSD rather than USB Flash drives.If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Also be aware that apps that move other apps to SD cards in other tablets will not work with this. Apps such as App 2 SD don't do anything. I tried.As of today (11/19/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iPod Touch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 32 gb flash drive, a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad.Speaking of that issue: Game controllers and utilities such as Sixaxis and Stickmount (among other apps) require rooting. To those who are unsure of what rooting is, rooting grants the user access to the most bottom command line access of a device. Be aware this voids your warranty, risks turning your device into a very expensive paperweight and prevents auto updating of updates over the air. I learned this the hard way. Search on the XDA developer's website how to root, but research how to do it before attempting. There are benefits and disadvantages of rooting. Make sure that you know exactly why you are rooting.One CAVEAT to this, you have to use digital rights management free media. Mp3s are generally fine as iTunes is now selling DRM free as is Amazon. Direct downloaded movies are another story. You can also rip legitimately owned DVDs and downsize them for the Nexus. Those will play fine. Also, using other media players like DICE or BSPlayer will let you play formats that the Google Video Player doesn't like, like MKV or MTS.2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad 3 or 4 or a Nook HD (which by the way is gloriously beautiful). It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not take that-iPad well done, but save yourself lots of cash well done. It's fairly responsive, not quite iPad responsive, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. I honestly don't think people will notice the difference between the two in sharpness and text, but it is not as good in showing colors. That said, the Nexus 7 has a better screen then the iPad Mini. Go to your local Apple store, look at the iPad 4s and then the Mini. Prepare to be shocked. It's that noticeable.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixels is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app. One cool thing about the camera is that it does allow Face Unlock which takes a picture of your face and uses it as the unlocking mechanism for your tablet.4) Apps. The Apple ecosystem has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like Skype, Facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store via going to the Amazon App Store, registering your email and then opening the email they send you on your tablet. It's annoying but it works. One word of caution on the Apple selling point: according to a few studies, something like 60% of all apps on iTunes (roughly 400,000) have never been downloaded which gels with the economic data showing only a relatively few app developers actually make any money.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wi-fi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google ""Install Flash On Nexus 7""The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7. Flash is being phased out entirely by Adobe. It's not pretty on the nexus 7 but you can get it to work, especially if you need to stream Amazon movies.7) No home screen rotating - Not true! Update 4.1.1 fixed this. Home screen rotates now!Now on to other things:Performance:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network dead zones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn'tOh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.Operating System:Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with). Jelly Bean is more smooth than iOS 5/6 on my Nexus 4 though. Hardware seems to be the difference.The most recent update 4.2 allows multiple users accounts on the tablet (same as Nook HD) and 4.3 has added types of accounts, both full and limited. Limited allows a limited account to share the apps of a full user, thus eliminating the problem of having to buy apps multiple times. A limited account can also be limited in what apps are shared thus giving users some form of parental controls.Because this is a Nexus device, Google is pushing out updates regularly and you don't have the problem that many Android phones have in their carrier refuses to release updates. You'll have the most recent update of Google for the foreseeable future.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10"" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like ""do I need an umbrella today?"" Ask ""Weather forecast (your location).""Also Google Voice does not have the witty banter of Siri. For instance, asking Siri ""what are you wearing"" gets her to say ""Why do people keep asking me that?"" Google Voice doesn't do that kind of funny stuff.GPS & Directions:Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the ""NAvFree USA"" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying ""in 100 meters, turn right."" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Other:Widgets are small applications that sit on your home screens showing whatever you want. Right now I have weather, Settings controls, Youtube, Facebook and Salon online magazine. It's real nice to be able to look at your screen and get all the info you need rather than having to crack open an app or a browser. This is partially why Android web usages is much lower because there's no need to go to the Web to get information when it's right on your home screen.I previously argued that this device was awful for note taking. I take part of that back. While the screen is tiny, using a real keyboard either via OTG or Bluetooth isn't that bad after I spent a month doing it. I still suggest getting a real laptop, iPad or Galaxy Note 10.1, but this will do in a bind. There's no latency in typing like other Android products have seen. The Asus Transformer with keyboard has a real noticeable latency issue when typing so much so it's unpleasant to type. The Nexus 7 with keyboard can write as fast as you can.A couple things I noticed:1) Some apps will cause a restart after updating. Turning off auto-update in Google Play will speed up your device as programs are no longer sucking resources to update on their own.2) Android itself doesn't do a very good job of reallocating resources over time. I need to restart my Nexus 7 about every two to three weeks where I can let my iPad 3 go for two to three months without restarting. It's a minor irritant.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so.Especially if you're an Ender's Game fan. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(17308, 17322)"

I tried with different antennas over the years, but no success. My wife read about this antenna and insisted I try this one. To make a long story short, I was quite surprised after hooking it up and doing a search for the local stations. My wife can now watch her favorite foreign language stations that she has been missing for years. I only wished I tried this before. It receives great. I didn't need to mount it on the wall. I simply lay it behind the TV and it works just fine there.UPDATE: Dec 14,'12After reading a few negative reviews since I first wrote my first review for this product, I felt I should add another few comments. It appears that this antenna is not a cure-all for everyone. However, it's worth a try. Amazon has a very good return policy which I have used many times. My initial positive review is NOT A FAKE REVIEW as others have implied. It may be possible that some geographic areas in the country still get bad reception due to topography, interference, etc. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1154, 1168)"

B00DVFLJDS,electronics,How much does the screen cost?,"This thing is amazing.  I own a TF700T.  A good tablet to be sure but it's at times too big and heavy for extended use.  The Nexus 7 is the perfect size and fits in my hand comfortably.  The size is the reason I bought this tablet.  But it's not the reason I love it so much.  The screen is brilliant and the speakers are amazing.  Normally, with most mobile devices, I struggle to hear music or movies with the volume up all the way.  With my phone or other tablet if I don't have an external speaker to pump sound through, it's not worth watching a movie.  With the Nexus 7, I have to turn the volume down slightly.  Oh joy!  Rapture!  A device with more than adequate sound!  I've never experienced such a mobile device before!Other than that, the device is beautiful and comfortable.  Top notch!But it's not all roses.  There are a few things to nitpick.  There's no micro HDMI port so even though the Nexus 7 is great to watch movies on if I'm not in front of TV, I'll still need my TF700T if I want to watch movies on a TV while on the road say at a hotel or at my parents house.  Then there's the lack of microSD card support.  There's not enough room on the device for all my music and because this is the wifi only version, I'm not always going to have access to my music on the cloud.These minor drawbacks prevent me from giving it 5 stars...but I knew these things going into the purchase.

B009LL9VDG,electronics,How do you have the number?,"I just finished a graduate program and have used this for over a year now, as a student, a job-seeker, an employee, and just for random daily tasks. I'll speak personally from how this has helped me in my specific situation, in case there is someone who may be in a similar situation.There are a few things about me that made me a great fit for this product:1) I own a desktop computerThere are some things I need a desktop for, and I have a desktop computer for those occasions. Interestingly, one of the things I learned is how little I really needed my desktop. I packed it away and didn't bother unpacking it for two months now. If anything it's probably a good thing that I can't play video games on this thing, so if you're a recovered game addict with relapsing tendencies (like yours truly), that's something to consider. But there are some things I'll definitely need the desktop for, such as photo editing, which I will eventually need to unpack the desktop to do.2) I use Google everything (gmail, drive, calendar, etc.)And so do a lot of my friends, making it very easy to work on Google and share my work with others. The suite of Google office products are pretty handy, and for most uses is more than sufficient. Because google docs do not count against your size limit on Google Drive, it feels like unlimited storage to me, and I've done just fine without any additional storage.3) I use Amazon Prime (mainly for movies, Kindle books)The vast majority of ""apps"" that you can add on the chromebook do little more than provide you a link, turning the bottom bar into a glorified ""favorites"" bar. The kindle is one exception, since you are able to download books for offline reading. Since I watch all my movies through Amazon Prime, it's not a big deal that there's no DVD player.4) I intend to carry this around all over the placeThis is ideal for carrying around because it's light and thin (I just leave it in my bag and I never think ""dang it, I shouldn't have brought my laptop today"") the battery life is great (I never really have to bring the charger unless I forgot to charge it the night before) and it's cheap (I've dropped it and I've dropped the bag it's in many times, but it hasn't broken yet, and I wouldn't be totally bummed as I would be if I dropped some other really expensive thin light laptop).5) The places I go have wifi anywayStarbuck's, McDonald's, school, library, etc. In my neighborhood there are a lot of places to go for free wifi.A few reasons why this product was not a good fit:1) Skydrive is not that good.This isn't Google's fault, but it does affect my review of whether or not you should buy this chromebook, because the chromebook is only as good as the apps that what it can run in the browser. The truth is that Skydrive is nowhere close to the much more robust Google Drive. It technically does a lot of the same things, and in some ways it is indeed better than Google drive at handling MS Office documents, but I've had too many instances where the website would fail and I would lose something I had been working on. No matter how many bells and whistles it has, the fact that it can't reliably work on things has made me lose hope on skydrive, so now if I really want to fine-tune a MS Office document, I have to find a PC.2) It's kind of weak sauce.It's okay with most things, and I can watch movies on it full-screen, but sometimes it's just slow, especially if you have a lot of tabs open. I've learned to be a lot more disciplined about tab-closing, and that's helped, but at some point the thing is just slow, and when I'm trying to work with two windows at the same time, scheduling things and responding to e-mails and such, there's a slight lag that will make things take longer than they would otherwise.CONCLUSION:If you're a no-frills kind of person and you're looking for something like this, then I recommend it, especially if you're broke like me. It doesn't have a lot of (or any, really) bells or whistles, but it can get quite a bit done.

On top of that, it did not make sense to me to pay over $60/mo more for cable tv when I do not watch tv for weeks at a time and have a limited selection of shows that I like when I do.  The Roku helped me to understand that I did not have to pay a monthly rental fee for a tv box in order to get HDTV.  My tv resolution is great. Set up is simple.  Plus, it is like getting tv on demand for a numerous selection of my all time favorite shows.  I watch what I like when I want- even if it's 2 am.

B0082YEH8M,electronics,Do you have a good point?,"This case is perfect for the new iPad mini! Not only is it super affordable, but it's very functional. I like the 3 deep grooves for the iPad to rest on (its super secure, it won't collapse or anything). At first I was worried that the case when placed in the groove would stick out too much (and my son would spill food on the inside of the case this way), but it doesn't jut out as bad as I thought it would. They provide an elastic to hold the cover together when you flip it all the way back so it doesn't flop around. The only downside is that elastic covers a sliver of the iPad's right side of the screen.The hand grip is super useful and very stretchy. I have small hands and it accommodates it nicely.

When you factor in the time span of my music collection, late 1960s until now, one can see it takes versatility to handleball of the content. I can attest that while the music is playing you cannot hear anything outside. My wife was watching a DVD and I could not hear a sound. In fact the bass sound waves fooled me because I could feel them in my belly, but I could not hear anything.I am well aware of burn in as my Klipsch speaker system required it and indeed over time they sounded better. I hope this is the same with these buds. I am not saying they are bad buds at all. I am saying the verdict is still out. At the price point $24, Idon' t see a mistake. Time will tell and I will report my findings as objectively as I can................................................................................................................................................................................................................As promised have had time for burn in and yes they needed several hours of play time to do that. With that said I am a R&B; fanatic. I love the bass runs in great R & B songs. These buds expose the  imperfections  in older recordings. However they handle the newer recorded music wonderfully. Listening to Michael McDonald's, I Second That Emotion is a treat. The bass is deep and clean, the midrange is good also. On the Temptations, Beauty's Only Skin Deep, Jamerisons bass licks are clean, but this is an old recording and these buds reveal the limitations of the equipment.I will definately purchase another pair of this brand.

B0042X9LC4,electronics,Is it a good lcd screen?,"I bought this camera on an impulse.  I dropped off my D40 and 35mm 1.8 for cleaning/small repair and was told I'd be sans camera for 3 weeks.  So, I said ""screw it"" and bought this camera and the 50mm 1.8 as a kit.  At first, much like a new pair of shoes, I was disappointed.  But once I broke in the soles, so to speak, I forgot how much I had paid and started to really enjoy this device.  I've since taken over 5,000 photos with it on my recent travels.  If you are debating between this and a D700, get both, as this is far better as a walking-around camera and the DX lenses are cheaper.  Or, if you want to save come coin, get the perfectly good D3100.  But neither will be as much fun as this puppy.  Nice weight without being too heavy, deep grip, quick autofocus and intelligent auto mode, and great performance at high iso.  I even use live view as my dog gets scared when I disappear behind the viewfinder.  Even video isn't bad, though an external mic is required.  Just buy it and don't look back.

B001G5ZTLS,electronics,How is the ability?,"If you are a canon user with a significant investment in L-Glass from previous crop bodies, you will want to consider getting this camera or the next iteration of it. This is a full frame camera that provides great resolution for awesome cropping or wide angle shots. Although the current AF system is old, it is still very good. You will need to make sure your glass and body are at their optimum calibration as it is possible that even new out of the box to be slightly off. The factory will calibrate any Canon products within the first year for free. I suggest that you take them up on the deal. The only cost is your shipping to them. They are fast and good at what they do. Be aware that every lens can be off in either direction from zero being a front or back focussing issue. The body itself can be off, so do make sure the setup is right before doing any comparisons. All EOS models now offer micro adjustments to limit the need for sending out for calibration if you don't have the ability to part with your equipment for a few days.The 5D Mark II takes stunning crisp photos. I've tested with 24-70 2.8L USM, 70-200 2.8L USM, 50mm 1.4, 85mm 1.8 with very good results. The HD video is a bonus. The lack of autofocus is not the worst trade off. The option to take clips of video when needed is nice though.If you are on the fence about brand to choose and have not invested to much in one brand or another, do look into both Nikon, and Canon for the best options for you. The extra focus points are really nifty on the d700, but the lack of resolution and HD video option on the canon side is a big plus. Those moving up from existing Canon Digitals will appreciate the faster and more accurate focus that comes with all 9 points being in focus with hidden focus point assisting the crisp focus to the corners. I'm very pleased with this model and the options for indoor and outdoor shooting. ISO is so good that 3200 is better than 1600 on my 50D.  The only issues I've had are with the slower continuous shooting FPS, and the flimsy shutter sound that does not inspire confidence in comparison to my 50D's fast and bold thuds. Ironically, the 5D2's capable of locking on to the targets in low light even with a delayed shutter will capture action more reliably than the 50D. I shoot a lot of indoor night shots in poorly lit gyms that the 5D2 outshines the 50D on the keeper rate with the identical lenses. The 50D has become my outdoor maximum reach tool. Even then the crops from the 5D2's are better. Its just the case where I carry the contrasting distance lenses to avoid missing shots altogether.A great camera that is up there with the really high end SLR's with a much lower entry level. Glass is still expensive but you can keep that for ever if you take care of it.Edit:After several years of pure magic from this camera and replacing the 50D with a 7D. The 7D is the next best thing to the 5D2 when the 5D3 is not an economical addition to your gear. The 5D2 has an incredible ISO range with such great image clarity, even with action shots in less than perfect lighting. Shooting side by side with the 7D has me wishing I just had 2 5D2's. This camera is the most affordable professional Full Frame camera on the market. It is still that great after all these years. Lenses go up in price, while bodies come down in price. Always get the glass first. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3376, 3390)"

B00F3SOHNU,electronics,What's the high resolution?,"I purchased this tablet as a refurb through Woot.  The first one I received had a bad dent in the top of the tablet right on the top of the volume rocker.  Woot agreed to replace it.  The second one I received was in ""like new"" condition.  Overall I reallly like this tablet.  Since updating it with the new KitKat OS the tablet is very responsive and I don't experience any lags that other people reported.  I did start having video problems with certain feeds with the new OS.  I would get a choppy, distorted image and bad pixelation. I found that by forcing all video to be rendered by the GPU, (by enabling the develooper options) solved this problem. Samsung has a bug somewhere and needs to fix this with an update.  I also wish Android and Adobe would sort out the Flash video fiasco.  Please kill this dead technology and get everyone on to HTML 5.  Instead Adobe keeps pushing it which makes life miserable for everyone on Android and Apple devices.  Developers need to be mandated to get off of the FLASH content as the industry has agreed to move to HTML5.  Yes, I know, you can still use Flash on this device, but it is a PITA to implement.One thing that is very nice is that you can work with two applications on a split screen at the same time on this tablet.  The downside is that you can only do this with select applications.  Samsung used to have a little tab on the left of the screen to pull the eligible apps out to choose for split screen work.  Once KitKat came out it is now on the right hand side of the screen with no visible tab.  What I don't like about this is you have applications that you swipe content from right to left and you end up pulling this tab out by accident. (Very annoying)  They should have left it where it was.  Samsung has media apps that flip pages from right to left - so putting the split screen applications on the right hand side of the screen makes no sense.  Samsung are you listining?The screen image is nice.  It is not ""Blow me away"" nice - but the resolution is very good.  The colors are very accurate for viewing pictures and watching movies.  It does not use a super Amoled screen and in my opinion other screens look better even though this tablet has higher resolution.  Why Samsung didn't use a super Amoled screen on this expenisve device is questionable.  The screen is very bright and most of the time I have the brightness at 50% or less.The part I thought I would like the best was the S-Pen.  Unfortunatelly, to me this is still awkard to use.  The only pen that works acurately with this tablet is the one that you get with the tablet.  I can't stand writing with this very thin writing instrument.  Samsung also doesn't give you any replacement nibs for it and it is almost impossible to find them anywhere.  I tried multiple other thicker OEM pens including Samsungs own S-pen with eraser for Galaxy note tablets, but all of them have a noticeable offset when writing which makes them unuseable for any fine writing work.  Why a vendor can't make a useable aftermarket pen for this device is a mystery to me.  I e-mailed Wacom, (who apparently makes the pens for Samsung) but they never responded back to me.  I wanted to buy their Bamboo ""Feel"" pen, as it was wider, but too many reviews said it also had this offset issue.  I guess I won't be buying their pen either.  So - if you want this for the writing capability, plan on using the very thin pen that comes with it and when the nib wears out, having to purchase another new pen.  In fact, I'd buy a second one now unless you can find the replacement nibs.  Apparently you can purchase them from Samsung directly, but I spent an hour on a chat line with Samsung service and got no where with them.  If they do have them, I'll bet it is cheaper to buy a whole new pen.Writing on the tablet is NOT like writing with paper and pen.  I don't care what anyone says,  In my opinion it is awkward at best and I have been practicing for quite some time.  Lecture Notes is the best app available for taking notes on this device but it is difficult to configure and set up.  Once you figure it out, it does give you some good functionality.  It also allows you to record lectures with audio and write notes at the same time.  Samsung has their own apps for taking notes but they could be integrated better and in my opinion, are not as good as the Lecture Notes application.  Hopefully Samsung will keep improving their applications for note taking.Battery life is acceptable but not great.  I usually get 1 day of use out of it with heavy use.  I simply charge it over night so I really don't care how long it takes to charge.  It has a very big baterry in it to feed a very powerfull processor so it is going to take a while to charge it back up.  I also hate not being able to replace the battery in these devices.  You actually can - but you have to watch some Youtube videos and do some minor surgery to accomplish this.  I figure by the time the battery wears out I'll probably want something newer anyway.I do like the media integration that Samsung put on this tablet.  The flip up from bottom of the screen function to receive your news, social media, etc. is very nice. Samsung also has a magazine/news application included which is very nice and well integrated into the tablet. They also include a free trial to Zinio for subscribing to magazines.  I'm sorry, but a 10 inch tablet is just not a good reading experience for magazines.  I find I constantlly have to zoom into the text to read them.I actually like the Samsung integrated application launcher and think they did a nice job of making the Android experience better.  Don't expect to get much help with learning this tablet.  I found the information on how to use it is scattered all over the internet.  Most of what I learned, I learned from other reviewers of the tablet.The tablet is quite expensive.  I saved about a hundred bucks buying it refurbished, but it still is more expensive than most tablets. However, when you consider the hardware this has I think it is worth it.  First you get two sets of quad core processors.  One set is for high power use and the other one is to save battery life when using applications that don't need the processing speed.  You get a six core video processor.  You get 3GB's of internal System RAM and 32GB of internal RAM.  I also applaud Samsung for letting you use an external micro SD card.  I have a 64GB card in mine and now 128GB micro cards are coming on the market.  This will certainly give this tablet longevity, allowing me to use it for years.The build quality of the tablet is average.  It's not bad, (don't get me wrong) its just not great.  They make a big deal about the stiched leather look on the back, but it is just plain old plastic.  So why bother?  Nothing about the tablet exudes quality to me.  For the price, Samsung should have included a case for it and made the actual unit out of metal alloy.  I purchased the Roo leather case which has been great.  It comes with a very protective leather cover that you can zip the tablet into and has a nice leather wrap around the tablet itself.  I wanted something that protected the tablet in case I dropped it.  In my opinion, this is the best case for the money as it is all leather.Overall I'm very happy with this tablet.  Yes, there are some minor issues with it and I still don't think the S-pen is everything it is cracked up to be.  I hope Samsung keeps improving it and comes up with better S-pen functionality.I would highly recommend this tablet, but would encourage you to look for discounts as Samsung has just announced that it will be replacing these with newer models this summer. (Including super amoled displays)  Plan on paying a premium for these newer models.In summary:Pros:Very responsive and powerful Tablet (Two sets of quad core processors- six core video)3GB of internal System RAMHigh Screen resolution - (best in class)Accurate screen colors - very bright screenSamsung's app launcher is nicely integrated to make the user experience better than stock Android in my opinion.32GB of internal RAM, can use an external micro SDHC card adding 64GB of user RAM (128GB coming)Can run two applications at once on the same screen (No other tablet can do this today)(However, apps that can do this are limited and you have to swipe from right to left to do it which inteferes with other apps) Even so - being able to have both your e-mail and browser up at the same time is nice. (Even two browser windows at the same time!Needs improvement:Quality and feel of tablet is mediocre and feels cheap for the money you pay.  (Back plastic stiching is cheesy and doesn't fool anyone)S-Pen needs improvement.  Biggest complaint is no other S-pen can be used with an offset issue - pen is too thin.Battery is adequate but could be better.  Plan on getting a full day out of it max in heavy use.  (Charge time is slow)No super Amoled screen.  Screen is very good - but not as good as Amoled screens on other devices with less resolution.Expect a long learning curve with information scattered all over the web.Expensive - Look for a refurbished or discounts to lower the price - otherwise wait for the new models to come outSamsungs customer support is not the best but is on par with everyone's lousy customer service these days.There is no perfect tablet on the market today.  The issues I raised are minor and overall, I still think this is one of the best tablets you can buy today.  If you can find a discount on this tablet, go for it.  You won't be disappointed.  I still think it is the best overall tablet you can buy at this time. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(9658, 9672)"

If your desk is rock solid it will hold the monitor, but if you have desks that shudder every time someone passes by, or when you nudge it inadvertently, the monitor will wobble annoyingly.

B001KC08A4,electronics,What remote control is amazing?,"We have a home theater setup behind cabinet doors in our living room so I installed a single infrared sensor on the outside of the cabinets connected to an infrared amplifier and infrared transmitters attached to each of six components.  We also have two smaller HT setups downstairs in an exercise room and a hobby room.  We enjoy occasional upgrades or component changes so universal remotes are very important accessories. After years of frustration with the buggy and difficult-to-program Harmony series of remotes, I checked with an HT professional on something better. This is what he recommended.  We now have five of these; three upstairs (for convenience) and two downstairs. We have had them in service for about four years and I can highly recommend them. They are built to last, very well designed, powerful and flexible yet easy to program.  I have yet to find a device or component that cannot be controlled in every conceivable way. These remotes are easy to program but I recommend keeping notes so that it's easy to come back later to tweak (improve) the programming later after using it for a while.  I would also recommend avoiding the &#34;punch through&#34; feature unless you have a very simple setup.  The problem with the punch through feature is that you have to give up full control of the device you are punching through.  It is a trade-off for convenience versus control.  One more tip: When the range or button responsiveness isn't quite right, try fresh batteries.  Battery life is very good but there is no battery life indicator and they continue to work somewhat on depleted batteries.  The good news is that they take two AA's, so no big deal.

B005HMKKH4,electronics,What about cable ?,"Yes, there is always a 'but'.  I bought 3 of these drives mainly because I was getting tired of using external hard drives that required their own power supply, and like the idea of a portable, USB powered backup.I've had WD drives before and not experienced any issues with them (I've got a couple of their 'powered' drives).  But these little buggers have been frustrating!ALL 3 WORK independently.  No issues there.  The trouble begins when you try to daisy chain and use more than one at a time!  A single 2TB drive was not going to be enough, so the plan was to link these together using a powered hub.My system:  HP 19"" laptop, running windows 7, 64 bit.  4 GB RAMHow I prepared and set up the drives:1 - The drives are ready to go out of the box.  The cables that come with them are PATHETICALLY SHORT.  About a foot long.2 - For each drive, I plugged them in one at a time and went into the properties to give them a unique drive name as to not confuse the computer, and keep them straight in windows explorer.  To keep it easy, I named them ""My Passport 1"", ""My Passport 2"", and ""My Passport 3"".  (I get the same problem I am about to describe if I have spaces in the name, or not)3 - To link them together, I made use of the following:a - HDE 2 Port USB 3.0 54mm Express CardB0046XUMDWb - Anker USB 3.0 7-Port Hub with 36W Power AdapterB006TT91TWc - AmazonBasics USB 3.0 A-Male to A-Female Extension CableB008EQYRRY4 - I tested the cable (3c Above) first by plugging each drive into the female end, and the male end into the express card (3a above).  the drive spun up, computer recognized it with no issues.  All 3 drives checked out OK.5 - I then tested the powered hub (3b above).  Plugged it into the Express Card (3a above) directly, the other end into an outlet.  I plugged in each drive one at a time (tested individually)... no issues.  all drives recognized.6 - next, I tested the hub WITH the cable.  I plugged the cable (3c) into the express card (3a), then the Hub (3b) into the cable (3c), AC adapter into the outlet.  The PC recognized the hub with no issues.This is where it gets puzzling:7 - I plugged ""My Passport 1"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, and windows explorer opened showing the new drive, and it appeared as 'My Passport 1"" in the directory tree.  could access the drive with no issues.8 - I plugged ""My Passport 2"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, and windows explorer opened showing the new drive, and it appeared as 'My Passport 2"" in the directory tree.  could access the drive with no issues.9 - I plugged ""My Passport 3"" into the Hub (3b).  Little blue light on the hub came on.  The hard drive started to flicker, computer made the 'discovery' sound, AND THAT WAS IT.  windows explorer would not see the 3rd drive, yet the computer must, because you get the audio tone as you did with the first 2.  I clicked on the properties for the drivers; on 'manage'; checked in 'device manager' - no way on earth to get to the 3rd drive.  yet you can pick it up and feel it is running.I installed the software that came with the hub, rebooted after installing each drive, nothing seems to work.10 - I ruled out a bad drive by repeating the procedures above, but changing the order of the drives being connected to the hub.  I started with 'my passport 3' - fired up, recognized no problems (yet in #9 - the computer would see it based on the sound, but that was it).  plugged in 'my passport 1'.  it also fired up, computer recognized - windows explorer opened - good to go.  plugged 'my passport 2' into the hub, behavior was similar to #9.things I have not tried yet:  2 drives in the Express card and one drive into the onboard USB2 port, but what sense would THAT make?  all 3 USB 3.0 drives will boot individually with the hub, but no more than 2 of them.ANYONE else had this problem or have a solution?  you should be able to plug all 3 drives into the 7 port hub with no issues.

I was looking through the reviews and couldn't find a review that would describe the interaction of this unit with Audible Useage.1. Very small and compact- The unit is really tiny. All I want to do is listen to books. The screen is small enough to see easily but doesn't take up space so the buttons are larger.2. Great Sound-This unit sounds as good or better than my Ipod.3. Simple Navigation buttons-Took less than 5 minutes to learn.4. On off button which I use as Pause too. It is well located to the top directly over where the headset plugs in, I can find it by feel and don't need to see it. So it is convenient to find an use. When you turn off the book while running it comes back on at the same point still running. The time to turn on and start playing the book is less than 5 seconds. I've found that this feature is key to my enjoyment of using the unit with Audible. No fumbling through the other buttons to find pause.5. Convenient Lock mechanism, which I never use, just push the home button for 5 seconds. No cumbersome hard to find slide mechanisms. Where this unit blows away the Ipod units is that there is no touch sensitive wheel. Everything is push button. Without that sensitive wheel, I've never had to lock the unit. I had an Ipod which used the wheel which is sensitive so I always had to lock it. Big pain in the neck.7.Sound controls are on the side, again push button and stiff enough not to trigger by accident. I prefer this to the ipod system.8. It organizes each book into it's own separate folder so it's an extra click but your books are organized together9. When part 1 of a book ends it automatically go to the next part.But won't open a new book. This is advantageous because if you fall asleep with Audible running than it runs to the end of the part of the book you are on, than the next part (if you aren't on the last part) and than it goes to sleep. This can reduce battery drain.IE listen before going to bed.10. Uses the standard Mini USB connector (the one that's bigger) so you can charge and Sync with the standard one used on many devices. I just bought 2Technocel MV9MCDUO-SP OEM Sprint Dual USB Port Car Charger - Blackalong with 2Dual Micro USB / Mini USB Splitter Cable - Charge up two Devices (One Micro and One Mini USB) Once From a Single USB Port - Ideal for mp3 players, Digital Cameras, Smartphones (Android, BlackBerry, HTC, Samsung), GPS, and More. This gives me 2 micro USB and 1 Mini USB in my Autos. With 1 of the Micro USB being rapid charge. I love devices with standard Micro USB connection. By the way I have aDMMR: Dual mini USB and Micro USB to USB Sync and Charge Cable (Retractable)at my office and it charged and transferred data flawlessly with this unit.I have a mini usb connection at home that I use for my Card Reader also transferred data and charged it.  Hurray. It's standard Micro USB.12. Fast Forward and Rewind are as good if not better than the Ipod and convenient. Actually the Forward and reverse start slowly, than speed up the more time the button is held. This is advantageous because it allows for both slight f forward/Reverse and extreme f forward/reverse14.Expandable Memory using Micro SDHC. It was just so inexpensive I bought a 8gb MicroSDHC on Amazon for $6.00+ delivered8GB Sandisk MicroSDHC Memory Cardthis one is class 4 don't buy the class 2 might be too slow. With how cheap memory is it's better to buy the 4gb unit and upgrade instead of the 8gb unit. 4 gb does hold alot of books.15. Convenient Eject system from computer- I kept looking for the eject on my Windows Machine to disconnect. Finally I went to the manual. Turns out that as long as you aren't synchronizing you just pull the Unit out with no damage. Very convenient.15. You can listen to it while it's charging.The glitches:1. Battery life. Audible Playback only at fairly high volume using headphones. I only got around 7 hours. my Ipod Nano gets 14 hours. I had to take 2 stars off because that would be a deal breaker for many.2. For Audible can only use the Audible Manager.Remember Audible books are DRM Protected so you need the Audible Manager to decrypt and put on the Clip+3. Their is no way to organize the order of the books. It goes in Alphabetical Order (If I'm wrong please tell me how to do it in comments.4. Itunes tried to take over so I had to remove ITunes but I think that there is a setting or way that I could disableItunes from turning on automatically. Also my original default was through Itunes. Just be aware there may be issues withItunes and Audible Manager on your machine. Probably you can get around it.5. The books are grouped by Books. So if you are in part 1 of a book it'll play part 2 but won't go to the next book.Since it doesnt' go automatically. You have to stop and fiddle with it. This could be inconvenient for example if you are driving. Unfortunately once the book is organized on the machine their is no way to change the order. I have some books where it decided to put the Part 2 at the top and part 1 below. I tried accessing the drive in MTP mode which turns it into a hard drive. In Mtp Mode it showed as in order. So there was no way to fix a problem that doesn't exist when accessing the unit as a hard drive. To find the Mtp and MSC mode it's simple Press the home button&lt;Settings&lt;System Settings&lt;USB Mode&lt; For loading books Audible manager will only recognize in MSC Mode.6. I'd prefer that it used a Micro USB connector which is used on most newer phones.7. Controls are very small. I have to hold it in front of me to use all the buttons except the on off and volume button.8. When Fast rewinding or forward my Ipod used to allow me to hear the words so it was easier to find the spot. This is totally silent.9. If I turn unit off and than back on sometimes it will resume at the beginning of the chapter that I was on. But I had the same problem with my IPOD. So I don't believe it's a Clip+ specific problem.If you like this review please rate it as helpful. When I was deciding whether to purchase this unit, I had trouble finding anything about the compatibility with Audible ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(7450, 7464)"
B0075SUK14,electronics,How is the zoom?,"We just returned from a trip overseas and brought both the S95 and the SX260. We have owned the S95 for the past 2 years and really liked the camera but we wanted to get another camera as a backup and also to get one with a higher optical zoom. We tested both cameras in multiple situations on the trip and came to the conclusion that the S95 takes better night shots but the SX260 takes better shots in the day and the 20X optical zoom is extremely useful. The S95 allows you to go full manual but the SX260 gives you many options to play with your photo taking. Overall, if I could only take one camera I would take the SX260 because the optical zoom and picture quality is great. The night photos were pretty good too but not as good as the S95 (obviously if you are planning on taking more night shots, then the S95/100 would probably be better for you). On a side note, the GPS on the SX260 sucks battery life very quickly and the camera has a difficult time finding the GPS signal (we left it off for most of the trip) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1025, 1039)"

B006K551LM,electronics,How are battery?,"Updated Review:On the surface this looks like a nice camera. Compact, HD video and stills, and Wi-Fi connectivity to convenient sharing sites.There is good and bad.I originally felt there was a lot more BAD with this camera, but after additional testing I have given this camera a better rating.At this time the Bloggie cannot connect to Facebook: Trying to do so takes the user to a SONY web page that informs you that the Facebook upload service is temporarily not working and will not be available ""until December"". (Note, I am writing this in March.) The SONY rep I spoke with says they are currently working on this issue and the December Date is not realistic. He believes it will be corrected in the next couple of weeks. I have to mention, that Sony's customer service did help me through a few the problems I was having with set-up and function. This made the difference between me returning the camera and keeping it.Connecting and Uploading to my I-phone via wi-fi is a little touchy. When it works; it works fine. There are times when I am in areas that something, in the air, blocks the signal between the two devices. When it works this is a convenient feature. I bought this camera so I would not tax my I-phone with home video file bloat. It's nice to be able to grab a picture from the Bloggie via wi-fi and then edit the image using one the photo editing apps I have on my I-phone.Uploading to You-tube worked. I didn't run into any problems uploading a video to You-Tube and video appeared on the site in a minute.Connecting to Playmemories, the Sony photo/video upload site, worked well. The connection to the site was not always solid and uploaded images dropped about 25% of the times I tried. I can't tell if this is a wi-fi problem or a problem with the Playmemories site. Maybe I am missing a control feature, but I noticed that ALL photos and Videos upload to the site upon connecting. I would prefer that it allowed me to check images and videos for uploading.Recording LIVE video to the QIK web site, after an account is set up, worked really well. I was actually impressed at how easy this was.At first I was really disappointed in the fact that the focus ring creates a tapping noise that can be heard on the video. After additional testing I have found that the condenser mic hears this woodpecker-tapping sound when there is no other sound in the room. The mic opens up and listens for sound and the sound it picks up is the focus mechanism. I noticed that the tapping sound was not loud when other sounds were in the room. Considering I am using this movie for blogging and home vacation home movies, this tapping is no longer much of a bother to me.The video is very clear. The focus function is slow to react to subject distance changes. I would suggest setting up a shot if you can, tap the screen so the camera focuses on your subject and then start recording.At another Amazon customer's suggestion, I tested the recording length time:In HD, the camera stayed in record mode for 24 1/2 minutes before it stopped recording. It does not automatically start recording another file. You have to start a new recording manually. This isn't a problem for home movie recording, but it would be a problem if you're recording a performance, play, musical event or other lengthy topic where you would want the camera to keep rolling. If this is your need, get a bigger camera.While recording video you can press the snapshot button on the top of the camera and get some nice still-shots on the fly. I really liked this feature.The images are crisp but I feel the shutter speed is a little slow so, if your subject is moving, expect a little blurring.I used kept this camera in my pocket over the last few days and really used it. I recorded indoors and outdoors and, despite a few out-of-focus shots, I really got some nice clean, crisp video that I'm happy with.I wish SONY had allowed for a memory bump via a card slot.After getting the camera set-up on my computer, connection and image upload has been really easy. The files are compatible with all of my video editing programs and the video looks really nice when it's burned to DVD.For the money I spent, I couldn't find anything else on the market that offered what this camera does.

I had to make a decision on content, iTunes vs Amazon, and Amazon won hands-down.Amazon continues to add content and value at not additional cost. Prime membership is still only $80 per year. I can access my movies on the Fire or my Roku. The fire will also play to your TV via HDMI.I listen to several podcast each week, all at no-charge. I also enjoy the linking of audio books with the e-book. While driving, I can listen to an audio book or music. Once home, I can pick-up where I left off on the e-reader.I just gave my iPad to my son and my Kindle Touch e-reader to my granddaughter. All excellent products but not getting any use since I bought the Fire HD.It's all a matter of what is the right fit. They're all amazing products. This is not a subsitute for a small laptop if you're a student. It is a great portable media device that gives you access to a wealth of free or inexpensive content.I was very surprised the lack of 3G did not bother me. The large storage capacity made it a non-issue for the most part. I just load it up with content and use my smart phone for email. Of course many smartphones can be used as a wi-fi hot spot.Amazon has a generous trial period, give it a try.By the way, I'm also happy with the Amazon Kindle Fire cover.

B0074FGLUM,electronics,What is the quality of the blacks of the screen?,"I bought this at a local big box retailer for my mom, and after spending 3 hours trying to get it working, I had to return it for a simpler TV from a different maker. In short, the TV looked beautiful with a fantastic screen and a great look to it. But when it came to setting it up for Smart apps (like Netflix), it would not work. It connected to the Internet and acknowledged the connection, but not a single Smart app worked. An hour call into Samsung tech support, who was very accommodating, proved completely fruitless, as they wound up suggesting getting someone out there to service the unit. It was 3 hours after I bought it, so I took it back and bought a different make TV. I could only imagine how complicated the TV would have been for mom had it crashed without me around, and so in the end, it was better for her to have a non-smart TV hooked up to a simple Roku box instead, which is what I did, costing about the same in the end. I will now be very skeptical of Samsung Smart TV features, and would need to see a fully functioning unit in person before ever considering it again. For me set-top boxes seem the better way to go after this encounter. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1167, 1181)"

B00007056H,electronics,What is the quality of the pair?,"These headphones are perfect for casual listening. I've been using this specific brand of headphones for about 12 years now, and I refuse to buy another brand or style.It started about 25 years ago, when I was living with my parents, and I had a pair of headphones that I absolutely LOVED! About 10 or so years ago, I wanted to try and find another pair just like them, so I went searching.I finally realized that the pair I used when I was younger were called Porta-Pro, also made by Koss. However, those are a little more expensive and I didn't really like the way they felt on my head. Maybe it's my big head, but they just felt too tight. So, somebody recommended these, and I just fell in love with them.The are very comfortable - even for my big head. It's almost like you're not even wearing headphones. I like the design, and the soft, blue material on top is comfortable resting on your head. Also, the volume control is very convenient. I always use it as opposed to the volume on my MP3 player or computer now.The only negative is that - since they are so inexpensive - they are made of cheaper materials, and my two boys (ages 9 and 11) have torn up a few. Usually, the jack gets shorted out and one, or both, of the speakers stop working. This could easily be fixed with some solder and an iron, but since they're so cheap, I usually just buy another pair. Also, the pads tend to wear down over time, but that's to be expected. You can purchase an extra set of pads as a backup, which I did.As for the sound? It's great. There is a lot of bass response in the phones, and the volume can get pretty loud. The sound is also very clear, and I would compare the audio quality to $100 headphones I've owned in the past.I highly recommend the KTX-Pro1 headphones by Koss. These are hands down the best value for a headphone under $20. Trust me, you won't go wrong with these cans. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1888, 1902)"
B003VAHYTG,electronics,Do you think it is a good cooling system?,"I love listening to music and watching movies on my computer, but I have always relied on relatively cheap speakers (or even my built-in laptop speakers) to provide my sound. I decided to order these speakers and take my music and videos to ""the next level"" and see if these speakers could deliver the loud, clear, and rich sound I expect from more expensive stereo systems and speakers.Below are my positive and negative evaluations of the Logitech Z623 speaker system.Positive:- The subwoofer is huge, and provides a nice, rich, bass sound. I am amazed at the loudness and clarity of the bass.- The speakers may seem little, but they produce a big and rich sound, with very little vibration or feedback.- The overall sound quality and clarity is impressive. When I listened to my favorite songs, I heard sounds and instruments I had never heard before. Watching videos with these speakers has opened up an entirely new (and great) listening experience!- To test the unit's power, I turned the volume on full blast (with the computer volume turned on full as well) and the sound was pretty much flawless.  I didn't hear any rattling or feedback. These speakers are pretty loud, and definitely loud enough for what I need.Negative:- The cords are a little short, but not too short as to be annoying.- The unit is large (the entire set weighs about 22 lbs). This means that moving the speakers and subwoofer is a little inconvenient. I am used to moving speakers around with my laptop. I really can't do this with these speakers.Overall, this is a great speaker system, and I am glad I upgraded from the cheap speakers. Until now, I didn't know what I was missing using cheaper speakers. I plan on using these speakers any time I watch a video, listen to music, or play games. Their loud and rich sound has turned my computer into a powerful stereo system (I want to throw a party just to show them off!).

It will automatically find your Chromecast device and allow streaming from the browser.Unfortunately, two phone calls to Chromecast support failed to even ask me how the computer I was using to set up was connected to the internet... a very important and obvious thing to ask it seems to me!  One rep actually told me my router wouldn't work unless I turned off security (not an issue since Chromecast is compatible with both WEP and WAP).  Another rep sent me an email with instructions on how to install from an Android phone when I specifically told her I had an iPhone.  I suppose the tech support will catch up as these devices become more common and are used by non-techies.All it all, if you read all you can (the reviews here are very helpful and accurate) and understand what it can and cannot do, you will be happy with this device.

B003ZX8B2S,electronics,How is the device?,"Although my wife and I drive all over the southern United States for recreation, for some reason I just never saw a need for a navigator. I could always get some kind of map off the Internet or stop at triple-A and get directions, and once I got close, drive around until I found whatever it was we were looking for. Sure, sometimes I'd drive by the place four times before figuring out that was it. Sure, I'd end up in the wrong part of town at a bad (dark) time of day. Sure, sometimes we'd have to run to catch the start of a concert or to not lose our restaurant reservation. But that's all part of the ""fun"", right?Not anymore.Garmin Nuvi takes care of all that. With updated, always current, always correct lifetime maps, it always gets me where I'm going in plenty of time. Unlike a map, it not only tells me where we're going, but it gives me suggestions and directions, like ""stay right"" or ""take the SECOND exit"". The programming and operation is easy, with just a little three-page manual to tell you all you need to know to utilize all of the Nuvi's features. The big screen is highly readable and understandable. And as far as I can tell so far, as long as you put in the correct address, it knows how to get there. I even kind of like the sensible female voice (someone told me her nickname is ""Terrible Tammy"" - I don't know). This unit is desirable because it not only comes with lifetime maps, it comes with all the cords and accessories you need to get it up and running. I have only two small gripes: The map downloading process is painfully, excruciatingly slow. I know I don't have the fastest computer in the world, but it isn't doorstop material yet, either, but the overall software installation, map download, map verification, and loading onto the Nuvi took very close to two and a half hours. Make sure you update well in advance of any planned trip. (I suggest starting it at bedtime the night before.) The other gripe is that the suction cup mount really needs to be completely free of dirt and the windshield where you are attaching it sparkling clean. Any kind of residue on the glass or grit on the suction cup is going to send your Nuvi to the floor, where mine has been four or five times already. Even with those two nits, this is a device that exceeded my expectations and has made travel more, not less, pleasurable. So I'm going to give it the five stars it would have deserved if I had a faster computer and a clean car. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2460, 2474)"

I've used other Logitech mice, as well as Toshiba and Microsoft, and they have all died on me within a few months- I guess I have bad luck. Anyway, this one is still going strong, and I don't think I've ever had to change the batteries since purchasing.It has a button on top below the scroll wheel that will let you make the scroll wheel either tactile so that it ""clicks,"" or free so that you can scroll super fast. Awesome feature. You can also program the thumb button- a nice feature. The mouse is a touch on the large side for me, but it feels nice in the hand. Sometimes the top button that controls the scroll wheel can get in the way, but it's really not a big deal to me- in fact, I usually just use it as a rest for my scrolling finger.As stated in other reviews, if you think the mouse is too heavy, you can actually remove a battery and it will still work.Overall, it's a great mouse that has held up longer than any of the others I've owned. Worth the money!EDIT (3-3-13): I've owned this mouse for about two years now, no issues. The scroll wheel still glides (or clicks, whichever you prefer) without issue, and no problems with any of the buttons. As mentioned in the original review, any other mouse I've owned was toast by this point. As far as I can recall, I still have not had to change the batteries in this thing, and I pretty much never turn the power on it off - like, ever. Every once in a while when traveling (which is almost never), I'll have the forethought to turn the power off before putting it in my bag, but 90% of the time it stays in the ""on"" position while sitting on my desk.

You can carry around in your hand a whole library of large or small books and read them at your leisure, which can be just about anywhere. I think that aspect of it is great.There are also all kinds of games for it. I like a handful of the basic time-wasters, but otherwise I stay away from them.It does not have the basic card reader. It is designed with the idea that all of your storage will be on Amazon's Cloud Storage. Amazon gives you unlimited storage for the materials which you purchase from them, plus 5 GB for personal data. You can't transfer images from your favorite camera onto it, unless it has built-in WiFi (maybe). The Kindle is designed to rely only on it's built-in camera. I don't consider the built-in camera to be real great. Plus I consider the built-in camera awkward to use. It seems like the main idea of it is to take pictures of the user. Use with video calls and video conferencing would be ideal for it.Unlike the Netbooks, which were popular a couple of years ago, this tablet does not replace a computer in any sense of the word. You will still need a computer in addition to this tablet.Also, while I am on computer issues, Amazon's instructions say that this table will connect to any computer. This idea does not seem to be true with some computers and operating systems. My computer would be an example. The Kindle transfer system relies on the newest version of the Windows Media Player. I am running Windows 7-64 Premium on a 1 year old Toshiba. It has an AMD 64 bit processor and the 64 bit version of Windows 7. (Amazon and Microsoft both indicate that I am a minority with this choice.) I have the Windows Media Player on my computer. However, Microsoft gives me the message that the newest version of their Media Player will NOT run on my system. Apparently, my version of Windows Media Player is upgraded as far as Microsoft is going to upgrade it. (I never use it anyway.) It also appears that Kindle can not transfer files to my computer without the newest version. To get files from one computer to the other, it seems that I will have to email them to myself. (This is going to be a pain.)WiFi connections are problematic. That said, the Kindle version seems to be more problematic then most. I travel all over the USA. If you are in an area where there is a lot of WiFi routers, then the Kindle seems to get confused and refuses to work. Or you start running into security issues with everyone.I mentioned before that I am a movie buff. There is not room on it's internal storage to download a bunch of movies to it, and there is no external storage except on Amazon. I have even tried attaching an adapter and card reader card to it. This idea didn't work. Kindle won't recognize the card.I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard which works fine with it. But while I can pair up my computer to the Kindle with a Bluetooth connection, I still can not transfer files to/from my computer to the Kindle using it. (Don't know why, yet.)One thing that I have noticed is that this is a great idea to increase Amazon's business. I have purchased several apps and books from Amazon for it. Books are usually a lot cheaper to buy for use on Kindle. Apps are usually very cheap. And it is really nice to have a whole library to read at any given point where I have extra time. The built-in reader which reads books back to you is another great feature. I like have it read to me while I sit back and relax. (I am reminded of teachers asking me in high school if I was reading with my eyes closed and my head laying on the books.)Another issue that I have run into is the Kindle headphone-speaker plug. I am working trying to find out what works and what doesn't work with it. I have one set of headphones which will work with it, and they sound great. But most headphones and speakers won't work with it. The receiver socket of the plug-in area is recessed, and only a plug with an indented collar will make a connection. Standard speakers and headphones for other devices don't seem to work with it since their connecting plugs don't slide inside the socket far enough.The sound from the Kindle is great. The video is great. It is easy to read. There is a ton of things that you could do with it.In short, the Kindle is a great idea. But it still needs work.Update: Sept 18, 2013I have ordered many things from Amazon using my Kindle Fire HD.But it hit me that not all of the items available from Amazon will show up on the Kindle when browsing and placing orders. An example would be a jacket that I just received. I am a big person, and need big clothes. I ordered the largest size of a jacket that I liked using my Kindle Fire HD. It barely fits me. I looked at the jacket that I ordered on my home computer and saw that Amazon offers the jacket the next 2 sizes larger, and in additional colors. The additional larger sizes and colors where not showing on my Kindle when I placed the order.As I said before, the Kindle fine for reading books, magazines, and for a person's personal entertainment. In fact, it is great for that. But it does not replace a computer. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5268, 5282)"

B001UQ6F5M,electronics,How is the unit?,"I picked this unit for the Netflix. Wireless configuration was a breeze. Was using Netflix in just a few minutes. Netflix works extremely well. Seemless kick ask video performance. It also offers Vudu. Didn't know what this was so I gave Vudu a try. Kick ask. I didn't know HD could be streamed over the internet so well. Movies look great on Vudu and so easy to use through the BD390. When I show Vudu to other people I get confused looks. ""Your Blu-ray player is going on the internet? Huh.""I was not impressed with the music playing via the USB port. There is no shuffle; not even within a single folder. And then when you get to the end of the last file in a folder, instead of continuing to play the first file on the next folder, it just stops. Not kick ask. Lame. I can fit my entire music collection on a 4 GB USB stick, so I intend to use the BD390 to listen to music with the USB and not use CDs. These limitations on USB play back are lame.I have to hand it to blu-ray player makers on how much stuff they are jamming into these small and afforable boxes. There are billions of formats (both audio and video) and media types to deal with. Really amazing. But you know, I once bought a $49 DVD player that could remember the stopped position of the last 5 DVDs played. So if you ejected the DVD and then re-inserted it, it could continue playing where you left off. I have yet to see a blu-ray player offer this feature, but near the climax of DVD player feature advancement, many DVDs offered this feature. This is a very usefull feature if disk switching occurs before finishing them. So to some degree, I'm poo-pooing all blu-ray players until I see this commonly available DVD feature on blu-ray players. Skip the non-kick ask BD Live. I can really care less about BD Live, but I'm sure thousands of hours of engineering development went into it.-- Begin Update 11/29/2009 --I just realized the BD390 can remember the stopped position of blu-rays even if you eject the disc. The manual is very unclear about this feature. Manual seems to indicate it does not work for all discs. Only tried with one disc, so don't know how many stop positions it can store. The $49 DVD player refered to above could store five.-- End Update 11/29/2009 ---- Begin Update 12/10/2009 --OK, the assessment of whether the BD390 can remember the stopped position is still unclear. I have had several disks now that don't even remember their stopped position even if you do not eject the disk. So, in other words, I'm leaving the disk in, but just stopping play and powering down the BD390. When I power the BD390 back up, the disk left in starts back up with the trailers and goes to menu. Not kick ask. I don't know why with the 11/29/2009 update above it remembered the position with that disk and other do not. When I did the test on 11/29, I did not power down the unit; just ejected and reloaded. With the last few disks, even if eject and reload without powering down, they still don't remember stopped position. So it seems the functionality is hit and miss here. I'm hoping LG sees this as a problem and offers a firmware update.-- End Update 12/10/2009 ---- Begin Update 6/2/2010 --It appears that LG has fixed the hit and miss problem of remembering the stop position of a disc. With the latest firmware update, the player remembers where a disc was left.-- End Update 6/2/2010 --The picture quality is great with the BD390. It is not clear from the marketing, but this blu-ray will upconvert DVDs to 1080p. DVDs look great. The BD390 can also output either 24 or 60 Hz video. If you intend to have the HDMI AND component video hooked up, then component video can only output 480i. Otherwise, if HDMI is not hooked up, component video can output 1080i. HDMI can of course output 1080p.The front display is not kick ask. No way to see the remaining time on a movie or even the duration of a movie through menu options. And when playing USB music, you have to have the TV on. You just cannot navigate the folders without looking at the TV. All you see is the time of play on the front display. I think they could have managed to get the display to show folder and file information on the display. My car stereo can do it. Take away a few thousand hours of development on BD Live and improve the display on the unit. Also, MP3 files only show the file name on TV. It does not read the MP3 metadata tag information, which is really better for getting the artist and song title.One thing that is really kick ask is how the BD390 does firmware updates. You may say, ""Who cares."" Well you should. How long do you expect to keep your BD390? Do you really think Netflix Watch Instantly will remain the same service in the next five years or so? Will Vudu even still be in business? Well, interfaces to these services will evolve over time. New services could become available. The BD390 will need firmware updates to keep up. If you have ever done a firmware update on a non-internet enabled blu-ray player, you know it is a pain in the ask. You have to download from the internet the updated firmware, burn to a CD, then insert in player and turn unit on. The BD390 checks for updates when you turn it on. If it determines there are updates, it asks you if you want to do the update. It then goes on the internet, downloads the new firmware, and then installs it. Very painless. Totally kick ask.So I have nit-picked a bit, but over all, the BD390 is kick ask. Netflix is just awesome.-- Begin Update 12/16/2009 --I have since down graded my rating to 4 stars. This Blu-ray player has since locked up twice. Once when doing stuff with the set up menus. Another time when just turning the TV on while it was playing music. When you turn on the TV, something goes on with the HDMI. Somehow this caused it to freeze and I had to shut it off and turn it back on. Combined with the hit and miss stop position memory (which is a defect in my opinion since it is inconsistent), and now these freezes, I cannot justify a five star rating anymore.-- End Update 12/16/2009  -- ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6060, 6074)"

This one is much larger than the Nikon/Canon variants (other than the Canon 1.2 of course!!!). But still, it is not THAT big. Feels real good on my D700. I also LIKE the 77mm filter size as that is somewhat of a standard filter size in Nikonland and I have them already! This compares favorably, for example, to the new Nikon 50 1.4 AFS as that takes an unusual filter size for Nikon shooters (58mm).Anyway, this lens is solidly constructed, as I would expect from a Sigma EX lens. It also focuses quickly, accurately, and quietly, with the well implemented HSM focusing system that Sigma has developed. It is also sharp, acceptably-so wide open, and razor sharp stopped down a bit. Nice bokeh. Combine this with a D700 or D3 and you have perhaps an incomparable low combo!

It didn't set up very fast and took a number of tries to get the macros right for turning on the TV and switching input devices, but once it was set it's been great.  My kids are 12 and 15 and are thankful for the remote.  They don't have to ask for my help to play video games or watch a DVD anymore.A few particular features I like about the remote:1. The keys for the most part are backlit and when you move the remote the display and backlight are activated, you don't have to push a button.2. It is rechargable.  I hate having to replace batteries every few months.  It lasts almost a week on one charge... but I put it on the charger after about 3 or 4 days.  I don't want to chance being without this baby.3. It will learn commands from my other remotes.  This was very helpful when setting up the macro for switching TV inputs.  Even tho I put the TV make and model in it didn't know how to switch from SAT input to DVD input without a little learning.  This all depends on your TV.  Mine is a Mitsubishi WD-65733.  I also had to tell it what the inputs were called and which ones were listed in what order.  Beware... I think it was case sensitive in setup.4.  If you want to go into the advanced features of one of your devices without using the macros to do what you want to do you can still do that.  Just a double click of a button and you can set the surround sound on your stereo receiver or modify the night display on your DVD player... and so on.5.  It controlls my HD DVR from DirectTV so I can still FWD,RWD, pause, and record without any problems.  It does everything the remote for the device did.6.  You can upload your own photos to the remote and set them as the background in the display.What I don't like???There are really only two things I would change about it and that's the feel of the buttons and the ease of setup.  Some buttons are very small and they're hard plastic.  Some remotes have the nice big rubber buttons and for some people they really like those.  I don't know how you could make it easier but I did have to get it to learn a few commands from my TV remote.  Some people just aren't into computers and electronics much and could get frustrated by this.Over all, this is one sweet remote.  My friends are jealous when they come over.

I bought the E3D420VX and set it side-by-side with each existing TV one at a time. I fed the same signal into both the E3D420VX and one of the old ones simultaneously. I compared the two TVs with standard definition 480i digital (from my satellite box), with 480p from an antenna, and then with 1080i from the antenna. (I don't yet have HD service from my satellite provider.)With both types of signals, the old TVs were both noticeably better than the E3D420VX. The E3D420VX was not as bright, even with the backlight and the brightness turned up to 100%. The colors were not as vivid and not as true as on either of the older sets, regardless of how much I adjusted the color settings. With the 480 signals, the E3D420VX showed a lot of pixellation around the edges of everything in the picture. Even with the 1080i signal, there was a little more pixellation than with the old TVs running at 480i. Finally, the sharpness was noticeably worse on the E3D420VX.One major annoyance was that the E3D420VX takes a long time to come on once the power button is pushed. Perhaps the CCFL backlights need time to warm up??? The VX37L does not have any delay.Finally, I was hoping that with the internet apps, there would be a browser so that I could access general internet features (searches, etc.). But no such luck.I next tried a Vizio E421VO. With the same tests, the results were nearly the same; both the old TVs out-performed the E421VO.I decided to try one more time. So I bought a Vizio M420VT. It's a keeper! The picture is bright, the colors are true, and the 1080i is sharp with no pixellation. With the 480 signals, there is still some pixellation, but it's acceptable if I sit back at least ten feet. So it's time to upgrade my satellite service to HD.

B0012S4APK,electronics,Do you like tv?,"I read a lot of reviews and comments where people said the instructions were hard to follow. And missing parts. This had me worried.that i would receive a product that would be poorly made. And it took 3 days just to start the shipping process. Figured they were throwing stuff in a box as they went. The box they used was a commercial box it wasn't like they just threw it in a paper bag.My experience was completely opposite. They provide you with more than enough bolts. Every tv is different they cant possibly match every TV in the world. But they sure did their best they offered 3 different sizes of mounting bolts. Everything was neatly labeled in plastic bags by letter, and part name.The instructions were so simple a 3 year old could do it. As with all machined equipment best advice is if something isn't lining up DONT TRY TO FORCE IT. Just think it thru turn it like a puzzle until things line up perfect.That being said, there were a few down sides that i've also seen from other comments. The adjustment of the swivel makes no sense to me. If you adjust it then the locking pin wont line up or the screws wont line up.. something wont line up if you swivel it.Finally the safety pins are a pain in the you know what to screw in if you have a thin tv. It's so close to the wall. And i wouldn't suggest not tightening them as any upward motion to the tv you risk the thing falling down. I had to find a socket that would fit around my screw driver, attach the socket to an extension arm... just to be able to reach the screw.I'd suggest that Cheetah consider making some sort of an extension rod that can be used to help reach them. Even if it's just a solid bar with a Phillips head on the end and a nut on the other that you can attach a socket wrench to and use it to reach the screws.I'm not sure how much this would raise the cost, and i  commend them on how many extra bolts and washers they provide. Those have to add up over time. just to have the extras thrown away.Another note, by the advise of my father who helped me hang the thing, an ex carpenter, we ditched the anchors since we were drilling into studs. Just drilled a pilot hole(tiny hole) and used a ratchet to screw the lag screw in. From doing minimal research on the internet(and i suggest you do the same) anchors are only needed for concrete or if you cant find the stud.Long story short, i  had a pleasant experience. It fit my 60 inch Panasonic and i have no doubt it will hold firm.May ever order a second one for my other TV. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2518, 2532)"

B0074BW614,electronics,How time does the battery last?,"Kindle Fire HD 7""Having been an Android and iOS user for the past few years (iPod Touch, iPhone, Motorola Droid2, Samsung Galaxy S3, Kindle Touch, Motorola MotoACTV), I've been anxious to try a Kindle Fire. Going in, I knew it wouldn't be a pure Android ecosystem nor would it have the latest in hardware. I looked at the Google Nexus 7 (Asus) and a Google Nexus 10 as well as the Asus Transformer tablets. The positive aspects of those tablets mainly focus on the Android operating system. Since I'm a fairly heavy consumer of Amazon products and services, the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) isn't a bad choice.It's easy to navigate, although the Carousel is rather annoying than useful. I prefer Android Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean as it allows far more flexibility and customization. That said, KFHD 7.2.3 is actually based on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, according to Antutu Benchmarks.The Silk Web Browser works much like any other Android browser, and the Kindle Fire integrates seamlessly with your Amazon Cloud services (books, music, movies, etc...) As a Prime member, I can also watch Prime movies in HD. For some unknown reason, Amazon does not allow Prime movies to be played in HD if using a PC - only devices such as the Roku, PS3, Xbox 360, and Kindle Fire allow playback in HD.The KFHD has a micro-USB and micro-HDMI port, with 3 buttons on the side for volume and power. I have a Belkin Chambray case that I first used, but it made the KFHD look and feel cheap. There are lots of cases on the market that use straps to hold the KFHD in place, and then another elastic strap to keep the cover in place. That just looks and feels cheesy. I opted to buy the Amazon KFHD leather case that uses the magnetic closure system. It is perfect! The magnetic flap is exactly what I was looking for! In addition, the buttons work perfectly through the case.The experience of watching a movie on the 7"" screen isn't that great. I prefer watching movies on a larger TV. I also found that reading a book on the KFHD hurt my eyes almost immediately. The lighter background on a LCD causes more strain than the e-ink/pearl screen on the Kindle Touch/Paperwhite. So essentially the KFHD is really more useful for reading magazines, browsing the web, playing games, and perhaps watching a movie/listening to music on the go.The KFDH 7"" has a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor with only 1GB of RAM. I can detect that it is slower than my Samsung Galaxy S3 (1.5 GHz dual-core with 2GB RAM), as it scores only about 6,500 points in Antutu while my Galaxy S3 is at 11,000 points. The screen on the KFHD is crisp. I am able to read magazines using Zinio. In the full page view, the text can be too small although it is good enough for me to skim to find interesting articles.Speaking of Zinio, the Amazon Appstore is probably the sorriest excuse for a marketplace that I've seen. Google Play has far more updated apps. The same apps in the Amazon Appstore are sometimes outdated by several generations, or they simply aren't in the Appstore. I had to sideload Zinio onto my KFHD.I opted to use a regular USB charger, and it takes awhile to fully charge the battery. However, in standby mode it sips power. Another good aspect with the Amazon Onyx case is that the magnetic closure puts the Kindle to sleep (or rather turns off the screen) when the cover is closed without having to do anything else. The battery life is acceptable - the screen is what uses the most power.Overall: 4/5 stars. I have to admit that it is overpriced for what it is, there are better Android-powered tablets (Nexus 7) at the same price point with more hardware power. The Amazon Appstore is sorely lacking compared to Google Play. The 1.2 GHz processor is fairly slow, and there's only 1 GB RAM. The lack of a SD card slot is also a mistake. If you want to read magazines without ever having to zoom in, the KFHD 8.9"" or a 10"" tablet is the answer, but I felt the 7"" is suitable because it is smaller, lighter, and easier to handle.Bottom line is that if you're interested primarily in Amazon content, the Kindle Fire HD is for you. The 8.9"" is best for reading magazines but the 7"" suits me fine. If you plan to root the KFHD, you're better off just buying an Android Tablet like the Nexus 7. The Nexus 7 and other tablets have better hardware (more RAM, faster processor, SD card slot, etc...) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4356, 4370)"
B000AJIF4E,electronics,How do you get so high?,"These are without doubt the best headphones I've ever owned.  The sound quality is incredible- rich and full without over-emphasizing any part of the sound spectrum.  Bass is amazing and brain scrambling.  Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.  I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them.  I consider these to be an incredible bargain worth every penny. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1561, 1575)"

B00DB3SH2G,electronics,What text do you prefer?,"Updated News as of April 3rd:Google is set to release the 2nd edition of the Nexus 7 in July 2013. Resolution is expected to be bumped up to 1920 x 1080, new Qualcomm Snapdragon processor for increased speed, 2 gigs of RAM, a back camera, and for the cellular plan, LTE. Pricing rumors haven't been released. So, if you can wait a few months, it's probably best to see what Google has in store for the Nexus 7 Second Edition before buying the currently offered Nexus 7.End of Update.Full Disclosure:I own an iPad 3 and an iTouch and a four, going on five year old Motorola dumb phone.I'm not going deep into hardware specs, you can read other reviews for that.[EDIT FOR NEWEST GOOGLE PRESS RELEASE]On October 29th, Google released the updated Nexus 7. The ONLY things that changed was that the 8gb version was discontinued, the 16gb version dropped to $199 and the 32gb version was released for $249 (both available for purchase NOW). The 3G cellular version is on sale starting November 13, 2012. Do not buy the existing Nexus 7 versions at current prices posted on Amazon! You're paying way too much.[/END EDIT]Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8gb and  16gb (the two flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.[SUPER BIG EDIT FOR HIGHLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION]:It's called USB On The Go. Essentially you take a USB OTG cable (like $1 on Ebay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Best $3 in credit I spent.With OTG and flash drives you don't need the cloud. Ever. Seriously, whoever decided to not put in the MicroSD to force cloud should be fired at Google.Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.As of today (10/5/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iTouch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad!2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad. It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not iPad well done, but save yourself $300 well done. It's fairly responsive, not iPad response, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. As for the screen separation, that seems to be more of an issue with the 16gb version than the 8gb. I haven't had any ghosting issues either.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixel is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app.4) Apps. True, the Apple ecosystems has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like skype, facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wifi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.[EDIT]: The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.[/Edit]6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google ""Install Flash On Nexus 7""The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7.If an iPad user like me can figure this out, you can too!Now on to other things:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network deadzones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn't.Jelly Bean isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with).Oh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.EDIT: On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10"" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like ""do I need an umbrella today?"" Ask ""Weather forecast (your location).""Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.EDIT: Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the ""NAvFree USA"" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying ""in 100 meters, turn right."" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.One thing: if you are a student planning on using this for notes, don't. The screen is way too small to actually take notes well and you need a blue tooth keyboard as well. Virtual on screen keyboard already eats up too much space. However, there is a speech to text and it might work well recording what your professor says. That said, you're better off with either the iPad or the Asus Transformer w/ keyboard. Or a real laptop.All in all I do like the tablet and often I'll reach for it over the iPad. Except when it comes to shopping online and browsing (and Facebook). The 7"" is simply too small to offer real competition to a 9~10"" screen. The use of keyboard via OTG alleviates this a bit but the screen is still really small.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so. Plus if you buy now you get $25 in Google Play credit and a transformers movie copy. Not the biggest of Michael Bay but $25 brings the actual cost quite down.Word of caution: the 16 GB versions seem to be affected by a poor manufacturing/QC issues. The 8 GB versions seem to have far fewer problems. If you're okay with OTG external storage, go with the 8 GB version as you're likely to have far less chance of getting a defective unit.One more annoying fact: If you root your device and get a custom recovery, you can't install over the air updates. Found this out the hard way. You have to manually install Android updates. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(11676, 11690)"

I am not new to photography and the peripherals that go with the business, I use to be in the video field, filming weddings,parties and everything else a customer needed. I decided to get into photography and extend my love for this media. I have been looking at numerous cameras including Canon, Nikon and a few others, I even thought about getting a full-frame camera but my budget thought otherwise. I scoured the reviews on said cameras and finally put my money down on the Canon Eos 7D. Boy am I glad I did! This fine instrument of art really shines. When you first pick it up you can feel the quality,the camera is laid out to make it easy for you to do your job. I purchased the kit with the 28-135 IS USM lens. I am still learning this fine camera but so far it has been a breeze to get to know, The menu is very imformative and if you know absolutely nothing about cameras you can start out by putting this in ""Full Automatic Mode"" The camera will make all the settings for you (iso,aperture n so on)but the fun begins when you open this beast up and put it into manual mode, go ahead and try it, the only way you will learn your camera is by trying different options in manual mode.

Want to fire several photo's in rapid sucession? the 7d does it very fast and with no problem . . . .however, in order to do this you need a fast memory card.

B0074BW614,electronics,Does the video and pictures extremely sharp?,"1st, I have the Kindle Fire HD 7"" with 32 GB of storage and ads enabled.If you are a book junkie, news junkie, or movie buff like me, then you will love the Kindle. You can carry around in your hand a whole library of large or small books and read them at your leisure, which can be just about anywhere. I think that aspect of it is great.There are also all kinds of games for it. I like a handful of the basic time-wasters, but otherwise I stay away from them.It does not have the basic card reader. It is designed with the idea that all of your storage will be on Amazon's Cloud Storage. Amazon gives you unlimited storage for the materials which you purchase from them, plus 5 GB for personal data. You can't transfer images from your favorite camera onto it, unless it has built-in WiFi (maybe). The Kindle is designed to rely only on it's built-in camera. I don't consider the built-in camera to be real great. Plus I consider the built-in camera awkward to use. It seems like the main idea of it is to take pictures of the user. Use with video calls and video conferencing would be ideal for it.Unlike the Netbooks, which were popular a couple of years ago, this tablet does not replace a computer in any sense of the word. You will still need a computer in addition to this tablet.Also, while I am on computer issues, Amazon's instructions say that this table will connect to any computer. This idea does not seem to be true with some computers and operating systems. My computer would be an example. The Kindle transfer system relies on the newest version of the Windows Media Player. I am running Windows 7-64 Premium on a 1 year old Toshiba. It has an AMD 64 bit processor and the 64 bit version of Windows 7. (Amazon and Microsoft both indicate that I am a minority with this choice.) I have the Windows Media Player on my computer. However, Microsoft gives me the message that the newest version of their Media Player will NOT run on my system. Apparently, my version of Windows Media Player is upgraded as far as Microsoft is going to upgrade it. (I never use it anyway.) It also appears that Kindle can not transfer files to my computer without the newest version. To get files from one computer to the other, it seems that I will have to email them to myself. (This is going to be a pain.)WiFi connections are problematic. That said, the Kindle version seems to be more problematic then most. I travel all over the USA. If you are in an area where there is a lot of WiFi routers, then the Kindle seems to get confused and refuses to work. Or you start running into security issues with everyone.I mentioned before that I am a movie buff. There is not room on it's internal storage to download a bunch of movies to it, and there is no external storage except on Amazon. I have even tried attaching an adapter and card reader card to it. This idea didn't work. Kindle won't recognize the card.I purchased a Bluetooth keyboard which works fine with it. But while I can pair up my computer to the Kindle with a Bluetooth connection, I still can not transfer files to/from my computer to the Kindle using it. (Don't know why, yet.)One thing that I have noticed is that this is a great idea to increase Amazon's business. I have purchased several apps and books from Amazon for it. Books are usually a lot cheaper to buy for use on Kindle. Apps are usually very cheap. And it is really nice to have a whole library to read at any given point where I have extra time. The built-in reader which reads books back to you is another great feature. I like have it read to me while I sit back and relax. (I am reminded of teachers asking me in high school if I was reading with my eyes closed and my head laying on the books.)Another issue that I have run into is the Kindle headphone-speaker plug. I am working trying to find out what works and what doesn't work with it. I have one set of headphones which will work with it, and they sound great. But most headphones and speakers won't work with it. The receiver socket of the plug-in area is recessed, and only a plug with an indented collar will make a connection. Standard speakers and headphones for other devices don't seem to work with it since their connecting plugs don't slide inside the socket far enough.The sound from the Kindle is great. The video is great. It is easy to read. There is a ton of things that you could do with it.In short, the Kindle is a great idea. But it still needs work.Update: Sept 18, 2013I have ordered many things from Amazon using my Kindle Fire HD.But it hit me that not all of the items available from Amazon will show up on the Kindle when browsing and placing orders. An example would be a jacket that I just received. I am a big person, and need big clothes. I ordered the largest size of a jacket that I liked using my Kindle Fire HD. It barely fits me. I looked at the jacket that I ordered on my home computer and saw that Amazon offers the jacket the next 2 sizes larger, and in additional colors. The additional larger sizes and colors where not showing on my Kindle when I placed the order.As I said before, the Kindle fine for reading books, magazines, and for a person's personal entertainment. In fact, it is great for that. But it does not replace a computer. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5268, 5282)"

By the way I have Windows 7 64  and I was up and running right away..so yes no problems with windows 7 /64 for those of you that might be wondering.The 2 extra buttons on the side are programmed to go back and forward which is what I already intended to use them for anyway. Someone said the location of the 2 buttons was bad but I don't see the problem .Even if your index finger (Which is used for 1 click)wereto brush up against the side buttons nothing would happen becasue they are sturdy enough for side swipes to not activate causing you to go backward or forward.  And of course the scroll wheel which works as intended. This is without installing the software. There's no software DVD but you can get it directly from Logitechs website if you choose.One thing I don't care for much is the blueball location which is for thumb use. I like theold version where you used your index finger.It's just easier to control with the index finger than the thumb . It's not a biggie no no and there's no problem controlling the blue ball but I rather myself using the index finger.It already comes with a battery (Only needs one) and a duracell to boot.There's 4 rubber feet on the bottom which hide the screws so I'm guessing it should be easy to clean if need to when you run out of warranty.What I'm really pissed about is the price..I ordered this 2 days ago and now the price is much cheaper. I'm going to email them to see if I can get credit...hey it's like $10 with shipping..even the shipping was more 2 days ago.Big plus no freaking long wire hanging off the side of my laptop !Bottom line I'm happy again :)PS:This vendor doesn't respond to emails..a simple yes or no was required of them but I guess customer service doesn't mean anything to them.----------------------------------------------------Edit: Nov 8th 2010This vendor never did reply to my request mentioned above.

B004GF8TIK,electronics,How much does a connector for my laptop cost?,"I have ordered 4 USB and 2 audio cables of the Mediabridge brand. I really like them thus far. The cable is a bit heavy but in a quality way. The stock cables that have come with my phones are thinner, lighter and not as bulky on the ends. I think this is a PRO and a CON. A PRO in that they have made the cable and end feel sturdy and solid but a CON in that it will carry a bit more weight against the charging port. I really don't see that as a major CON though, perhaps more of a description to give someone a better mental view without having a picture to directly compare (I did take pictures but its really hard to compare the Mediabridge to the stock as the size difference isn't a huge thing, but the way the Mediabridge cable feels makes me want it instead.). This cable has worked fine with my devices. I recommend this companies cables. I notice they had a car charger also and I plan to order one eventually. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(922, 936)"
B00BGGDVOO,electronics,How do you like the tv?,"Today is my first day with the Roku 3. I was able to find a factory refurb with a full warranty + included cables for about 15 bucks cheaper than the Roku 3 alone on Amazon. I'm using the money I saved to purchase an extended warranty. I love Amazon, but I recommend shopping around. I would have settled on the Roku 2 had I not found that deal! So, I basically paid a little over the price of a Roku 2 for a Roku 3 with cables, and once I buy the extended 2 year warranty, I'll have paid slightly more than a brand new Roku 3 with a weak 90 day warranty.Netflix became my main source of entertainment after I cut down on the amount of TV channels I have. Unfortunately, I rarely got to use Netflix after my good computer crashed. Since then, I've been operating an old nearly outdated laptop, and it works for most of my daily needs (social media, mostly) so I haven't felt the need to upgrade and replace it yet. However, it's had issues loading Netflix from time to time, so I began looking into streaming media players. That, plus the fact I have a nice flat screen I was gifted a couple Christmases back that's been going to waste. Why have a nice TV if all you can use it for is basic cable?Enter the Roku, the ideal option for someone who cares more about having content to watch (or listen to) than playing games or anything else. We have an Xbox in the living room which is fine and dandy, but I barely use it myself and it wasn't worth it to me to buy a gaming system for movies/TV alone when I could just buy a media player. Plus, the Roku does have some more simple games, like Angry Birds, which is really cool.Set up is simple, it boots up quickly and navigation is easy. If you have Netflix and Hulu you'll have more shows and movies than you could ever watch for under 20 bucks a month. I've been running the Hulu trial and will definitely be purchasing it when it runs out.I did have one issue where it locked up and reset itself already on day 1. I was worried that this was an issue because it was a refurb, but I did some investigative work and found out that it's a fairly common issue with Rokus and it's related to software, not hardware.I'm not too fussed about it, everything else is going fine, and if it becomes a recurring problem, well, that's what warranties are for.If you've got the extra money, the Roku 3 is great, though I was going to go with the 1 or 2 until I found a deal on the 3. I hear it has a better interface than the other models but I can't confirm, and there's also Youtube access, but that's said to be coming on the other models in the near future, so really, any Roku will serve the average consumer well! Just know that the 3 only has HDMI output option, so if you have an older TV, you'll need to go for the 1 or 2. You might be able to get it to work with an HDMI to analog converter, but I don't have firsthand experience with that.I don't know if it's worthy of the upgrade if you have another Roku, but if you're looking for a new one anyway and have the extra cash (as I said, if you look around you can get a refurb for cheaper with a fully warranty on a certain widely known competitor of Amazon), then I'd definitely get the Roku 3.

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,Where can I send to setup my device?,"I hooked this thing up today and have taken it for a test spin. Setup was quick and easy. Getting my browser to work with it took a little more fiddling, but that's just because I didn't want my work email associated with my youtube etc... nevermind. Anyway, Chromecast works basically as promised. It's sort of neat that I can pull up a youtube video on my phone or tablet or computer and get it playing on my big screen.It was apparent right away though that the image was cropped on my screen. I'm running a 1080p stream to a 1080p screen, and don't have this issue with my PS3, Xbox, Blu Ray player, or Boxee or Roku. I streamed my screen as well, and sure enough it wasn't a true representation of my laptop screen. Didn't matter what I streamed from either - I tried doing so from my phone, and the youtube video was cropped on all sides - looked zoomed in. I played around with my tv settings, and it didn't fix the issue. There's no settings to be found for fixing it either.Even zoomed in, it was a nice quick way to send youtube to my tv (even though I have other methods) - it's easily the fastest way considering the time it takes to fire up other devices. Hulu was also zoomed in, and the performance was choppy. I noticed I had to have the video playing in my laptop at the same time and I couldn't close the lid on my laptop. If I went full screen, Hulu would show full screen on my tv, but I couldn't do anything else with my laptop. The video on my laptop was not synced with the video on the screen. So if I want to watch hulu and do other stuff with my laptop, I have to watch it in the browser window which you can see on the tv screen rather than full screen. Full screen crops the video anyway though like I said, so there's really no good way to watch hulu I don't think. Unless I'm missing something.Netflix had the same issue as Hulu with the cropping and full screen. Youtube didn't have the full screen issue where I couldn't do anything else with my laptop... just the cropping.This is a decent little device for the price, but I probably won't use it for much besides youtube streaming. I'd say for what it costs, if you plan to only use it to stream Youtube, it's worth the money. Otherwise, save your hdmi port for something better. If I had a time machine, I would probably not buy it again since I don't really need it. In fact, I may relegate it to the bedroom tv that never really gets used. I'm going to hang on to it though to see if they release updates for it that make it better. So far, a pretty &#34;meh&#34; experience. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2563, 2577)"

B0027VT6V4,electronics,How is the end?,"My hopes were up, based on reviews, and my expectations were pretty low, based on price.  I'm a music lover, and my great set of computer speakers with a subwoofer just lost its 'woofer after ten years.  As I unwrapped these amazingly low priced units, I wondered if I would be surprised or disappointed -- and I got a bit of both.The speakers are smaller than they look on the web site, but they don't have a small sound for my purposes, namely, listening to a wide range of music while working.  The midrange and bass are good.  But the high ends are completely disappointing.  Is that hole at the top of the speakers a tweeter or just a decoration?  Either way, the high ranges are lacking -- no crispness at all.The net result sounds like it does with water in my ears, or when your ears don't pop during an airplane landing.  There is no treble control to fix the high ends, though the bass control lets you set the 'woofer at whatever level you want.Fortunately, my computer sound card has an equalizer that lets you change the sound.  With one of the sound profiles (""jazz"") the sound is tolerable, so I won't be sending these back.  At the price I paid, these will do until I spring for a replacement set -- maybe another cheap set recommended by others in this review section, or I'll just have to fork out more cash.

B0074BW614,electronics,Why is it a good hardware?,"This is my first Fire, so please bear in mind that I cannot contrast/compare to the Kindle Fire (traditional). I have numerous other Kindle e-readers, and work with numerous other Android and Apple tablets on a regular basis.First impressions - when it arrived today, it looked very sleek. Well-packaged, easy-to-open (unlike reports of the Nexus 7). No power plug, but I have it charging as I write this using a standard USB charging kit. Please note that if you plan on charging this device, you will (preferably) need a USB power adapter that supplies a full 2 Amps of current (or better). Otherwise, the unit will take forever to charge. And by forever, you can just check the FireHD's site out - 13 hours. Yeah. More than all night. No thanks. :) I personally believe that not including such an adapter was a wise cost-cutting move on Amazon's part... many of us already have a 2A charging adapter from other tablets/etc, and it cut $10 off the cost of the unit (or $20, if you didn't buy Amazon's special charger when you ordered the FireHD). By the way, my particular FireHD came charged to 68%.The size is perfect - it's got a good, solid feel, as well. Not too heavy, but heavy enough to let you know it's not a toy. The back is a nicely-textured matte finish. I don't like larger tablets that much, since it obviates one of the major advantages of a tablet in the first place (mobility). At iPad/Transformer sizes, I start to wonder why the person didn't just have a Netbook or regular laptop.Setup: The FireHD comes, as all first-bought Kindles should, pre-registered to your Amazon.com account. After power-on, the device asks for a wireless network, a timezone, and (optionally) Facebook/Twitter integration. That's it. Then it gets to the carousel/shelf interface and is instantly linked to your account's purchases. All my latest books, music, and videos were there, even those purchased earlier today, along with a Kindle Fire Welcome Guide. The device automatically updated itself after the first sleep I put it in.Incidentally, before the device arrived, I had pre-registered to remove the ads, for $15. From what I have heard on other Kindles, the ads are actually not very invasive or annoying, and actually can help pay for the Kindle over time through reduced prices or coupon offers. Me, I prefer an uncluttered and un-advertised-to interface, so I opted out. I think it was absolutely excellent of Amazon to offer this option in response to those who wanted out of that, but I would have been fine with them being there if there was no option to turn them off.Screen: The screen is gorgeous. Here, Amazon has learned from its competitors, who on their tablets used an application where the LCD panel is laminated/applied directly to the back of the cover glass. This allows the FireHD to have a clear, crisp screen no matter what the viewing angle. When I first powered the unit on, I cringed for a few seconds because it felt like the screen was too small - like I would feel cramped. This, however, was absolutely not the case, once the Kindle was active and into all the content, it was very open and inviting. I can only imagine how big the 8.9"" would be!In terms of usability for the touch-like nature of the display, this is the best tablet thus far I have ever used. Even light presses register properly. Many other tablets I've used are very particular about how hard you need to press or linger before registering. And yet, even with the ""hyper-sensitivity"" this device has, I have yet to have it register anything false (wrong button pushes), which are another hallmark of other tablets. Bravo, Amazon.Apps: The fire comes pre-loaded with OfficeSuite (a free version of a larger suite for editing documents), the Silk web browser, a Calendar, and various other supporting apps for things like Email, Contacts, IMDB, and Help. I like that they kept the initial load relatively free of bloatware (MOTOROLA: TAKE A HINT PLEASE!!!). I personally do not like the lack of some applications on the Amazon App Store... for instance, I would have liked to load Firefox or Chrome, but they are not there. Also, a link for Skype is on there but the app is not pre-loaded.Books read well on this, and this being my first Fire, I like the interface for reading books, though I definitely prefer e-readers for eyestrain reasons. It's nice that the FireHD has text-to-speech, especially since the PaperWhite lost this functionality (which I think was a great move; that device is an e-READER, not e-audibleprovider). The three backgrounds should help users with some of the eyestrain for limited periods of reading.I have not yet connected this to my corporate Exchange servers, and quite honestly I may not bother. But it's nice to know that's an option. Email for Gmail works well, with an occasional ""stutter"" to the interface while it's loading something from the web (see my comment in the next paragraph for Performance). I doubt I will do much email from this device, but again, it's nice to know that it's there, in a pinch.Performance: The processor is fast. It's not perfectly smooth, but reasonable. The vast majority of the lag, from what I have seen, revolves around network operations. Basically, if a screen has to load an image, or some other content, from the Internet or Amazon, the device can, and will, ""stutter"" occasionally. I guess there could be adjustments done to the interface to avoid this, but the fact is that to me, it isn't distracting from the experience. Temple Run and various other games run very smoothly on the device. I know it's about to sound harsh, but I would expect nothing less from an Android 4.0-based device. :)The storage (I got the 16GB version) is adequate for what I will use it for - mostly media streaming from the Web, plus some locally installed apps, games, and side-loaded books. Anything else will be on the Cloud. If you're a heavy movie watcher and want them loaded on the device itself (perhaps you would use this on a bus or commuter train), you may want to wait until October for the 32GB version; the $50 difference would be worth it, then.Wireless: Out of the box, Bluetooth is disabled (which is a good thing, don't want anyone hacking our precious new toy, now do we?). Since I have not been able to get Flash, I cannot benchmark the wireless (TWCable and Speedtest.net use Flash). Huh, now I know what it's like to use an Apple product. :) However, all file transfers happen as fast as most other wireless hardware I have around the house, and video streaming of HD looks crisp and clear. Video playback looks clean and the controls are easy to use.Buttons/Interface: I don't like where they placed the camera on the device. I personally think it should be on the other side, so that the camera is ""up"" when put in a case that allows for stand-up (though, this might be my case - but I don't see how they could have easily engineered around it). The camera provides a good, clear picture for video conferencing after a brief Skype test, and appeared to operate fairly well in low light, which is encouraging for me, since many areas in my house aren't adequately lit (hence my additional order for a Kindle PaperWhite :)). The interfaces on the unit are the speakers (which are decent, but don't expect huge bass or amazing sound from tiny speakers), USB and HDMI out (THANK YOU AMAZON! The HDMI interface, ALONE, should sway folks to this platform over other tablets!), the headphone jack (which is well-placed, not too near a corner and not recessed as early iPhones were), and the power and volume rocker buttons.Quite honestly, the only poor thing about the device is the power and volume rocker buttons. They are flush with the chassis, have little gap between them and the chassis, and are the same color as the chassis (black). This means that, every time I sleep the unit or adjust volume, I'm squinting at the top of the Fire to figure out where the heck the buttons are. While it is, technically, possible to ""feel"" your way to the buttons, it's impractical - since the volume rocker buttons have a tiny raised edge which ""announces"" their presence, but they are not differently-sized (smaller nubbin for ""lower volume"", larger nubbin for ""increase volume""). I think that, in time, the power button will be easier to find, since it's smack-dab-in-the-middle of the top, but for now, it's kind of a hunt, especially with a case on. I would have preferred a raised button. But believe me, this is a very minor complaint on an otherwise excellent interface implementation.Here's where the ""religious war"" starts. First off, I refuse to compare tablets purely on a hardware basis as, inherently, a contest of ""this one is best."" That's a technological no-win situation. Also, I firmly believe that, as a technology, tablets (of all kinds, not just the FireHD), since their inception, have been a solution looking for a problem. They are jack-of-all-trades, master of none. They are neat gadgets, but in and of themselves, they cannot do a tenth of what an average Netbook or laptop computer is capable of, and with current price points for decent laptops in the $400-500 range, it's hard to justify a tablet based on hardware alone. And I'm glad that Bezos and others at Amazon ""get"" this - I can't tell you how many friends and family members I know that own tablets, and never use them - because they want a keyboard and mouse.Here's where the FireHD shines. I think that the perfect niche for a tablet, where it can have a chance to be a ""master"" as opposed to a ""master of none"" - is in the singular application of being a multimedia consumption device. When a user wants to read a book, listen to music, watch a movie - they want a simple, point-and-shoot interface. And a tablet provides not only the interface, but the mobility.Conclusions:I feel that the FireHD is really what tablet users should be looking for. We should be looking at a device that provides easy, mobile access to an ecosystem of rich media, with features and accessibility that make it easy to use and enjoy. The Amazon ecosystem is amazing - having been a Kindle e-reader user for years, and now a Prime member with all the media perks that entails, I love how the media I purchase is available anywhere, on any platform. I think this device is a perfect complement to that experience; especially with the HDMI-out and Bluetooth capabilities, which allow this device to be a multimedia powerhouse at home or on the road.The only ""downsides"" I see in this device are the slightly-difficult-to-address buttons, the lack of an option to remove/disable the carousel, a Collections for Books feature (after 100 books, it's tough sometimes to organize things and find what you want to read), and the ability to set a custom screen background while on sleep. Since three of these four are software-based, I'm hoping they can be addressed in future software. In the meantime, these do not significantly impact my enjoyment of my device.Anyone seriously considering a tablet, especially one that takes full advantage of the Amazon ecosystem, should be considering this device. It is solid, performs well, and has a rich set of features that a $199 price tag makes all the more amazing. I think that, for $200, you would be hard-pressed to find a better way of enjoying Amazon's content offerings.(By the way, after finishing the typing of this review, the device is at 92%, which is awesome charging speed. It's great, again, that Amazon doesn't force you to use their chargers, unlike SOME OTHER manufacturers. :)) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(11580, 11594)"

B0074BW614,electronics,What is the price of the display?,"Kindle Fire HD 7""Having been an Android and iOS user for the past few years (iPod Touch, iPhone, Motorola Droid2, Samsung Galaxy S3, Kindle Touch, Motorola MotoACTV), I've been anxious to try a Kindle Fire. Going in, I knew it wouldn't be a pure Android ecosystem nor would it have the latest in hardware. I looked at the Google Nexus 7 (Asus) and a Google Nexus 10 as well as the Asus Transformer tablets. The positive aspects of those tablets mainly focus on the Android operating system. Since I'm a fairly heavy consumer of Amazon products and services, the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) isn't a bad choice.It's easy to navigate, although the Carousel is rather annoying than useful. I prefer Android Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean as it allows far more flexibility and customization. That said, KFHD 7.2.3 is actually based on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, according to Antutu Benchmarks.The Silk Web Browser works much like any other Android browser, and the Kindle Fire integrates seamlessly with your Amazon Cloud services (books, music, movies, etc...) As a Prime member, I can also watch Prime movies in HD. For some unknown reason, Amazon does not allow Prime movies to be played in HD if using a PC - only devices such as the Roku, PS3, Xbox 360, and Kindle Fire allow playback in HD.The KFHD has a micro-USB and micro-HDMI port, with 3 buttons on the side for volume and power. I have a Belkin Chambray case that I first used, but it made the KFHD look and feel cheap. There are lots of cases on the market that use straps to hold the KFHD in place, and then another elastic strap to keep the cover in place. That just looks and feels cheesy. I opted to buy the Amazon KFHD leather case that uses the magnetic closure system. It is perfect! The magnetic flap is exactly what I was looking for! In addition, the buttons work perfectly through the case.The experience of watching a movie on the 7"" screen isn't that great. I prefer watching movies on a larger TV. I also found that reading a book on the KFHD hurt my eyes almost immediately. The lighter background on a LCD causes more strain than the e-ink/pearl screen on the Kindle Touch/Paperwhite. So essentially the KFHD is really more useful for reading magazines, browsing the web, playing games, and perhaps watching a movie/listening to music on the go.The KFDH 7"" has a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor with only 1GB of RAM. I can detect that it is slower than my Samsung Galaxy S3 (1.5 GHz dual-core with 2GB RAM), as it scores only about 6,500 points in Antutu while my Galaxy S3 is at 11,000 points. The screen on the KFHD is crisp. I am able to read magazines using Zinio. In the full page view, the text can be too small although it is good enough for me to skim to find interesting articles.Speaking of Zinio, the Amazon Appstore is probably the sorriest excuse for a marketplace that I've seen. Google Play has far more updated apps. The same apps in the Amazon Appstore are sometimes outdated by several generations, or they simply aren't in the Appstore. I had to sideload Zinio onto my KFHD.I opted to use a regular USB charger, and it takes awhile to fully charge the battery. However, in standby mode it sips power. Another good aspect with the Amazon Onyx case is that the magnetic closure puts the Kindle to sleep (or rather turns off the screen) when the cover is closed without having to do anything else. The battery life is acceptable - the screen is what uses the most power.Overall: 4/5 stars. I have to admit that it is overpriced for what it is, there are better Android-powered tablets (Nexus 7) at the same price point with more hardware power. The Amazon Appstore is sorely lacking compared to Google Play. The 1.2 GHz processor is fairly slow, and there's only 1 GB RAM. The lack of a SD card slot is also a mistake. If you want to read magazines without ever having to zoom in, the KFHD 8.9"" or a 10"" tablet is the answer, but I felt the 7"" is suitable because it is smaller, lighter, and easier to handle.Bottom line is that if you're interested primarily in Amazon content, the Kindle Fire HD is for you. The 8.9"" is best for reading magazines but the 7"" suits me fine. If you plan to root the KFHD, you're better off just buying an Android Tablet like the Nexus 7. The Nexus 7 and other tablets have better hardware (more RAM, faster processor, SD card slot, etc...) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4356, 4370)"

B000AZ57M6,electronics,How to claim cash?,"I first bought the Canon EF 28-135mm IS lens to use with my Canon 10D along with theCanon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 Zoom Lens. About four years later I have sold all my original purchases.  The Canon EF 28-135mm was my most used lens, and I still had it until March 2006 when I replaced it with the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L.Being an L lens, the dust and moisture resistant construction of the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sturdy.  The lens consists of eighteen elements in thirteen groups including one Super-UD glass element and three aspherical lenses to minimize chromatic aberration and distortion.  With a standard twist zoom focus, this lens permits for auto or manual focusing depending on how the switch is set.Some of the earlier lenses had an issue that caused lens flare.  This issue was resolved quickly with a recall.  If the control number located on the back cover of the lens begins with a UT and the following number is less than 1,000, then the lens is affected and should be sent in for repair.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L lens is compact measuring 5 inches long and lightweight weighing in at about 1.5 lbs/670g, and accepts 77mm filters.  Be sure to get agood quality UV haze filterto protect the front lens element. Not only do I see this as a good practice, Canon recommends doing so on their site as well.  The f/stop ranges from 4 - 22. The closest focusing distance is 18 in/45 cm. In addition, the lens has a USM drive mechanism for optimum AF performance, and the pulse control diaphragm (EMD) ensures precise aperture control.The IS system is composed of a pair of gyro sensors to detect vertical and horizontal motion and a microprocessor that compensates for it by shifting special lens elements in parallel with the perceived movement. It is recommended that the IS be off when shooting on a tripod. I have used the IS on myBogen 3231 monopod with legssuccessfully. A monopod is not as stable as a tripod though, with or without the legs. Using the IS, you can obtain sharp pictures three stops below where you normally would. This is a huge advantage in dim light or places where flash is prohibited. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed.A distance scale ring sits below the focus ring. Turn the distance scale ring all the way to the left and you are set for low magnification close-up photography. Turn it to the right and you are able to set for infinity compensating for changes in temperature as necessary. The distance scale includes figures in red as an infrared index to use when shooting black and white infrared film. Shooting infrared is not available on all cameras. If this feature is a must, make sure this lens is compatible for infrared photography on your camera body.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L includes a 1 Year US Warranty, the front & rear lens caps, theLP1219 soft pouch, and theEW-83H lens hood.  The hood will decrease chances of lens flare and increase metering accuracy. If you use filters, Canon recommends against stacking.The Canon EF 28-135mm lens is similar in build a little shorter and weighs a couple ounces less.  Of course the Canon EF 28-135mm has a wider focal range.  Both lenses have single mode IS capabilities, and are good walkabout lenses.  Having used the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L the difference in weight and length is hardly noticeable.  The shorter focal distance is not missed, and I have a constant f/4 through out the focal scale unlike the Canon EF 28-135mm with a 5.6-36 on the long focal range.  The images using the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sharper and clearer than those using the Canon EF 28-135mm.If the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4.0L IS lens' price is not a problem, this is the lens to get. Otherwise purchase and enjoy the28-135mm IS lens.  The great thing about Canon lenses is they tend to hold their value.  If you want to upgrade from the 28-135mm, sell it on a popular auction site like I did.PROS:A compact L standard IS zoom that is an excellent walkabout lens.Versatile multipurpose lensCONS:A price typically found on L lensesMay become your most used lens ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4138, 4152)"

B004T9RR6I,electronics,How is the service performance?,"My trusty many-years-old WRT45G seemed to be going out every now and then so it seemed the right time to switch out. Right away, I noticed the range and speed were lower than what I was used to with the WRT45G. My wireless laptop would get 4-5 bars connection strength with the WRT45G, with the E1200 I get 3-4 at most. My download speed fell 6 Mbps (!) according to the speedtest website, though my upload speed was unaffected - I don't download a terrible large amount of stuff or run multiple internet reliant applications at once so this does not have too much impact on me personally at the moment, but it might concern me over time if I increase my internet usage and the speed loss becomes an issue. I know the loss in speed is due to the new router since when I reconnected my old router the speed went back up. There might be settings to ""tweak"" that would improve the speed, but I am admittedly not particularly tech-savvy, and as far as connecting routers go, I follow the basic instructions and leave it at that since it seems to have worked for me that way all these years. The E1200 also runs warmer than my WRT45G. The temperature is not enough to concern me about being ""too"" warm, but it is noticeable, vs what I would call the ""not worth noticing"" temperature the WRT45G used to run at. The E1200 is actually the piece running warmest out of all my Internet devices (Cisco CM100 modem, OBi110) I leave on 24/7.The only real advantage the E1200 has for me over the WRT45G is the appearance. It is nearly 1/2 as thick and much more appealing to look at without the antennae and sleek black exterior. The E1200 router has worked steadily without issues, but since I don't need to worry about appearance so much since I stick all my devices where they can't be seen, I would rather stick to the old WRT45G.One word of advice for when you're setting up the router for the very first time - make sure not to plug the router in and/or connect any cables until you get to the screen (after inserting setup CD and launching) where it tells you to do so.. I jumped the gun and went into it with the router already plugged in and every time the setup would error out. It took me a few times to realize I had to have it unplugged, etc for it to setup correctly (need to practice more patience ^_^;). ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2306, 2320)"

B00FFJ0HUE,electronics,How much is the amount of sony?,"The ASUS Transformer Book T100 delivers a ton of value in a mostly compelling package. The beauty of today's computing devices is that consumers are no longer forced to buy one-size-fits-all, and instead, have the choice to buy what best fits their needs. I've used the ASUS T100 (64GB) over the past couple of days, and while I wouldn't consider it powerful/comfortable enough as primary computing device, I think it makes great sense as a secondary machine, especially with the advances in cloud storage.From my perspective, the ASUS T100 is basically a tablet with the ability to become a mini-notebook. Whether you will love or hate it strongly depends on what your intended application and expectations are. I plan to use the ASUS T100 for both work and recreation, with note-taking, email, web browsing, presenting, and video playback being the most common tasks, and from my initial impression, it does these jobs quite well. While I found the keyboard a bit too cramped for my liking (smaller-than-normal keys + tighter spacing + my big hands = not very happy), and wasn't too keen on the touch/clickpad (doesn't always respond to the first touch, two-finger scrolling can be a bit jerky, loud and hollow-sounding click), it wasn't a deal-breaker considering the price point. The keyboard dock is really usable, and I appreciated having it when I was typing longer emails and editing office documents.The ASUS T100 features a Intel Atom Z3740 Quad-Core processor which is exceptionally power efficient and much better performing than previous Atoms, though it is still slow compared to traditional notebook/ultrabook processors. For example, the year-old ""low-end"" Pentium 2117U, rated at 17W TDP, is more than twice as fast as the Atom Z3470 in single-threaded workloads though it can also draw ~4X more power. The Z3740 is pretty even with the Pentium in multi-threaded workloads, through the slower single-threaded performance will be more evident with slower app/program launches, etc.At the end of the day, I like the ASUS T100. ASUS has developed many 2-in-1 transforming solutions in the past and its expertise shows in the T100 ~ while made of the plastic, the overall build quality and precision is good for the price. I more or less agree with the specifications such as as the CPU and 64GB of eMMC, though I think 2GB of RAM is too stingy, especially since it cannot be upgraded later. Overall, I think the ASUS Transformer Book T100 is a much needed breath of fresh air and I'm excited about the future possibilities.Notes:1) Compared to the ARM versions of Microsoft's Surface RT and upcoming Surface 2 (non-pro), the ASUS T100 offers an exceptional value proposition by bundling Office 2013 and being compatible with regular Windows software.2) For my own computing needs, I found the combination of a portable machine with good battery life, paired with a powerful desktop to be ideal. The ""good-enough"" performance of the ASUS T100 along with great battery life and ability to fall back to full-blown Windows makes it well suited for this role.3) Web Browsing and Document editing on Microsoft platforms is generally a great experience. Internet Explorer on both Modern and Desktop modes is fully functional and delivers a rich web experience with Flash, Javascript, HTML5, etc. Office 2013 allows for native viewing and editing of documents which is something iOS and Android sometimes have difficulty with.4) Office 2013 Home and Student is pre-installed and includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and One Note. A serial number for activation is in the box.5) The charging cable is Micro USB but is very short by laptop standards. It attaches to the tablet side instead of the keyboard dock. The USB port on the keyboard dock is on the LEFT side.6) The Windows 8.1 UI feels very fluid though App/Program launches can be sluggish.7) Free space on the 64GB version is ~ 37GB. Windows 8 has a built-in recovery mechanism which allows you to re-install/repair Windows or remove all user files.8) The T100 supports Microsoft's Connected Standby feature which means it only sips power in the suspend state so you don't need to turn it on/off frequently. Modern Apps such as email are refreshed periodically even in suspend so the live tiles are ""fresh"" when you resume the system. Resume from suspend is nearly instantaneous. It should be noted that desktop apps are suspended during Connected Standby so they are not refreshed.9) Boot times are quick ~ the system can boot to the start screen in &lt;10 seconds.10) A full-sized USB port on the tablet would have been highly appreciated...Hopefully a future version will have multiple USB ports!11) Slightly Annoying: The Windows button on the front/bottom of the tablet doesn't do anything! The only way to get back to the Start screen from the desktop is either to hit the Start Button or use the charms.12) Battery life is really quite good. I haven't run it down from 100% to zero but 8 hours of light use is very doable. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4991, 5005)"

I have used the lens at a Fly-In at the local airport.  I was able to zoom in as planes landed and you can see the pilot's faces as they were landing.  Also you could get great shots of the aircraft taking off and get several shots  after they were in the air.  The shots were always sharp no matter how far the subject was away from the camera.  I remember from the old AT-1 zoom, the further the object was away from the camera the more a tripod was needed.  Not with this lens.  The IS worked very nicely and every shot was sharp.

B00752R9SM,electronics,How is the 3d rendering?,"I've been a fan of Samsung for years and this is the first time I've strayed from my usual brand. When comparing the features on this TV to a similar Samsung you will pay $300-$400 more. I wasn't sure what to expect with this TV and honestly I was ready to dislike it from the start. Now that I've been using mine for about a month I feel I can give a solid review. Sure, this TV is not top of the line, but it has some features you will find on much higher priced sets.Pros- This TV is thin! You can hang it on the wall and it looks like a picture frame on the wall. All the connections are strategically placed that make doing just this possible!- Built in WiFi! I've always hated the idea of having to run a network cable to where I have my TV. It just isn't practical. My PS3 and Xbox are wireless so that's how I've compensated over the past few years. Having the ability to stream without an external source directly from Netfilx or Amazon has made this TV really handy.- The passive 3D has been amazing! I thought I really wanted a TV with active 3D, but the wider viewing angle of the passive 3D and not having to worry about battery powered glasses was a big selling point for me to go passive. Sure the TV snobs will tell you that you are not seeing each frame in Full 1080P with the passive, but we've gotten to the point where the human eye can't even tell so I'm not paying more for something I wouldn't even notice! The 2D to 3D feature is pretty cool too, but the way I'd describe that is that instead of the picture coming out at you, the TV seems to be like a window that you are looking into. The true 3D does come right out of the set at you and I can't believe there isn't more 3D content for how amazing it is to have in your home. The nice thing about the passive 3D is that you just take home your glasses from the latest 3D movie in the theater and they work with your set!- The sound has been impressive. Sure it's not amazing, but I have heard much worse from stock TV speakers. I did hook mine up to surround sound but still use the TV speakers 80% of the time and they have done just fine.Cons:- I'm not sure but I believe this TV only has a single core processor. It's most obvious when searching through the smart TV menus. It just seems like the TV needs more processing power to truly be used as a smart TV that could replace your computer for surfing the web. I've added a wireless logitech keyboard and it has made the smart TV functions so much easier to use! Trying to key in a basic internet search with the stock remote is just down right painful!- Soap Opera Effect (SOE). I've heard many people talk about SOE and Panasonic TVs and didn't understand until I've seen it regularly. It's hard to explain, but some TV shows like Dramas actually look more realistic then they are probably meant to, so they look a lot like the camera movements you would see watching a soap opera. While I've listed this as a Con, it's actually started to grow on me.- No built in camera. The TV has Skype as one of the apps, but without an external camera you can't even use it to make calls. The camera is required to use the app which I don't fully understand. I can make skype calls on my computer without turning the camera on, why can't I do the same on my TV?- The power indicator light is in a horrible location. It is a bright red LED right in the center on the bottom. In a dark room it is so obvious, I don't know why they placed this where they did, but I have noticed I've started blocking it out. At first it was a major annoyance and I almost covered it up with a small piece of tape!I don't think you can find a TV with more features for this price and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would consider a Panasonic in the future if I am ever looking to upgrade again.Update 11/24/12It truly is a 120 HZ refresh rate set and they get to 360 HZ by playing with the backlighting from what I understand.  In comparing to other sets I would compare this to other 120 HZ sets.  I am not aware how many bits the panel is and I have tried to ind this info without any luck.  I personally have had zero issue with any edge light bleeding.  The edge of my set is perfectly uniform and with the room dark and a dark scene there is no bleed through.  I honestly didn't want to like this set as my fianc&eacute;e picked it as an engagement gift for me and I was looking at samsungs that cost much more.  5 months later we still both love the set and the only thing I wish is that we would have gone bigger than the 42"".  We were even considering upgrading to the 55"" when it was in the Black Friday deal a couple nights ago but I didn't pull the trigger.  Hope this helps! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4700, 4714)"

Both of those work great on both devices. Come to think of it, I didn't try viewing my Amazon Prime movie on the Nexus. My main use is web browsing, books, music and video files. The new Nexus has speakers that sound pretty much just as nice (and loud) as the KFHD. There might be a difference in screen resolution, but my eyes can't tell - both screens look bright and sharp.Books - Text to speech on Amazon Kindle books only works on the KFHD.

I took a few days to decide what device was best for me, and thanks to the people I work with I had a chance to compare the Kindle Fire HD and a Nexus 7 side by side.Comparison, Performance wise they are a very close match, I would say the Nexus is slightly faster over all. but not enough that it would matter in the end. my deciding factor was the Amazon experience. I wanted that User Interface, where I see what I am looking for as soon as I turn on the device. I did not want the  distractions of other games and apps to have the chance to prevent me from reading the books that I bought the tablet for. So I ended up getting the Kindle Fire at Best Buy a few days later.since I have picked up the Kindle Fire HD I have found that I use it to watch YouTube and Netflix a lot while cooking or being in the kitchen. I also take it with me where ever I go, I can get amazing Wifi signal when in the city. Thanks to the Dual-Band Wifi in this thing I get better signal than I do on my laptop.

There are 3 alternative firmware versions available that will all work on this router so if the stock asus firmware is not fitting the bill you have a choice of Merlin, Tomato or DD-WRT.  At this point however a simple update to the latest Asus firmware resolve my problem and the router has been stable since that time.There are some other things I do not like about the Asus software:Parental Controls - The only option here is to set a calendar of access times.  The Web 2.0 interface is awkward and you must set a different schedule for each MAC address.  I found it time consuming and problematic.  I would have preferred to create an access class assign the schedule to the access class and then assign the MAC address to the class.  But at least I was able to disable WIFI during nighttime hours so my children aren't watching HULU or worse all night in bed.Static IP - While it gives you the ability to create leases, you cannot name them.  And as such the DNS from the router will not serve a name for them.  This has been a feature I have used for a while and has been available on every previous router that I have purchased.  It makes it easy to setup a static entry for my ReadyNAS, and networked Xerox printer and then access them in a browser by name instead of IP.  All of the alternative firmwares provide this capability so I will likely switch to one of them, going to try Merlin first as it has the best performance.QoS - I really don't get it, why would you invent your own version of QoS when a standard 802.11Q already exists and would make your device compliant with other devices that also support the standard such as my 24 port gigabit switch.  The lack of this feature has effectively nullified the capability on my 24 port switch as I have no congestion within the switch, only when accessing the internet.  Instead they provide a very dumbed down custom QoS implementation that has been very buggy by all reports.  I am hoping that I might be able to get 802.11q with DDWRT or Tomato, but doubt that Merlin will provide it.In general the interface is just simplified, and it is clear that it was intended for the novice user.  Some advanced features are available, but for the most part it is designed for the non-technical user.To be clear, I find the problems above endemic across all SOHO offerings.  They are adequate, but dumbed down for grandma to the point they do not work the way a technologist would expect.  Based on the performance I am seeing with update firmware, I can highly recommend this if you need a Dual Band WIFI router, I have deducted 1 star because you will need to flash the firmware to get it to be stable.

One of those is one of the device buttons, for the DVD device, where I had programmed the Roku.  So I moved that to the Aud decive button, and now I have a 6 component remote.  More annoying was the up channel button now isn't working.  OK, so I reprogrammed the fav button just above that to act as a channel up.  Hard to give more than 3 stars though, given these issues, though the design and features are nice.  It also was some trouble to program for the Roku; it would be much better if there were a preset for this.  Since I have the Roku 2 XS, which ships with a bluetooth remote, I had to purchase the basic remote from Roku just to have something to program this with.Aside from that, no real complaints.  Some of the buttons are a little tough to read in lower light, basically black buttons with greyish text.  But the back light button takes care of that, lighting up that text in bright red.

B004N866SA,electronics,How is it bezel?,"The picture quality, colors, contrast and clarity of this television is nothing short of jaw dropping; just amazing really, especially since we upgraded from a 15 year old CRT-TV. It took us a while to get the thing set up, entering account info and registering for the various services but connecting to my wireless network was relatively simple and the TV downloaded an important update right after initial connection was made. Pairing the remote required that I hold the remote pretty close to the hot spot on the lower right corner of the TV but once paired, it worked flawlessly. My Time Warner cable remote however, still is not properly synched and connected to my new Samsung components so I may need to call Time Warner on this; the synch codes I used and the auto synch process did not fully work.Netflix is not what it used to be; the service seems to have only older movies and not the 'just released' films. This, along with nearly intolerable rebuffering pauses and an annoying black flash blip which happens every 3 mins or so makes me wonder if Netflix is really worth the subscription fee anymore. I ordered a new Apple Airport Extreme to upgrade to the new dual band technology so I am hoping that this fixes this rebuffering and drop out problems otherwise it is not likely that I will go past the free trial of Netflix. Blu-rays and DVDs look fantastic on this TV played on my new Samsung BD-D5500. The TV automatically connects to the Blu-Ray and switches ports when you turn it on. Cool.You need to play with the settings on the TV before you know what you like in terms of picture and sound. I was very impressed with the built-in sound of this TV, clearly upgraded over previous models, but I picked up an audio Y-cable and connected the TV directly to my stereo receiver's tape deck 'in' port and now when I activate the receiver's 'Tape' button, I get crystal clear stereo sound to go with my amazing picture. Even though this system supports surround sound 5.1 I am not missing it. The 3D features of this TV are mind-blowing but it does give you a headache after a while; you can sense the flicker of the battery powered glasses. Not all 3D discs are equal, some are a let-down and despite the hype, you likely won't end up watching 3D programming very often. The 3D starter kit comes with 2 pair of glasses and there's a coupon to get two more pair for free by mail so at least it's not too expensive for everyone to get the taste of 3D when they want it. The 2D picture though is beyond incredible. The bezel is unbelievably thin and the TV itself is very very thin and relatively lightweight. Stand is heavy and stable; ports are clearly marked but there is very little room to plug in the HDMI cables at back, especially since the pro cable I got for the Blu-Ray has a magnetic shield barrel on the cable and this presses against the back of the TV and seems to slightly bend the port so it is better to use HDMI cables that lay flat.The Samsung apps work pretty well but they are clearly still young and need development. I spent nearly two years researching TVs and am very happy I got this Smart-TV model. Dynamic LED backlighting was a key feature for me, there is absolutely no flashlighting or ghosting, blacks are deep and solid.

I'll list a few pros and cons and then talk about what I think of the product overall.Pros-Easy to use, feels amazing. It uses a usb stick to do everything, although you do need to have your own charger cable as it doesn't come with one (USB to mini usb). The headset is very comfortable and has plushy padding on the ear cups and head band. I have no problem wearing these for lengthy gaming sessions (3 hours or more) or watching a couple movies in a row.-Packs a lot of sound, for it being virtual 7.1 it sounds great but not amazing. If you're used to high end headsets/headphones this might not be the thing for you, but if you're looking to save some money and still have a decent headset then you definitely want to pick this up. The stereo sounds good, but the virtual surround sound is the way to go.-Looks fantastic, this is one of the better looking headsets I've owned. It might not be for everyone, but I really like the design of this.-Absolutely wireless, this is a huge plus for me as I hate having to deal with wires.-I've talked with friends over games and over skype and they all say that the mic sounds good, but for skype I normally use my Blue Snowball USB mic anyway.Cons-Controls for sound/volume are weird. There are two control slides, one for game/movie volume and one for voice chat (in game). When I'm playing with friends and we're in an intense game, sometimes I'll need to adjust the headset so I can hear them better rather than the game volume. I've noticed that it's just easier to take off the headset entirely and change it that way that moving my hand behing my head in a somewhat awkward position. It's not a deal breaker by any means buts till annoying.-While I complimented the sound in the pros, I need to mention it in the cons as well. It's not going to blow you away, the virtual surround is good but it's still virtual. I've noticed the highs are great, the mids are awesome, but the lows are just alright.Those are the main points I wanted to make, but I also want to note that before this headset I owned a pair of Tritton AX Pros. The Tritton's were beast, had great sound and a great sounding mic. They weren't without fault though as they were really heavy on my head. Felt like a full pound or so, while this Sony headset is really light and feels great on the ears. The Tritton's also required a whole slew of wires to be attached and taken off then reattached: it was a mess. The number one reason for me getting this Sony headset is because it's wireless, the second was the amazing price. The sound is about 3.75 stars, while the price bumps it to about 4.5. I would like to give it a 4.5 star rating but Amazon doesn't allow .5 increments, and it's definitely not a 5 star headset so 4 stars will have to do.I hope this rather long review helps you in your buying process.Z ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2947, 2961)"

It has a quality look and feel to it. As soon as I powered it on, the first thing I did was update the firmware. That was a very easy process.Pros:The user management interface is very nice and user friendly.Performance is amazing! I have it hooked up to a static gateway, which splits up my modem's connection to two other routers. The bandwidth tests I have ran over WiFi with the Asus are showing higher speeds on average than the other router which the PC's are physically connected to via Ethernet. That alone is pretty impressive. It'ss also very reliable and I haven't had any problems with it till this point. Still early, but only time will tell. The WiFi range is very strong. Two previous wireless N routers did not even come close to the range I am getting with the Asus. And even at the edge of the range, the bandwidth is still decent.Cons:Some parts in the QOS section were a little confusing, but Asus support was able to clear up the confusion for me after an email.

B000R5LWRI,electronics,What is the quality of the product?,"I am upgrading our house network to increase transfer speeds between all our devices and to implement a more robust backup scheme.  Chose the ASUS Black Knight N66U router as our primary networking device, a dual band 450 Mbps device, which then led to the need for higher speed wireless adapters on a few key computers to take advantage of the higher router speeds, and after much research, chose the TRENDnet 450's to match the router specs.  Have installed these on work laptop and audio workstation desktop so far, and will purchase another for home server when get that up and running.Honestly, I've been moving away from the old stalwarts like Netgear, Dlink, and especially LinkSys (after Cisco acquisition), as I don't think they are on the leading edge of performance, reliability, and ease of use any more.  TRENDnet, on the other hand, seems to be on the rise, and offering good price/performance, especially on the adapter side.  Had a TRENDnet 300 Mbps 2.4GHz dongle that worked very well, so that and reviews led me to the 684UB.Conclusion, the TRENDnet 684UB is an very good low priced choice!  However, for MAXIMUM throughput, get the slightly more expensive but worth it Asus USB-N66ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-N900 USB Network Adapter (USB-N66)First and foremost, am getting much higher link speeds than via old N and G adapters linked to my previous dual band N router (Netgear WNDR3700 dual band 300Mbps).  Am seeing up to the rated 450 Mbps link speed with the TRENDnet 684UB working with the Asus Black Knight, especially on 5GHz band, and had never exceeded 100 Mbps with previous setup.  2.4 GHz link speeds are up as well, 50-100%, despite the crowding in that band in general and where I live specifically.  I know link speeds are not the same as throughput, BUT, throughput is some *fraction* of link speed, so, if you don't get the higher link speed, you are limiting throughput as well, and now, I can work with the maximum *potential* speed that 802.11N currently provides.  Have not done formal speed/throughput benchmarking, but will update this review if I do.  Real world speed FEELS fast, and much faster than previous setup.Second, these adapters are really small!  No, they are not a USB dongle in size, but I want speed first and foremost for this application, and the device just needs some physical size for antennas to send and receive at these new higher 802.11N speeds.Setup was drop dead easy, just downloaded the latest driver and utility bundle from the TRENDnet site (I almost never use included CDs with devices, as the drivers are almost always out of date), installed, plugged in, and connected to my router with WPA2-PSK security (this specific security protocol is necessary to get to the top speeds in the 802.11N spec).Another cool thing I am testing is on my laptop, where I have both the built-in dual band 300 Mbps Intel radio and now the TRENDnet both operating simultaneously.  Have not done any benchmarks yet that would measure the benefits of such a setup, but I'm intrigued.  And it's just plain cool to have 2.4 and 5 GHz connections show up simultaneously in Windows wifi taskbar app.Summing up...Pros+ True 450 Mbps link speeds on 5GHz band in real world (router two rooms away thru three walls)+ Very small size - 3"" tall by 2"" wide+ Can locate device for optimum reception via USB cable+ GREAT price+ Easy setup, can be managed by Windows or through optional utility software+ Looks like a high tech shark fin :-)Cons- Throughput drops under load, as noted by others elsewhere (- 1 star).- Utility software is kind of primitive, but seems to work fine.  I did notice at one point that I had to enter my SSID password in both the TRENDnet utility and Windows Wireless Networking for things to work right, but kinda serves me right for leaving both enabled - heh hehTips* Location/orientation.  Move the adapter around, changing orientation, height, location, to get the best signal, and watch the link speed change to see which location provides best link speed.  I just held the adapter in many different positions for a few seconds and eyeballed the average link speed to find out what was best.  Turned out location/orientation within the range of the bundled USB cable could affect speed by  as much as 50%!  For me, higher was better (perhaps obviously), and the best orientation was sideways hanging off the edge of my 26"" LCD, with the lights facing down.  Hmmm... but it works.* Tune your router.  The router is of course the other key enabler of overall network performance.  Each router is different, but on the Asus Dark Knight I'm using the already mentioned WPA2-PSK security on both bands, 40MHz channel width on 5GHz band, and 20/40 Auto on the 2.4 GHz band, and, critically, power output turned up to the 200 mW maximum.  The latter REALLY helps both bands, but especially the 5GHz link speeds.Highly recommend the 684UB for those who have dual band 450 Mbps routers and need a high performance, reasonably priced adapter to match.

B00829TIEK,electronics,What do you think about capacity?,"The instructions that came with this drive say to go to this site:support.seagate.com/crossplatformto get the driver for Windows; I'm using Windows 7. That is not a valid site however. I had to search for the necessary software and found it here:[...]Once you get the Windows driver installed and are able to see the drive in Windows Explorer you will find that you have 2.72 TB that is actually usable on a 3TB drive. You will find video tutorials that show how to protect your files and how to use to drive when working with social media (like Facebook). I found the videos to be of very low quality. I could barely see what it was trying to demonstrate but they were somewhat useful if you choose to use their software.You will also get a free 1 year subscription to store you data on a cloud drive. I'd rather not keep my personal files on a cloud drive since I don't want my personal information stored on a server somewhere that could be accessed by others.Using their dashboard software it will automatically copy every non-system file (theoretically this will be your videos, music, and other files that you don't want to lose). I tried out their software and found that it works pretty well. It was easy to learn and use and this method of maintaining your data will appeal to a lot of people. Personally, I prefer not to use the software that came with this drive and have no desire to use it with social media. For that reason, I chose to simply format the drive after experimenting a bit with their software and now have a completely empty drive. It still says there is 2.72 TB available after formatting.According to the literature regarding USB3 is capable of transferring data at a rate of up to 5GB/second. However, when transferring appx. 500MB from the hard drive on my computer to this drive, I found that I had a transfer rate that varied between 30MB and 40MB/second. So, theoretically, transferring 500MB of data should take less than a second but it took about 10 minutes! I wonder if I'm missing something... My computer does have a USB3 port and I am using the USB3 cable that came with this drive. I don't think the slow speed is because of the main drive that is on my PC. Does anyone have an idea why this transfer speed is so slow; relatively speaking?That said, this drive seems to be reliable (after a weeks usage) and it is very quiet.

B00H3OYSHW,electronics,Where can I feel my device?,"I ordered my new NewTrend Airbender Pro NT610KR from Amazon.  I received it a few days later. It was great timing because I was just getting ready to leave on a business trip. I rapidly removed it from the box.  My initial impression was great. Starting from the cool box to the wireless keyboard case. The case looks great. It feels very sturdy and nice looking.  It is little thicker than my old case (another great case from NewTrend Airbend 2.0 (NT510K)).Next, I had to charge the case to use it. I had only a few hours left before I left. Now the charging process is a little strange.  The manual says that the light indicator should be lighted in RED, but I never saw it. I waited and eventually the light turned BLUE  (maybe the RED indicator only shows when the battery is dead. I will have to post an update once the first charge is over).Then came it came to placing my iPad Air into the new case. I struggled a little. The case is very tight. It is harder to take it apart.  Putting it together was very easy once I figured out how to take it apart. Each of the important input places are protected by a small tab which fits perfectly and makes the iPad well protected.  The case comes with a screen protector which is nice (I already have my screen protector), but I figured it will provide a double protection.  Now I had everything ready for my trip.When I boarded my flight, I was finally ready to use it.  First I needed to open the case to the position that felt most comfortable. There is a release button in the on the side of the case that releases the extension arm.  I pulled it too far and it came apart.  It was no problem. Pressed the button and placed the extension arm to the right level.  Now, I was truly ready to use it, but before I use it I had to pair the wireless keyboard and my iPad Air (updated to the last iOS).  First, I could not figure out how to turn on the keyboard. I did not read the manual, but I eventually figured that I need to hold the on/off button for a few seconds to turn it on and off. Then I pressed the pairing button which connected easily to my iPad.  Used extensively the keyboard during my 10 hours flight. I wrote emails and made notes in preparations for my upcoming client meetings. The keyboard felt nice. It was not clunky and was a good size.  With my first Airbender 2.0, I had some problems with the keyboard freezing my iPad which this worked perfectly.  During my trip, the passenger next to me commented about the case too. He said it looks really nice.During the week and my flight back, the case was still working perfectly. So far, no problems. I took some pictures with iPhone 5s. These may not be the greatest pictures, but it will provide you with some sense of this great case. If you have iPad and wants it to be protected and a great wireless keyboard, you must consider the Newtrend Airbender Pro (NT610KR)!Durability~5  (so far, no issue to report)Functionality~5 (it has all of the options I would want)Quality~5  (so far it has been great and fun to use it)Protective Capability~5 (this is a fantastic case)Shipping of product~5  (the box is pretty cool too) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3144, 3158)"

B0097BEF1S,electronics,How is the device?,"This is mainly a review for previous fourth generation usersApple iPod touch 32 GB White (4th Generation) CURRENT MODELupgrading to the Fifth Generation iPod touchApple iPod touch 32GB White (5th Generation) NEWEST MODEL.Background: I bought my first iOS device in December 2011 (4th Gen. 32GB iPod touch - White). It was everything I wanted and needed. Anyways, I had watched the keynote in September 2012, thinking ""No matter what, I'm keeping my old iPod touch"". By the end of the presentation, I was drooling over the new one. So, I sold my 4th gen. and bought this one in December 2012. Best choice ever.Upgrades over Fourth Generation:Build: It is so sleek compared to the 4th gen. I love the feel, and the ""squarer"" sides make it easier to hold and press the volume and power buttons. It is slightly harder to rest in my hand (my pinky acts as the support), but I attribute that to not having a case. It will wobble the tiniest bit, but having the loop button pushed out when flat helps to stabilize it. Also, the loop strap gives me more control when using one hand (and that is still easy, if not better with my longer fingers).-----------------------------------Screen: The screen size on the 5th gen. is a huge difference from previous generations. A family member still has the 4th, and it amazes me how stocky it looks now. The new length is great, as I do not have to scroll as often, and I can see more of the screen when I am using both hands (and I have small hands). It is definitely more responsive, and no glitches like a previous reviewer stated. The home button is more responsive as well, so I have to learn not to press it so much. The colors are more true to life now, and the screen is not blue or yellow tinted, just normal. The black bars for non-iPod touch 5 (worded as iPhone 5 in the App Store) optimized apps remind me just how small the previous screen was. Most well-known apps are optimized.-----------------------------------Sound: The speaker is slightly louder than the 4th gen. I can officially retire my cereal bowls. However, I have found that having the speaker on the right is a bit of a disadvantage, because I tend to cover it in landscape (right-handed). No biggie. The new EarPods are amazing. They fit much better in my ears, so I can sleep without taking them out. The bass is greatly improved. I never knewRock With You (Single Version)had background bass!-----------------------------------Durability: The anodized aluminum is sturdier than the previous metal back of the 4th gen. The top corner of my iPod just ""slapped"" the side of a tile counter today, and I was very pleased to not find one nick, scratch, or dent. I have yet to see any scratches (I have the White/Silver), and the back is finger-print resistant for the most part. I managed to get some sticky candy cane residue on the screen and sides last week, but I was able to wipe it off with a cloth. Oh, and the loop is sturdy. I have not yet bought a case because of this, as it is super easy to slip on, and it actually helps me steady the iPod in my hand. I'll probably buy some more loops instead of a case. I hated ruining my 4th gen.'s look with a case, even if it was clear. The iPod can hang by the loop and not fall off, which is good in case I lose my grip. The loop is hard to pull off without loosening it (unlike a Wii Remote strap), and has soft fabric where it meets your arm, so I can tighten it without a loss of circulation.-----------------------------------Speed: So, I had to do a few speed tests with a spare 4th generation. The 5th gen. boots in about ten seconds from reset, the 4th gen. takes 20-30 seconds. I opened the App Store in 6 seconds on the 5th gen., while the 4th gen. took 9 seconds. The Camera app launched in 2 and 3 seconds, so hardly any difference there. Overall, the 5th gen. decreases wait time. I don't find myself tapping my fingers like I'm using a Windows PC. It's a click, then a 5 second wait for games, and a 1 second wait for other apps. Safari is also faster, and connects quickly. I find myself with hardly any startup time, which my 4th gen. could take 5-10 seconds. By the way, my iPod touch has YET to crash at all, not even on Safari (which was a leading crasher on my 4th gen.). Graphic-intensive games no longer freeze, and my iPod only warms slightly (the 4th gen. felt like fire).-----------------------------------Camera: This will be short. It's better, period. You get LED flash (Which is an outstanding flashlight with iHandy's app), HDR for enhancement, and less noise. The 4th gen. catches NOTHING at night, while I was able to take a VERY CLEAR semi-family photo with flash in a pitch black room. The video is smoother, and clearer, and the LED flashlight can be used in conjunction with the video camera. Great for nighttime missions.-----------------------------------Battery life: Please do not pay attention to the lemon reviews. I have great battery life. With no WiFi, I was able to get a whopping ten hours of video, photos, games, and etc. Now, my 4th gen. would have died three times over. The calibration of the battery stays accurate. My 4th gen. showed 40-50% after thirty minutes of gaming. The 5th gen. still showed 65-75%. Awesome in my book, as I like to game without being plugged up. These numbers are with Wifi connected. On weekdays, I get a full day (9 a.m.-10 p.m. | Safari, Stock apps, Plaintext) without needing to charge. Weekends are about five hours (Gaming, communication, videos).-----------------------------------Siri and Dictation: Once she learns your voice, Siri can take you far. She didn't really have problems with my accent (I have a moderate Southern accent, and people said Siri couldn't understand them), so the user feedback must be working. She did have problems with drop (thinking it was job), and check (thinking it was Chad), but those are probably the fault of my own tongue. Dictation actually seems to work better than Siri, and it is better than writing long texts (I'm very thorough). I also enjoy the decrease of ""manual labor"". Reminders, FaceTime calls, Messages, Searches, even opening apps are handled through Siri. I never thought the days of a handheld robot would come. ;)-----------------------------------Overall: This was a must-do upgrade for me. I was cross that my 4th gen. was already a year old, and after seeing iOS 6 on it, I knew it would have a slim chance of making it to iOS 7. So, I decided to get onto the 5th's cycle. That was the best choice for me. I was very glad to see so many improvements, and each one is worth it. If you have a lemon, please return and exchange it. Don't give up on this great device.=========================================================================================================Six Month Update (June 24th, 2013):-----------------------------------Speed: My fifth generation is still running as fast as ever, and does not show any signs of slowing down. There is hardly any boot time for apps, and even graphic-heavy apps play smoothly.Screen: The four-inch screen is just so much better for my fingers. I never accidentally press the top of the iPod when I wanted to touch the back button on apps. The screen is nice and bright, and I love the true-to-life colors. I only use a dry fabric (microfiber cloth, shirt, pillow, recliner arm) to wipe the screen. Never use water, or you'll rub off the oleophobic coating and the oils from your skin, which makes the screen easier to swipe and scroll. Also, the screen is very durable, so I can use my nails (they are very firm) to scrap off sticky whatnot, and not worry about leaving a scratch.Siri: After a few months hiatus, I decided to use Siri again. After taking off some contacts' information, I feel safe enough to use the service, and it works splendidly. I'm glad that I don't need to give her my info just to use it, as that's not my preference. I use her to text others when I'm busy and don't want to stop. Timers and reminders are good to use with her, because I have a million of them. Those are such a *pain* to make. . .Sturdiness: Keeping with the s-themed update, I have to talk about this iPod's sturdiness. Just good craftsmanship on Apple's part, seriously. In six months, I only have a side dent and a nick. The back is still nice and smooth, and I would rest it on any surface without a second thought. The loop is history (RIP), and this device is slippery without it. I bought a Belkin case a few months ago, and there has been no more damage to my device, so I'm happy all around.

I can't understand anyone's justification for going the iPad Mini route when you can have twice the quality and performance at 1/3rd the price.If you know you can get apps you need for Android, then just go with a tablet that isn't stamped with the ""Apple"" label. The only time I could't justify someone getting an iOS tablet is musicians, which have many apps for direct guitar plug-in, piano/keyboard and many other music-based effects that are hard to find (for now) on Android.Otherwise, there's no reason to waste your money on something that just has a company's logo on it as proof of ""quality"".

B009PK9S90,electronics,Is this camera slightly small?,"UPDATE ON FEB. 9, 2013BATTERY LIFE:  The battery of the Hero2 does last 2x longer than the battery life of the Hero3.  I confirmed this as I did some videoing during the blizzard.  I bought the Wasabi battery pack with charger and their 1200mAh batteries do out last the stock batteries of 1050mAh.  But it won't  add significant life and you cannot swap the battery out with the GoPro Battery BacPac.  So I recommend buying more batteries and having at least 1 battery BacPac.END OF UPDATEThis is a review of the GoPro Hero3 Black Edition.  I am not going to explain what 1080i/30fps mean or any other specifics.  You should already know that since you are looking at this camera.  This is not the forum for technical explanations of what 4.7 Cin means for example.With that said, when I received the Hero3 the first thing I did was fully charge it.  I then went to preform a firmware update.  This was not needed as my camera came up-to-date.  I am running Windows 7.  I have shot pictures and video with it and it lives up to its expectation.Battery Life:  The battery life is short.  More so with the wifi on and/or LCD attached.  (I also bought the battery bacpac and the LCD Touch Screen).  I believe the problem of battery life to be the battery itself.  I own a Hero2 also.  The Hero2 uses an 1100mAh.  The Hero3 uses a 1050mAh.  It doesn't seem like much but I think the -50mAh is what hurts the Hero3.  I also ordered extra batteries from Wasabi.  I believe that these batteries will help this issue as they are 1200mAh.  These have not arrived.  When they do I will post some test results.  I plan on testing all the batteries alone and in conjunction with the battery bacpac.Freezing up:  I have had both my Hero2 (with the new update) and Hero3 freeze on me.  This only happened 1x each and it was when I was trying to rush through the menus. Since then, I have not had any freezing up issues.The screen:  I see people complaining about the little black and grey screen.  It's fine.  You are not buying this camera for fancy screen.  If you want a fancy screen; buy something different or get the touch screen.  The touch screen does improve moving through the menus immensely.  This camera is small so that it can be used in extreme situations without being cumbersome. It's smaller size and weight reductions is incredible.  I hardly notice it when using the head strap.Why I gave this a 4 star rating .... The camera functions as it was promised.  I am a little disappointed that they went to a lesser battery.  Meaning from a 1100mAh to a 1050mAh.  I am also upset with the fact that for all products I have to print out the manuals.  when spending $400 ... I expect the manuals.  Lastly, no covers.  If you want covers for the camera itself and the housing, you have to purchase them separately.  with those few list inconveniences; it was enough for me to take away 1 star.Few last words: DO NOT BY THIS CAMERA FROM GOPRO ...

Don't get me wrong, I love this little camera. The AF is insanely fast and accurate and the image quality is great. Here is the list of pros and cons I could come up with.Pros:- Super fast AF. Around the same speed as my Nikon D7000 and probably more accurate. It almost never missed focus.- Lightweight and small. Other have said with the pancake lens it will fit in your pants pocket. They must have really big pockets. There's no way I can fit it with the pancake lens on into a jean pocket. A jacket pocket sure, but not my pants.- Weather sealing!- Touch screen. This is an awesome feature. I can give my wife the camera and tell her to tap the screen on someones face and it takes the picture perfectly in focus.- Lots of lenses to choose from.- Image quality is really good.- Low light noise is pretty amazing for a sensor this small. If you're showing pics on the web, ISO 1600 and 3200 look great and I don't hesitate to use either. ISO 25600 is a marketing trick, it looks like my son drew a water color painting, ISO 12800 isn't great either.- It's built like a tank- The electronic viewfinder is a really nice addition although it's not as nice as an optical viewfinder on any DSLR I've ever used.- Large high quality LCD on the back- Battery life is very good. I took around 300 shots over a three day period and it was still at 3/4 full battery.- The way they positioned the two command dials works perfectly. The thumb and pointer finger rest on both allowing easy access to changing settings.Neutral:- The menu system is neither great nor terrible it just takes some getting used to.- The Buttons are mushy feeling and very small. The camera is small so it's kind of what I expected.Cons:- The included external flash is really weird. It's this tiny little thing you have to carry around in a pouch and it's really awkward to attach it to the camera. They should have just moved the viewfinder over to the side and put a flash in the camera with a hotshoe on top. It's a direct flash and doesn't allow you to pull it back and bounce it. I probably won't use it much if at all.- It's bit hard to firmly hold if you have big hands. I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it if I hold it with 1 hand. The grip could be improved.- The metal strap connectors are in a weird place and you have to put them in between your fingers to grip the camera.- The price was a little hard for me to swallow. For what you get it's probably the right price but it's still a lot of money.- This camera does not give DSLR quality images. I can easily spot any pic from my D7000 over a pic from the Olympus. The images are fantastic, don't get my wrong. But the look of the pictures from the camera is a little flatter and less 3 dimensional than a DSLR. It's hard to explain but the bigger sensor in bigger cameras does make a difference in image quality.Final ThoughtsYes the image quality is fantastic but for me this camera does not replace my Nikon D7000. Pictures from my Nikon just look slightly more realistic and have more pop to them. I bought this camera because I hate lugging my DSLR around. It's big and bulky and I never take it hiking or fishing with me. I wanted something that had close to DSLR quality images but in a tiny package I could carry everywhere. I wanted fast and accurate AF and I wanted it to be easy enough for my wife to use. I also wanted interchangeable lenses. With the Olympus I got everything I asked for. No it's not a DSLR replacement like I had hoped it would be. I wouldn't shoot weddings with this camera. Both types of cameras have their place and this little Olympus has found the perfect place into my bag. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3860, 3874)"
B006ZP8UOW,electronics,What color is that?,"I set the camera up in my house so you can view the picture with my home network. there were a few minor issues, but that is to be expected. The picture is good and the control work good as well. You have to pay for the full app for you phone. I think that sucks. The problems started when I tried to set up the remote access through the web. You have to subscribe to a web host for a minimal charge in order to be able to view your camera remotely from the web. The instructions are very vague and the quality of the instruction video that is on the install CD is really poor. It looks like they took the picture with a toaster. You would think a camera company would have a pristine video. Well it has been two weeks and I have played with it a few time, but still no luck. I have two weeks to get this set up as I wanted it to check on my house when I go on a extended vacation. I just don't get why they have to make things so difficult. I am no dummy when it comes to computers and networking. If I do ever figure this thing out, I will probably buy one or two more to spread out in my house.Update 11/9/13: I called Foscam and they remoted on to my computer and set up the web browsing for me. Turns out that I had done everything right, it is just that you need to use a different network connection to view your camera over the web than the one the camera is on. They should state this loud and clear somewhere. Also, you do not need to sign up to a web host to get access. Foscam gives you a free connection. The remote app works great over WiFi or a wired connection, but is very sluggish and slow over a cell connection. I used this while we went on vacation for two weeks. You can set up alarms so when the camera detects sound or motion it will email you 6 pictures. Got worried one AM when it showed people in my house. Turns out it was the cleaning lady who got the dates mixed up. I was not able to figure out who was in the picture by sight, but when I put two and two together and figured out that was her normal day, I could see it was her. So, the picture could be better.

B00GP4BVTO,electronics,How about profile?,"The New Trent Airbender Air Clamshell Bluetooth keyboard case for the iPad Air is an improvement over  many of the older models for previous iPads. The keyboard continues to be easy to use even in big hands. One complaint I had with my old keyboard was a lack of cut, copy paste functions. Well now I have them and they work well for my purposes. Also included are function keys for brightness, volume, music/video play options, and home screen or locking the screen. They all work well and make navigating easier.The case itself has a nice look and feel to it. The case doesn't feel cheap or too plasticky. As the name suggests its a clamshell design, that remains as one unit, with a swivel arm that allows for you to display the iPad in either landscape or portrait positions. The arm has a nice strong feel to it, since it is made of metal rather than plastic. The arm could use a lock that keeps the iPad at the user's perfect pitch, but the pitch at the fully extended position feels fine to me.Easy bluetooth connection, and great battery life make this a great keyboard. I have had for about 10 days now and have yet to plug in for my first charge. One feature I am happy to see is the bottom of the case doesn't prohibit you from being able to utilize the lightning adapter for old 30 pin products. I happen to have one of these and use it for charging while traveling.Overall I like this keyboard, but I have had the opportunity to also use New Trent Airbender 2.0 for the iPad air as well. While I do like the look and feel of this version, I am much happier using the Airbender 2.0 due to the ability to detach the back of the case from the keyboard itself. If you are someone who mostly uses their iPad with a bluetooth keyboard often, this may be the way to go, otherwise if you are like me and want a functional keyboard at times, with the ability to leave it at home and still have a case for your iPad, think about the Airbender 2.0.

And I need two thumb buttons.  I can't live without my shortcuts.I've been using the VX Revolution for a few years.  Even though advertised as a 'laptop mouse', I found it fit my hand better than the desktop version.  But they never lasted - the left click would last a year or two, and I'd have to replace the mouse.  This time the VX Revolution was discounted so I had to search for a replacement.  The M705 turnout to be like the VX Revolution refreshed....I've been using the M705 for about two months now and I'm a happy camper.  The mouse has a great shape and fits in my right hand very well .  top buttons are comfortable and snappy.  And the thumb buttons are in a great location - not in my way so I keep clicking them, but no so far away I have to stretch the thumb.  The left and right surfaces have a gripping surface, but your fingers won't stick to them.The M705 has two more features I've gotten used two.  There's a third 'hidden' thumb button.  When you press the thumb down it can trigger another function (I have it set to Expos&eacute;).  The scroll wheel also has a handy button next to it.  Usual wheel response is your standard 'notched' feeling (click-click-click as you scroll).  There's a small button out-of-the-way behind the scroll wheel that will switch between 'click' mode and smooth mode.  In smooth mode the wheel will spin freely.  And it's very free - it'll spin for a good 15-20 seconds on the new mouse.  if I have a huge browser window to scroll through, smooth-mode is great!  I don't know how I would live without it.The mouse comes with the 'standard' Logitec control center software, which is working just fine on MacOS 10.6.  Actually, I didn't have to install any software - I had it installed for the VX Revolution - so the Control Center automatically recognized the new mouse with no problems.Not many downsides.  This mouse takes two AA batteries rather than just one - not sure why that is.  There is an on/off switch on the bottom if you want to save batter life.  And, like every mouse I've ever owned, the feet pick up a lot of dust and such from the desk.  No worse than any other mouse.  I'll have to wait a year or two to see if this lasts longer than the VX mouse.  And, of course, never happy paying $50 for a mouse..So happy camper here.

B00452V66G,electronics,What do you think about the camera?,"For the price, this S-Link camera seems to be a great value. It does not promise to be a whole-house security system with real time recording, etc. If you want that, look elsewhere and expect to pay more.But what you do get is a very good camera with high quality imaging that can be set up quickly and accessed by an easy to use app.I installed this camera in a matter of minutes on my home system (Mac based). The installer really was a breeze. The free iPhone app also installed quickly and in less than 10 minutes after opening the box I was monitoring my kitchen and living room on my iPhone.Daytime-mode images are nice and crisp, and the night-time images are also very good and seem to have a range well beyond the 15 feet D-Link indicates (perhaps I have more ambient light in my area at night). You can also connect the camera by cable or wifi, but wifi seems to be by far the best choice as then you have much more flexibility as to where to place the camera.Other reviewers have complained that without a recording feature the camera isn't very useful, as you would have to be watching the feed all the time to see if anyone was breaking in, messing with your stuff, etc. However we have a good home alarm system and if it ever went off we would be notified immediately, which would allow me to turn on the app and check the camera right away. The app also includes a photo option, so you can take still photos from the D-Link camera that are saved to your Photos app (on the iPhone/iPad anyway).Two minor issues were 1) the iPhone app sometimes doesn't connect to the camera, and needs to be restarted to get the feed; 2) there is a 2-3 second delay in the feed, so it is almost but not quite ""real time"" (this may be a function of network speed, cell-phone distance, etc.). And of course, should your network go down, the camera is useless. But that almost goes without saying.For the price, this is a good-quality camera. It requires manual monitoring but unless you are willing to pay much more for a hard-drive based surveillance system, in this price range the D-Link camera is a very good option.

B0088CJT4U,electronics,How is design?,"Every now and then you come across a product that brings a smile to your face and this could turn out to be one of them. I know I will not be in a position to take full advantage of this router's features for a while because most of my devices lack 5GHz capability but in spite of that there is  no doubt it will help overall network performance. While it appears to be positioned at the modest end of the manufacturer's dual band router product line, there is nothing modest about its' usefulness.Using the resource mini-cd for the setup assistant application, basic installation was completed in less than ten minutes, not factoring in the number of individual devices I needed to reconfigure to identify the new SSID(s) and password(s).  In order to create guest networking, a firmware update from the TP-LINK's website has to be installed. It should be noted the downloaded files must be extracted using WinZip or WinRAR, which might encumber some casual users. If the intention is to continue to use the Assistant app, there also appears to be another firmware update required to coincide with the other the other firmware modifications, as I discovered when I lost connectivity and couldn't restore it via the CD copy.  I didn't download it as I have enough familiarity with router configuration that I had already decided to log onto the administrative page and make manual changes before I realized there was a fix available.With theoretical transfer rates up to 300Mbps over both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands which results in the published combined rate of 600Mbps,  the router has already proven to be a nice step forward for my home/ home office network even though most of my activity will remain on the lower bandwidth at `g' standard. With two detachable external antennas, I would rate overall signal strength as good but not outstanding over 2.4GHZ. On the alternate band, degradation to some problematic areas in my house was evident (and expected) yet tolerable without with use of a range extender or access point.On a laptop where I swapped the existing adapter for a dual band `n' standard adapter I experienced an immediate consistent increase from the customary 36 to 46Mbps I was used to to 84Mbps via 5GHZ. That will be beneficial for streaming music and video files and networked backups to and from my media server and NAS. I'm sure most users will also be aware the 5GHZ band will only be visible on devices with dual band adapter capability and network names have to be segregated. As expected, WAN transferal over either band was not improved significantly as ISP limitations come into play there although there did appear to be a slight improvement as interference from other networks in my area is minimal on the 5GHz band.Naturally, some of us want caviar at catfish prices so it would have been great if the router had gigabit ethernet ports but it does have a USB port for networking printers and storage devices , freeing up another ethernet port for another device. It also has a power switch, a convenience absent on many devices in this price range, and  wireless on/off switch which is convenient for disabling broadcasts when one is away but needs to leave the network running for some processes like scheduled backups to a networked storage device.One interesting thing was I swapped out my normal adapters for the TP-LINK WDN 3200 thinking paired products from the same manufacturer might marginally improve performance but it turned out the opposite was true. On a laptop and older desktop PC, signal strength was actually lessened by 20% I tend to believe that may be attributable to the adapters lack of external antenna. I did not try the USB type adapter with an external cord which could have impacted results by facilitating different angles. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3790, 3804)"

B0053DDNW6,electronics,Is a good quality of memory ?,"I bought this from Amazing Tech Depot. It's one of the few times I received something like this in a ziploc bag (with the DVR in a bubble wrap). Construction is cheap, and although the instructions described an A/V cable, there isn't one in the package. I wasn't planning on connecting this directly to a TV, so I didn't follow up on that.What's included is the DVR, the lithium ion battery, the suction cup mount, a piece of instruction leaflet (English, Chinese and Russian), the car power adapter (very long cord - can be routed to keep it out of the way) and a mini USB cable. You need to open one of the flaps on the side to plug in the USB power cable. The other flap on the opposite side covers the SD card slot.The screen is protected by a sheet of plastic. Removing it was a pain, but take your time so that you don't damage the LCD. The LCD is useful for helping aim the camera, and for settings, but unusable in bright sunlight even inside the car. I went through the menu settings. They're pretty much self explanatory, which is good because the instruction leaflet was no help. You need to supply a full sized SD card. I used a 32 GB card without any problem.There is a 1920x1080 setting for video. When I chose that, it recorded in 1280x720 (NOT 1080p), but at slightly above 30 fps. At the 1280x720 setting, it recorded at just slightly above 29.97 fps.Encoding format is motion JPEG. Video quality is mediocre. Don't count on being able to read license plates, but you can definitely tell what you're seeing. IR, as most people pointed out, is useless, and you can leave it off.Using it is simple. Leave it plugged in. When the car turns on, it powers up the unit which starts recording. When you turn the car off, the unit records for another few seconds, then powers off. Files are 2 mins in length, configurable for longer lengths. Default is to erase older files when the card is full.At just a bit over $20, it's a good DVR to play around with. Probably good enough for insurance purposes, though I'm not sure if it can be used as evidence in court. My guess is that it would probably be good enough to prove your innocence (or at least cast reasonable doubt), but not enough to get someone else convicted.

Even though I wasn't actively looking for a keyboard, it met two requirements I had for an HTPC keyboard to replace the existing one.1 - The mouse is not targeted to right handers.  As a left hander, I am continually frustrated by Mice that are unusable for me.2 - Range - I had been using a MS Laser 5000 keyboard and mouse on the HTPC.  The range was so limited that one had to sneak up on the computer to get things to work.  The advertised range for the Wireless Desktop 3000 was 30 feet.  That caught my attention so I purchased one and sure enough if works fine from across the room.  That in itself makes the purchase worthwhile.They also advertise that the mouse works on any surface and it seems to.  I can sit on the sofa and use the mouse on the arm of the sofa with no problems.  However, the 5000 mouse is equally responsive on any surface, it just doesn't have the range.Unfortunately, the keyboard design has changed from the Wireless 5000.  The key layout has changed enough that I wouldn't want to have to switch between the 3000 and 5000 for normal use (both of my desktops use the 5000) but for the HTPC where we don't do a lot of typing the new keyboard is fine.The ESC, function, PrtScrn, ScrLock, and Pause keys have been miniaturized as have all of the dedicated function keys.  The keys are also aligned straight across the keyboard as opposed to the curved design of the 5000.  One would thing that the ergonomics of keyboards would be pretty well understood by now but we keep changing them with every new iteration.From my perspective, if you like your current keyboard and mouse there is no reason to make an impulse purchase (I bought mine at Sam's on impulse mainly for the range).

You would think a camera company would have a pristine video. Well it has been two weeks and I have played with it a few time, but still no luck. I have two weeks to get this set up as I wanted it to check on my house when I go on a extended vacation. I just don't get why they have to make things so difficult. I am no dummy when it comes to computers and networking. If I do ever figure this thing out, I will probably buy one or two more to spread out in my house.Update 11/9/13: I called Foscam and they remoted on to my computer and set up the web browsing for me. Turns out that I had done everything right, it is just that you need to use a different network connection to view your camera over the web than the one the camera is on. They should state this loud and clear somewhere. Also, you do not need to sign up to a web host to get access. Foscam gives you a free connection. The remote app works great over WiFi or a wired connection, but is very sluggish and slow over a cell connection. I used this while we went on vacation for two weeks. You can set up alarms so when the camera detects sound or motion it will email you 6 pictures. Got worried one AM when it showed people in my house. Turns out it was the cleaning lady who got the dates mixed up. I was not able to figure out who was in the picture by sight, but when I put two and two together and figured out that was her normal day, I could see it was her. So, the picture could be better. I ordered a new one today for the bedroom. It is supposed to have a sharper picture, I will let you know. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2199, 2213)"

B00119T6NQ,electronics,Is this device compatible?,"For $200.00, the least you would expect are rubber type buttons with a nice tactile feel, the high quality type that you find on Tivo's top of the line remote and Sony's remote. Instead, the buttons are made of cheap plastic and have the feel of a a $29.00 organizer you might buy at Walgreens. The keys on the remote and the remote itself are slippery and the ergonomics of holding the remote appear to fit the hands of a species not of this earth. It is much easier to press the buttons on my Sony or Tivo.Its also very easy to press the wrong item on the LCD as the choices on the LCD are very close together.The main thing this unit is good for (when it works) is turning multiple components on or off in sequence. Because the remote is clumsy to manipulate, turning the components all one as programmed often doesn't work. There isn't much tolerance for not aiming it at the sweet spot of your components which you have to determine by trial and error.The macros are nice, but the unit is slower than the native remote, ie the Tivo so it somewhat offsets using the macros. Once I turn on my components I now just start using the Tivo remote until I am ready to turn all my components off.Essentially, for me this is a $200.00 device to turn my components on or off.

B00DVFLJDS,electronics,How about the specs?,"**REVIEW UPDATED ON 7/30/13 - Updated speakers, ""other features"", battery life, gripes**For anyone on the fence, and especially for those frustrated by the performance slowdown issues with the original Nexus 7 tablet, don't let that scare you off from buying the second generation model.Google made all of the right improvements to the product, and the result is a significantly improved product for a marginally higher cost. Only time will tell if this unit suffers the same performance fate as the original model (for those not familiar, over time, the first generation tablets tended to quickly slow down and struggle to perform even basic tasks like browsing the internet). However, Android 4.3 feels ultra-smooth so far, and I am hoping that Google and Asus learned from their original mistakes.SCREEN: The new screen is absolutely stunning. Some people argue that the resolution of 323 pixels per inch is unnecessary, but you can really see the difference when you use it in person. Text is significantly sharper and a little easier on the eye to read. Using the tablet to watch videos and see pictures produces a stunning result.PROCESSOR: This is the #1 reason I'd recommend this new, upgraded Nexus 7 over the older version. The speed upgrade is unquestionably immense, and to those who have used the older and newest model Nexus 7, you will notice and appreciate this immediately. Apps load instantly; the internet browsing experience is smooth and a very welcome upgrade over past performance. It's strange; a few days ago I was satisfied with the decent albeit declining performance of my 1st Gen Nexus 7. Now that I have this new one, I use them both side by side and the older model feels like a dinosaur. This alone is reason enough to upgrade.SIZE/WEIGHT: The reduced thickness and weight of the tablet is very noticeable. I often times used my old Nexus 7 tablet while sitting in bed, to check email and browse the web prior to going to sleep. Holding the old Nexus in one hand, and the new one in the other, the differences in size and weight are VERY noticeable. No doubt will provide a more comfortable long term usage experience, especially for extended sessions while on flights or the subway.BATTERY LIFE: After a couple days of using this new Nexus 7, I can confidently say that the battery life has been significantly improved over the original model. My previous session of about 2 hours straight of use (screen on, using apps that draw semi-frequent data over wi-fi) drained only 20% of the battery life. If I project this out, it would tell me that I could get 10 hours of constant use on one full charge. I haven't run through an entire charge yet from 100% down to 0% (I've been recharging after each use), but I'll try to get to that sometime this week and report back on my total real-world battery life.CAMERAS: Google added a rear-facing Camera on this new second gen Nexus. While I typically wouldn't use my tablet as a camera, I have tried it out and it takes excellent pictures. Focuses quickly, the images are sharp and the low light performance, while not great, is better than I would have expected. The front-facing camera gets more use for me (I use my tablets to Skype with family). The new front facing camera is noticeably sharper and better in lower light situations than the original Nexus 7 camera was. In low light, the old model was almost unusable. The 2nd gen Nexus 7 low light performance is very acceptable.SPEAKERS: I've now spent some time using this second-gen Nexus 7 side by side with my original Nexus 7. Separately, they both sound very acceptable for speakers from small tablets. Using them side by side, the improvements to the Nexus 7 are very noticeable, and the sound is more clear even at high volumes. I'd say that this new model sounds far less ""tinny"" than the original Nexus did. Personally, I don't use the built-in speakers often (I'm normally either listening with headphones, or using bluetooth audio to my Logitech Boombox). But for people who do use the built-in speakers to play music or watch movies, you will appreciate the improvement in the speakers.OTHER FEATURES: Last night, I realized that this tablet is compatible with Qi Wireless Charging, a discovery which made me VERY happy. I use a Nexus 4 cell phone, and I keep it on my nightstand on the Google Nexus Charging Orb. I attempted to use the orb with this new Nexus 7 tablet, and it worked perfectly. You have to sit the tablet landscape, with the orb centered on the tablet, and it synced up and began charging instantly.COMPARISONS: I will update this section shortly with my comparison review between this 2nd Gen Nexus 7, the iPad Mini, and the Kindle Fire HD, as soon as I've had more time to test them all side by side.GRIPES AND COMPLAINTS: Here, I'll list any gripes that I have about the tablet. My first major gripe is that I am not a huge fan of the texture/material used on the back of the tablet. It's a slightly rubberized feeling coating, which I assume they did to create additional grip. However, I've been finding that after holding with one hand for a few minutes, I notice the tablet starting to slide a little bit in my hand. I think this is a combination of the new texture plus the fact that it's thinner than it used to be. I'm probably going to be purchasing a case for it shortly, which should alleviate this problem, but it is still worth noting. This is just a personal preference things (if you normally hold it landscape w/ two hands, you'll probably prefer this new texture over the old one).All in all, I am VERY impressed with how much faster this tablet is than my original Nexus 7 tablet. As long as this model doesn't suffer the performance slowdown issue of the original Nexus 7, I don't anticipate moving this away from a 5 star product anytime soon, but only time will tell I guess. I will keep this review updated as I go, and add thoughts on more features once I test them out further (the speakers, longer term battery life tests, performance slowdown, etc). If you have anything else you want me to address, please let me know in the comments section and I will be glad to address it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6169, 6183)"
B007I5JT4S,electronics,Does the rino models have great interface?,"After trying both versions of the apple tv 2 and 3. I can say if you don't really need 1080p then there's really no need to get the newer version. Only a few sources at this point are 1080p. The iTunes store is the main source where you will greatly benefit from the 1080p. There are quite a few tv shows and movies in 1080p in the iTunes store to rent or buy. If your buying this device for 1080p on Netflix then there still aren't that many movies or tv shows. Also it's very hard to find which ones are 1080p.  Unlike the iTunes store which has icons for HD which means 720p and other icons for 1080p. The Netflix app only has icons for standard definition and HD. From my experience Netflix streaming had very bad picture quality.  The picture seemed to be artifacted and pixelated even with HD content. I had no issues with same content on my apple tv 2 or any of my other netlix devices on my 32mbps connection. I'm guessing that my apple tv 3 was defective as I haven't heard complaints of my issues. There are many threads on macrumor forums and apple discussions forums about the same issue. From my experience the picture quality was only bad on Netflix. Regardless of my issues I still feel the apple tv 3 is not up to par with other streaming devices.  Just about any streaming device (gaming consoles, blu ray players and media boxes) offer many more options in terms of services). In addition alot of them are cheaper or at the same price of the apple tv3. The newer apple tv does has have a faster processor and more RAM than the previous version. The only way to get apps and more streaming services on your apple tv 3 is to use air play with either an iPad , iPhone or iPod touch. At this point there is no jailbreak available on the apple tv 3. I didn't notice a difference in performance on the newer apple tv 3. Also I personally didn't notice a difference in picture quality between my apple tv 2 and 3. If you already have an apple tv 2 then I don't think you need to upgrade to the newer one. Also if you are considering an apple tv at this time and don't have tv that is 46 inches or larger I would strongly recommend looking at getting a refurbished apple tv 2 for $69 directly from appple. I decided the return my apple tv 3 and just get the refurbished older model. It's cheaper, easier to jailbreak and still has the great features and interface.I still find the aplle tv 3 overpriced when compared to other streaming devices that it competes with. But for the air play functionality alone it makes a great accessory for the iPad , iPhone and iPod touch. Also the netlix interface is far suporior to any other device I've tried.

The entire Keyboard can be separated from the iPad half of the case which is perfect for users that desire a little more distance between the two. The iPad can be used independent of the keyboard while still retaining half the case to protect the bottom and sides. It uses a pinch lock mechanism to quickly unsnap it.

B00834SJNA,electronics,How is the usb?,"We expect our computers to do a lot.  They store our files, they help us to communicate, we use them in our work, and much more.  Our computers have become an essential part of our lives, as necessary as a car or a microwave.  In some cases, a computer may be more important than some of the things we previously considered key devices in our life.As our expectations of our computers has grown, so too have our expectations regarding memory.  Just a short time ago, we thought 100's of megabytes (or even megabytes) was a lot of memory, only to find that even a terabyte could be filled with memories and entertainments.  Expansion drives provide a relatively cost effective way of adding storage to a computer, particularly if the computer is doing everything you need it to do with respect to processing power.This particular expansion drive seems to be a cost-effective way to add a lot of memory to a computer.  This drive is compatible with USB 3.0 and includes a USB 3.0 cable.  The transfer speed of USB 3.0 is about ten times faster than the previous, widespread standard, USB 2.0.  The faster speed means that, if you have a USB 3.0 interface on your computer, this expansion drive will appear to operate nearly as fast as your internal drive with respect to transferring files, except for very large files.  As one example, we loaded a movie (not high resolution) onto this drive and played the movie flawlessly from the drive.  The only flaw with the transfer speed is that it says nothing about the speed of the hard drive itself, which I was unable to figure out.  For the kinds of files I typically save, it was sufficiently fast.This drive is plug and play.  Connect the drive to your computer, and seconds later, it shows up as a drive on your directory.  The drive operates just like any other folder on your drive.  You may readily move files into and out from the drive, or launch files directly from the drive.  You should eject or shut down the drive before disconnecting it from your computer.While this drive seems to have a lot going for it, there are a couple of potential issues or annoyances, and one possible concern.This drive lays flat.  I have one other Seagate 2 TB external drive that stands up vertically.  I prefer the vertical arrangement because it takes up less space on the desk where I typically use the hard drive.  I have accidentally pulled the vertical hard drive over because I forgot to disconnect the cable, which is clearly not an issue with this hard drive, though that particular issue has not happened to me recently with my vertical external drive.Another possible problem is that this drive gets warm if it is used for very long.  One reason this could be an issue is the location where the drive is used.  Many people are heading to the desert in support of various U.S. initiatives and taking an expansion drive with them.  Since air conditioning is not ubiquitous in many of these locations, overheating is a potentially significant concern.Yet another incipient issue is decreased life.  I have seen some concerns regarding this particular drive and a shortened life, but the reports seem to be preliminary and may be isolated failures.  I think there is insufficient data at this point to be a cause for alarm, but neither am I sufficiently comfortable with the reliability of this drive to recommend it without a least a bit of reservation.  I suggest monitoring reviews on Amazon or doing some additional research to see whether these drives suffer from a shortened life.One thing I find troubling is the location of vent holes in the case.  I am a big fan of venting for electronics that have the potential to get warm.  This drive has vent holes on the bottom and on the back, but that does not necessarily optimize flow of air through the drive.  While the position of these holes prevents spilled fluids from readily entering the drive, the position of the holes is less than optimum from an airflow perspective, which may be part of the reason this drive seems to get warm.I now have several external drives.  I think the primary reason is my paranoia that highly valuable files will be lost because of some unforeseen and catastrophic circumstance.  I can replace my computer reasonably quickly, but I cannot replace the files on the computer.  Thus, I have an external hard drive set up for automatic backup, another hard drive available for transporting files, and a hard drive backup to the primary backup.  Yes, I have many duplicate files, but at least I minimize the risk that the files will be lost permanently.  The particular hard drive appears to be cost-effective and small.  I am a little concerned about the life of the drive, but it will take me time to learn whether that is an issue.  Until then, this drive is now an important part of my life.Enjoy!

It was a mixture of video, audio and text files roughly 5GB in size.The computers on both ends are Gig capable BTW.  This transfer went smooth and fast.

B004OOTRPC,electronics,Do you have a limited choice?,"The GoodI ordered the 55"" model from Amazon. It was delivered 4 days earlier than expected. As always, you can't go wrong by shopping at Amazon. When I first unpacked LG Infinia LW5600, I was so pleased at the aesthetics. I hadn't actually seen one in person and was amazed at how sleek looking the front was, and how incredibly thin this television is. It's amazingly about 1"" thick. It has a nice swivel base, which I love. At this point I wasn't going to mount it on the wall, but given it's incredibly thin profile, I would some day; it would look awesome on a wall. It was easy to mount on the base, and the television is light enough, a strong enough person could do it without help. I didn't have any problem. I turned it on went through the easy to follow initial setup. Easy Easy Easy to set up, and connect to a home network via WIFI.This set has more bells and whistles than you'll ever need, some being really cool. It has the standard stuff like Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, and even Facebook. It also has a web browser that allows you to brows the web just like you would on your computer. Pretty cool on a 55"" HD screen. The web browser even has some nice tools such as Favorites. There are Apps, just like you would find on a smart phone; some free and some for purchase. The ""magic wand"" remote is pretty cool, with it's Wii like function of just point at the TV, move the cursor over an item, and click. In other words, when you hear the term ""feature rich"" this TV certainly is.The passive 3D is pretty cool, although I don't have a 3D blue ray movie in my collection yet. The 2D to 3D conversion is surprisingly pretty cool and pretty well done. With the conversion feature, you won't get things popping out of the screen, but it does add depth to the picture, sort of like watching real life through a 55"" window. The glasses are very comfortable, to the point I forgot I had them on. You can walk around the house with them on and they do not hinder your vision. However, I did notice, with the passive 3D, you can't get to far off center from the picture because you'll get a lot of crosstalk. I did view some true 3D content in the apps section, which did have things popping right out of the screen. I was impressed with the 3D.The BadFirst let me say, I'm crushed this TV didn't live up to what is could be. I wanted to keep it so badly, mostly because if it's awesome features, and the sleek look. Then I started actually watching television. It was all uphill from there. Let's just point out the very poor sound quality form the speakers. I expected that. You can't expect theatre sound from a TV that's an inch thick, or any other flat screen TV for that matter. I also noticed, very distinctly, what some are calling the ""Soap Opera Effect"". It makes the picture, no matter what the source, BluRay, Cable, Netflix, etc... look like it was filmed on a home video camera. It's very odd and hard to explain, but it's like watching a low budget public access show that can't afford the really expensive professional video cameras and lighting they use to make Hollywood movies. Grab your video camera, go out in your back yard, and film your family, then watch it on your TV. That's what all programming looks like on the TV; even Avatar looked like it was filmed informally with a cheap camera, even though in HD. To be honest, at times, it was pretty interesting to see things in that perspective, but mostly it gets annoying because you never see anything as it was intended by the director. In other words, it's a huge drawback, but not the biggest.The biggest drawback is the different aspects of the horrible picture quality. First, let me explain, this ain't my first rodeo. I've owned plasma and LCD TVs, ranging from 40"" to 50"". So setting up a good picture is something I'm quite familiar with. I spent three days tweaking the settings in this TV, trying to get the colors, brightness, etc... where I like it. It seemed to get one thing right, I had to sacrifice another. Finally I just settled by saying it's not the best, but I could probably live with it, although it still ticked me off. Of the poor picture quality issues, this wasn't the worst. The worst and complete deal breaker was the incredible amount of motion blur and shuttering you get from this set. It's horribly intolerable, even to the point of causing horrible eye strain. This is in regular 2D mode, mind you. The ""True Motion"" feature is useless. In fact even LG Support suggests you turn it off. After the first couple of days of trying to get rid of the juddering effect, I called LG customer support and got a tech on the line. He said I'd have to switch the AV mode to GAME mode. This helped some, but only some. The motion blur and juddering were still intolerable, and what you gained by using GAME mode, you lost by adding a ghosting effect around any moving objects on the screen. The LG tech said, and I quote, ""if that didn't fix it, that's just how the picture is then."" Anyway, what's the point of having different ""Modes"" if you can only use GAME Mode? Didn't matter anyway, it still didn't solve the problem.In the end, the TV is sitting in my guest bedroom now, all packed up, and waiting for the shipping company to pick it back up to return it to Amazon. I went to Walmart yesterday and purchased a 60"" Panasonic 2D Plasma they have on sale for $898 This set was awesome right out of the box as soon as I turned it on. I spent less than 10 minutes tweaking the picture settings and I'm done. It's awesome every time now. I really wanted to love the LG set, but unfortunately there's no getting around the fact that you purchase a television to enjoy watching it, and this set did nothing but frustrate and annoy me. I wouldn't recommend it. You still can't beat a plasma TV for picture quality. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5819, 5833)"

B005CLPP84,electronics,What is remote control?,"I purchased a regular roku hd early spring and absolutely loved it.  Got rid of my 85.00 mo. satellite bill and subscribed to netflix and playon for 15.00 a month, both of which have a ton of hidden channels so I get all the shows except one I always watched, and I can watch it online.  My hubby got an LG hdtv with apps and we were impressed.  After I read about roku, I purchased a LG hdtv without apps and hooked a roku to it and its superior to the one with apps now.  Netflix especially works better with roku.  After 3 mos. my hubby decided he wanted a roku since I was getting way more programming. Upon checking out roku I found the roku 2 available and we ordered the xs model with the Angry Birds on it.  It is a bit smaller than the original roku, has a place for a micro-mini sd card expanding the memory so you can add more roku channels then usual.  I really liked that!  The setup was great, it updated immediately and wirelessly with no problem 2 rooms away from my router.  I bought an ethernet cable in case the update wirelessly hit a snag, as it did on the LG, but didn't need it.  PLug in the electric cord, hook the hdmi cable to the tv and roku, turn it on and let it update and follow on screen instructions.  Simple!  I was surprised that  I could add all the same channels on his roku as on mine without having to activate the channels.  I knew netflix allowed 6 tvs in the same home on one account, but didnt know roku would let you add another roku without all the hassel of activations.  The only channel I had to activate separately was epix.  It is a 14 day free trial deal, so each account must be on a separate email account and each device activated separately.  I did activate netflix on the roku because the movie images are much larger then on his hdtv and his eyesight isnt the best.  It makes it a lot easier for him to select a movie.  This roku lets you use the ethernet cable or wireless.  It has the Angry Birds which loads after update.  My only complaint is that I cannot get round one of the Birds to work.  It loads and starts but I can't get any action.  Im not familiar with this game so will have to do some research on this.  The remote is better on the roku 2.  Its rounded instead of square, the arrow keys are more defined, it has a separate ok button.  It has 2 extra buttons, A and B to use when playing the game.  The instruction booklet is very poor concerning the birds.  No instruction on how to play the game or what those two buttons do.  The remote is similar to a wii, you wave it and the cursor moves to where you want it.  I may not have gotten a good install of the game so I will remove it and reinstall and see if that works.  This is a much improved device for 99.00.  Locally, the old rokus are being sold for the same prices, no discount.  May as well buy the new improved for 99.00 as an older model without the improvements for the same price.  This is an excellent gift, especially for anyone trying to save money in the bad times.  I can't see how anyone would not at least cutback on cable/satellite if not disconnecting altogether. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3111, 3125)"
B0074BW614,electronics,How big is the unit?,"I am *so* glad I traded a (refurbished) 8.9"" in for a (new) 7""!! The refurbished unit was like new btw. But having grown accustomed to my previous 7"" 1st gen Fire, this is just right. There are also minute differences on the keyboard, etc. between the sizes that I was already used to. I think the 8.9 is too big and heavy; and this one is just right :) Love Fire in general, and enjoying all the new functions, especially the audiobook/ebook synchronization, as well as the new standard text-to-speech voice which is certainly improved on the original. I am also for the first time typing on the bluetooth keyboard which paired perfectly once I figured it out and types amazingly comfortably (by Amazon), plus the original (leather) Amazon case (in blue); the difference in price between the sizes allowed me those extras (and a charger). Works great. Also there is a phone app so you can make and receive calls. 5-Star performance! :)Update:  I returned this unit for a refurbished non-HD (gen. 2) Fire. I just don't think the HD adds anything (the screen of my original Fire is perfectly responsive and visually; it doesn't have the slight pauses or glitches of the HD. I reasoned the 10-point touch screen & HD-quality ""video card"" (or whatever a Fire has) takes more RAM and software to operate, hence possibly accounting for the difference from my *perfect* 1st gen. unit. I watch Netflix and HD-quality YouTube videos on my 1st gen. and honestly don't see a difference. I also know the refurbished units are just as fine and functional as new ones. I got two more cases with the deal, one being a duplicate of my favorite which is hard ""fabric"" that completely zips around unit and has no ""straps"" (Marware beige)Marware jurni Kindle Fire Case Cover, Beige (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)Most of the new features like text ebook/ audiobook synchronization (immersion reading) are included in the new (2nd gen.) software and I'm hoping the new text-to-speech voice software is as well. They are not HD-dependent. Of course I am sacrificing Bluetooth functionality (keyboard, separate speakers), HDMI-out for a larger screen, and one App that allows you to use the device as a phone; probably the microphone is missing too, and of course the camera is (mine was too dark and grainy anyways, not nearly as good as a built-in laptop cam for example). So, no Skype on the non-HD if those features matter to you (the phone App was neat).My main beef was the screen, again in the HD 7"" Fire was yellow, with less contrast (for text ebooks) than my 1st gen. which I far preferred. Mostly I use my Fire for reading ebooks, and that was what was important to me. I keep my half-way brightness setting, and it's always sufficient. Secondly I browse websites and videos, and my 1st gen. is nimble & quick and perfectly capable. So I'm hoping the 2nd gen. I have now ordered will have the hardware designs I prefer with *some* of the new features (software). I can only hope for the quicker, brighter screen; I know the interface has been updated to the new standard which I found equally useful to the original. It is shipping now... :) As a small last insertion, the Kindle (ebook reading software) function, in the updated version, covers the text of your ebook with the menu enabled at the top, more like the Kindle White. The old Fire doesnt do this; it does, however, do it on the bottom. This will be the same between the HD and 2nd gen., so just a minor irritation. Btw, I received the sale price of $169 here so the difference in price between the HD and non-HD unit was a non-issue.I removed one star for the more yellow, darker screen with less ebook text contrast.

B002BH3I9U,electronics,How is the expectation?,"I had always wanted a pair of bluetooth headphones, but could never get myself to spend the money on them myself. I received a different pair as a gift for Christmas and loved how they could be applied to my daily life, but they were an in-ear variety that had poor sound quality and was simply uncomfortable to wear.So, i returned them & began shopping around for a decent mid-range over-ear set when I found these. The reviews were glaringly positive & I see why.Sound Quality--I'm a musician, so I have fairly well trained ears. I certainly didn't expect studio quality sound from a $40ish pair of bluetooth headphones. However, the performance and sonic quality of this item greatly exceeded any of my expectations. They sound fantastic and are perfectly acceptable for any casual listener.Microphone Recording Quality--I use Siri quite a bit on my phone & haven't had any problems related to poorly received voice commands. In voice calls the worst people have said is &#34;You sound a little different, but you sound fine.&#34; Again, perfectly acceptable for my standards.Weight--Very light weight. Zero complaints.The Fit--This is wildly different on an individual basis, so I can only relate my experience. I have a bit of a large head and wear glasses. Naturally the concern for anyone with glasses is feeling like you have a pile of stuff pulling down on your ears. These absolutely DO NOT interfere with my glasses. However, I have rather thin framed specs so it allows for plenty of extra room on my ear. That being said, even with thick emo style frames I think these would continue to work without bothering you. I even wear them with glasses while jogging on the treadmill without problems.Cell Phone Integration-- I absolutely love how well this headset works with my phones. I actually use an iPhone 5, but also have an older Evo 4G on hand. It works extremely well with both phones. It syncs quickly and easily, and the right-earphone has 4 well-disguised buttons for call/accept call, skip forward, skip back, and play/pause. All functions worked perfectly on both android and apple platforms. As a pleasant surprise I tapped the call button on my iphone while it was in a standby state. I was delighted to hear the little Siri sound blip in my ear & mic channel open to accept a voice command.Battery Life-- I've used this headset for roughly a half hour a day for a week & still going strong. It advertises 4-6 hours of use & I am inclined to believe it. It seems perfectly acceptable given the fact that this lightweight set of headphones cannot have a large battery in them weighing them down.Range-- Once again I was blown away by the performance. Last night I let my daughter play on my phone upstairs while I played with these downstairs. When I powered them on I was shocked when they connected to my phone 20 yards away through an entire floor's layer of construction. I can basically leave my phone anywhere in my house and simply keep my headset on. VERY nice for those times when you forget to stuff your phone in your pocket before walking away.Final Impressions-- I think what will make or break the use of this product for someone is simply the question of &#34;Does it fit your head?&#34; Beyond that, there's really nothing more you could possibly ask for given the dollars you'd be spending. I am sure there's a pair out there with slightly better sound or an extra button or two, but for the money you simply can't beat these. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3466, 3480)"

B00H3OYSHW,electronics,How does the selector protection  me?,"I ordered my new NewTrend Airbender Pro NT610KR from Amazon.  I received it a few days later. It was great timing because I was just getting ready to leave on a business trip. I rapidly removed it from the box.  My initial impression was great. Starting from the cool box to the wireless keyboard case. The case looks great. It feels very sturdy and nice looking.  It is little thicker than my old case (another great case from NewTrend Airbend 2.0 (NT510K)).Next, I had to charge the case to use it. I had only a few hours left before I left. Now the charging process is a little strange.  The manual says that the light indicator should be lighted in RED, but I never saw it. I waited and eventually the light turned BLUE  (maybe the RED indicator only shows when the battery is dead. I will have to post an update once the first charge is over).Then came it came to placing my iPad Air into the new case. I struggled a little. The case is very tight. It is harder to take it apart.  Putting it together was very easy once I figured out how to take it apart. Each of the important input places are protected by a small tab which fits perfectly and makes the iPad well protected.  The case comes with a screen protector which is nice (I already have my screen protector), but I figured it will provide a double protection.  Now I had everything ready for my trip.When I boarded my flight, I was finally ready to use it.  First I needed to open the case to the position that felt most comfortable. There is a release button in the on the side of the case that releases the extension arm.  I pulled it too far and it came apart.  It was no problem. Pressed the button and placed the extension arm to the right level.  Now, I was truly ready to use it, but before I use it I had to pair the wireless keyboard and my iPad Air (updated to the last iOS).  First, I could not figure out how to turn on the keyboard. I did not read the manual, but I eventually figured that I need to hold the on/off button for a few seconds to turn it on and off. Then I pressed the pairing button which connected easily to my iPad.  Used extensively the keyboard during my 10 hours flight. I wrote emails and made notes in preparations for my upcoming client meetings. The keyboard felt nice. It was not clunky and was a good size.  With my first Airbender 2.0, I had some problems with the keyboard freezing my iPad which this worked perfectly.  During my trip, the passenger next to me commented about the case too. He said it looks really nice.During the week and my flight back, the case was still working perfectly. So far, no problems. I took some pictures with iPhone 5s.

It was going well, until it melted down (known problem).  I removed the hard disk and we used it as a router only, with less overheating.  That lasted a few weeks until I started hearing panicked hollers from all corners of our condo.  Sure enough, it was time to replace our router.We wound up with the TP-LINK WDR3500.Set up was very easy, using the web browser based interface.We were back up and surfing on all of our devices in around 30 minutes from the arrival of the box until I entered the last password into the last iDevice.Not too bad.  I did set up two different networks though, so the folks who are playing can use one band and the other is used by me.So far everything has been great.  I did have to go through setup once again, after a power outage, but it was even faster than the initial set up, due to familiarity on my part.Right now we have two tablets, an ipod touch, an ailing and ancient macbook, a macmini, an XO/OLPC laptop (linux), a smartphone, and our vonage service all connecting through the TP-LINK TL-WDR3500 without any hiccups.  For the first time in years, I have a reliable wireless connection to my other computer (perfect for when it's monitor croaked) and it has been almost 2 months and my mom hasn't complained about the sound quality when she calls us and it was always an issue (for her) when our vonage box and phones were routed through the Time Capsule.There is only one USB port.  That's not an issue for us.  I did have some trouble getting my Seagate Slim drive to connect and function as a network drive, but because the connection is so seamless and reliable, I have my Labelwriter printer connected to the USB port and I hooked up a larger USB hub to the macmini which I then connected to the router.  That way I can still access everything, but it also gives me an extra layer of protection as the router requires one password and the computer another.I was upset when our Time Capsule petered out, but this router made the transition a positive one and I think I'm done with Time Capsule, but I'd recommend this to friends and family without hesitation.

I bought the &#34;body only&#34; kit so it would force me to use the Pentax lenses. The camera has some nice features that compensate for lenses that do not have auto focus, and I was able to figure this out after some time. Eventually I was able to use my zoom lens and several prime lenses, and one lens that did have auto focus. I found the focus peaking feature the best way to focus with the manual focus lenses. I was able to get several sharp photographs. However, I could not use it outside, I just could not see the screen in bright light. The only thing I could see was the focus peaking lines which helped me get a few good shots, but most outside shots were out of focus. Also the remote control software was minimal. I also discovered that when the HDMI cable is plugged in, it only supports playback and does not support live view. The battery life was dismal, it is more a function of how long the camera is on rather than the specified number of shots you can take. The battery was good for a few hours, then died.

I owned several J2 and every color of the J3 just in the past year.  The last J3 I bought in August I kept as backup in case of failure (I use them for medical transcription, sitting at my desk hardly moving for 10-12 hours daily).  I had a failure of the silver earlier this month only a few months into use; the wires seem to come loose somewhere causing loss of sound in one side. Not even 2 hours of use after opening the brand new black set, they failed. Just like all the others but the lasting time for these silver and black ones has been insanely short, and I'm extremely careful with them. I went back to J2, thinking perhaps there to be a design flaw in the J3.  Nope.  Only 4 hours into use on the first day and one side has already failed.  I'm sick of this.  I've gone through probably a dozen pair of various JLab earbuds now, most within the last year, and the timetable for failure has increased exponentially just in the past few months.  I have given this product more than its fair share of chances.No more JLab products for me. I'm just done.  They used to be amazing and long lasting.

After a month my stylus slips out and falls to the ground when I carry the iPad like a book. (and it's a pretty hefty stylus.) Part of the problem is the loop is on the narrow end of the iPad so it slips out easily when carrying at your side. I don't know why they didn't put the loop on the long edge so you could at least cup it with a hand while carrying.

B005HMKKH4,electronics,Does this provide enough storage?,"I give this drive five stars for its size - its physical dimensions - because although I have the same quibbles about it as I do with all other external drives, its size is smaller than other 2.5"" external hard drives I've seen, including the 1.5TB Seagate that I own.In the 2.5"" hard drive world - the drives that can run on just USB power - there are internal drives that you can pair with an external case and there are external drives that come in a case and with software - usually a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to help the layman back things up.  Unlike the 3.5"" hard drive world, capacities are larger earlier in the external devices, but somehow the casing and enclosed bridge (in this case SATA to USB) make the physical size larger than an internal drive with case.  This one is still a little bigger, but really quite small.  It's awesome, frankly.  To have that much capacity in something you can store just about anywhere and you don't even have to mess around with a power cord.What I don't like - and I complain about this with all external hard drives - is the included software that they want you to install to do backups, etc.  As an advanced computer user, I think it's nonsense; even my mother should be able to use the drive without any software.  Of course you don't have to use it.  The thing that annoys me is that the drive - again, like all other externals nowadays - comes with a sleep timer set, in this case at 30 minutes, so I have to install the interface software to turn that off (necessary for my intended application), and then uninstall the software to get it off my system, but all software leaves a trace after its removal.If this is your first USB 3.0 peripheral, be aware that the port on the drive is unlike any USB 2.0 port, and thus will require a different cable if you need one longer than the included ~1m cable.  More industry stupidity, so they can overcharge for the first year or so.  Look for a cheap one on Amazon so you don't have to run out to Best Buy and pay 10x too much.  Interface cables are the one thing I believe in buying as cheap as possible - and thank God for Amazon in that respect.One more note in response to another review:  prices on non-solid state hard drives have been fluctuating a lot recently because of the Thai floods, and prices of electronics on Amazon always fluctuate.  I typically check all prices before buying anything, but still end up buying from Amazon 99% of the time.  I haven't seen Best Buy have a real deal in years.  They make their money off lies that their employees tell you, either because they have been brainwashed in to believing said lies or because of commission.  Do your own price comparison when the time comes to make a purchase.The only thing I don't love about this drive is an industry problem that's not going away any time soon, and I have to just stop complaining about it (later).

B004T9RR6I,electronics,How is the unit?,"(See bottom for update )I have a wired network at the house. We've tried wireless in the past, but the signal won't penetrate the walls (they are 1 "" thick concrete boards). The last try was a few years back, and we really needed to try again. Every piece of electronics we buy has a network connection. I'm tired of running cables, installing hubs, etc.  Xbox, Wii, TV's, BluRay layers, satellite boxes, printers - the list goes on. And so do the network cables.OK, I did have some install issues and had to contact customer support, so this goes on a bit.  Bottom line, after all was said and done, this thing works FANTASTIC. There is one serious security concern - the router automatically had a wide open guest connection. You can't configure this during setup, but have to do it later. ASAP change this - set a password!  Had I not had my install issue, the install would have taken under 10 minutes. On to the review....I'm typing this review as I install the router: Default setup requires that you already have a wireless connection - that's a pretty silly assumption, since you're buying a wireless router. You don't find this out until you start installation. The instructions have you plug in the router, attach it to the internet (to the back of your cable box, etc.)  - then test for a wireless connection. If it does not find a connection, you have to redo step one, move the router next to your PC, unplug your PC from the network, and plug the router into your PC and the web. OK, so I climbed the ladder, pulled the router down from the shelf I stuck it on, and plugged it into the back of my PC with a 100' cable I had on hand.  Followed the instructions on the rest of the setup screen. It's the typical wizard interface, just follow instructions and press ""Next."" So I kept pressing ""Next."" After about three minutes I received a message - Big and bold - ""Our Customer Support team can help"" - then about 70% smaller - ""Your router was not successfully set up.""  You're then pointed to a website for help and chat. Chat. No phone number. OK, so now I need to unplug the router from the back of my PC, reattach my network cable, and visit the website. If you're like me, the computer is under your desk, pretty buried.  It's a real pain to crawl under there and swap cables. Plus you have to clean up all the stuff that missed your trash can.....OK, I follow the link. It's not a help page. It's the promo page for the product. So I have to find support myself. I find live chat. Have to fill out a short form?!  Took about two minutes to start the chat. Typical BS chat questions, asking me everything I just answered on the form I had to fill out to start the chat! Man is that annoying. Plus they want the serial number. They won't even chat without that information. Obvious from the grammar that I'm chatting with a tech-center in the Far-East. Then they want to know how many computers I have and the OS. So I tell them. Then I'm asked which computer was used to install the router. That's the first pertinent question. There's also the annoying 10-20 second gap between my sending an answer and the reply.Next: Do I use DSL and who is my ISP.  Still no question about the error.  Getting really annoyed. No, I do not use DSL. Business class broadband, five dedicated IP addresses.I'm told to (cut and paste - all replies are cut and paste, including typos):1. Reset the router, press and hold the reset button found underneath the router for 5-10 seconds (until the port lights flash at the same time) to reset the router to its factory defaults.2. Temporarily disable the Firewall or Anti-virus on the computer then Run the software. Make sure that the Ethernet Cable from the modem is connected to the Internet port of the router.OK - no reset button on the bottom of the router. Follow her instructions, but I point out that I don't have a wireless connection on my PC.  I'm told I don't need one.Reset router, disable firewall and antivirus.  Install fails. ""This computer does not appear to have wireless capability""I inform the tech. The reply? ""If this computer is not wireless then it needs to be wired to the router.""  I told her this before we started.  I feel like throwing something. Like the router.I get a reply: ""We can't proceed with the installation if the router is not yet connected to your modem and this computer is not wired to one of its nummbered ports.""My reply: Are you saying I have to have the router connected to the modem and my computer to the router? The router is over 100 feet away from my computer.Answer: ""The router needs to be plugged to your modem to work.""My reply: In other words, yes. So I need to either move a computer, move the modem, or run 100 feet of cable, right?Long delay - two minutes and counting.....three minutesAnswer: ""Yes""In other words, there was no reason to deactivate the Antivirus and Firewall. And the chat was a complete waste of time. They never asked about the error, just followed a preset script/decision tree, and wasted my time.So no wireless on your PC? You need to connect your PC to the router and the router to the web, you may have some rearranging to do. Fortunately I had that extra cat 5, 100' cable. Why require wireless already be in place? This is idiotic. Bottom line: The Reset on the router was all that was needed. Install now worked.User name and password entered, updated detected and installed. Update took four minutes. Router is installed. Now to try it out! Get rid of that 100' cable, connect my PC to the network again.Well, not so fast. It appears that my PC needs a wireless card to connect directly to the router. It's setup, it's on my network - and I need to use a wireless connection to configure it? Come on!!! Look, not every PC in an office or house is going to be wireless. My configuration/final goal - replace my hubs with wireless hubs, keeping the wired connections to the computers and devices (printers, BluRay players, TV's, etc.) The only wireless devices will be Kindles and a couple of laptops.  So I have to use a wireless device to configure the router. Pathetic.Hmmm. What to do.  Open up my DroidX, download the Cisco Connect Express App, and try that.  While that was going on, I ran the WiFi analyzer app and checked the signal strength throughout the house. Wow! It's strong everywhere. Back of the house, basement, outside. But - Woah! There are two network connections available from the router - a secured connection, and a wide-open guest connection! Gotta turn that off - but I can't connect to the router. Let's try that Droid app. I turned off WiFi to save the battery... Run the app. It requires WiFi (duh) but it can't turn it on for you. So exit the app, turn on WiFi. Try and find the app. It's not under Cisco. It's not under Router. It's called simply ""Express"" - no common sense with these people! So I run the app.""Router not found.""  My kindle finds it. The DroidX finds it. The Cisco app on the DroidX can't find it. Appears that you need to manually connect to the network, then run the app. Sheesh. So I check the connections. Hey, I AM connected to the guest connection. Let's switch to the secure connection. Man, time to pay for that 25 character long, upper/lower/numeric combination I set for a password.... Connected to the secure connection. Run the Cisco app again. It asks for the admin password. Enter password. Connected. So the error message was misleading. It should have stated that a secure connection was required.Once the app runs we see:Four options: Guest Access - Wi-Fi settings - Devices - Router ManagementChange the guest settings: Require a password, set max guests. Can't set lower than 4, so I make it 4.WiFi settings: Only allows you to change name and password.Devices:Display connected devices - a list of connected devicesManually add a device - displays the router info - Name, password, securityUse WiFi protected setup - tells you how to use the protected setup button found on some devicesRouter management:Renew IP address - renews IP, asks again when you press the optionReboot - Reboots, asks again when you press the optionFirmware update - Checks for update.Router details - All router info (model #, serial #, IP address, etc.)Hardware: runs a little hot, no way of wall mounting, looks cool and sleek.Included: Cat 5 cable, 6' - Power adapter, router, install CD.Update 4-27-12: Added aTRENDnet 300 Mbps Wireless N 4-Port Media Bridge TEW-640MB (Piano Black)to my network. This bridge has the WPS button, as does the Linksys router. Connecting the two was darn right simple. I pressed the WPS button on the bridge, and used my Droid App to access the EA4500 - pressed the WPS button on the screen. A minute later, I had a secure connection.  Attached two PC's and two printers. Checked the app again - saw all the devices connected.  At first I did not like the idea of using a wireless device to control the EA4500. But, wow, is this handy! I'm crawling around under the desk, Droid in hand, controlling the EA4500, linking to the bridge.  Did the same thing with a webcam.  Love the wireless app!  Just under a month later I returned the Trendnet Media Bridge. Kept dropping the connection, slowinf down - a real pain - and it was located within sight of the router.  Picked up a Netgear bridge instead - works flawlessly.  I'm bandwidth - so I also picked up a Netgear N900 USB wireless adapter.  I constantly get 450 mbps - this is in addition to the connection through the bridge.  I have two simultaneous connections, both wireless. Hitting 550 mbps total.Another update: I had to reset the router. The software that you installed to setup the router will NOT run. You get an error that you reset the router, and that you need to install the software again. WHAT? What if you can't find the CD?  I have never heard of anything this stupid. That cost it a star.

B0049YQVHE,electronics,What is winner?,"This ASUS router is a very attractive piece of electronic hardware, with its black diamond embossed plastic case.  It is also very fast.  I clocked it at 57.2Mbps and in the range test, it offered 34.4Mbs.  That was at the 2.4 GHz.  At 5 GHz, it clocked out at 112.6Mbps.  At this speed, I can blast through 500MB of data in just around 30 seconds.  If that is not the fastest router out there, it certainly is in the top few.  When I increased the range to 100 feet, the router still scored 76.1Mbps.However, on the downside, it does not provide a guest network on either its 2.4GHz or 5GHz radios.  I am used to having this feature so when my guests arrive, they do not have access to the files on my computer.  I am not sure why they left this feature out of this router.  Perhaps it is because it has 2 USB ports on this very thin router (to support both a printer and an attached storage device) and support for WDS bridging (you can turn off its router function and use it as a wireless bridge). Alternatively, you can configure the router as a wireless access point.  This paper-thin looks just fine on its stand, but it can just as easily lie flat as a pancake on a shelf or on my desk with its ports facing the wall.Set-up of this ASUS router was quick and easy.  I did not even use the installation CD that came in the box.  I simply used my internet browser (Chrome) and went to 192.168.1.1 and it guided me through a very easy and intuitive set-up procedure.  This Disk-Aid feature also has some other features like setting up a FREE Dynamic DNS address.  I simply had to go to the Disk-Aid and pick a unique name and then after three mouse clicks the service is up and running. After that, I can remotely access the router via the Web address:  xyz.asuscomm.com, where xyz is the unique name I picked out.  This router also supports media streaming and can stream digital content stored on the external hard drive to UPnP-compliant network media streamers.This is a heck of a router for the price.  I looked at the Cisco models and they were much more expensive for the same features (sans the guest network feature).  Nevertheless, even with that omission, this is a great deal for the power, performance and range I get with this router. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2253, 2267)"
B009F1JL5A,electronics,How heavy is the laptop?,"So, after reading hundreds of computer reviews, I decided to go with this Asus.  I was impressed that a touch screen would be fairly affordable (similar non-touch laptops were in the $500-600 range, so this wasn't a big jump).  I was also excited about the hybrid hard drive, so I took the plunge and bought it.First of all, it's a gorgeous computer.  The brushed black back is lovely and the computer is sleek and smooth and beautiful.  I was already in love when I took it out of the box.  It's light--4 lbs--and super easy to fit into a backpack or even a large purse.  I turned it on, set up Windows 8 (which is initially confusing as heck, even for someone who is totally comfortable using computers), and I started playing with the apps so that I could get a sense of how well the touch screen worked.  I had no problem using the gestures, like pinch to zoom, two-finger scrolling, and panning.  It's as sensitive as any tablet I've used.  Wonderful!  I did briefly have trouble with the touchpad, but after installing all the Asus updates and Windows 8 updates, all is well.  You can do all of the same gestures on the touchpad, by the way.  And the touchpad is huge!  I like it, but it's different than what I'm used to.Okay, so on to the other stuff.  Just so you know, I am a PhD student, so I often have multiple programs open: Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Adobe Reader, etc.  I don't require the kind of CPU and memory as someone who does more intensive computing or gaming, but I do notice when things begin to lag.  Things I care about: USB 3.0 (there is one), the touch screen, the sound quality, and ability to run 3-6 programs smoothly and quickly.  As I said, the touch screen is great.  The sound quality is also surprisingly good, and it gets significantly louder than my old laptop.  With headphones plugged in, the sound is excellent, even at the lowest volumes (I've been listening at approx. 12% volume).  And the computer has been great with multiple programs.  I have only had it for a few days, but I've been putting it through the ringer.  So far, it's passed with flying colors.  It's gorgeous, it runs smoothly and quickly for my needs, and it seems to be an awesome product.  This computer and I are a match made in heaven. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2276, 2290)"

B001G5ZTLS,electronics,How is the ability?,"If you are a canon user with a significant investment in L-Glass from previous crop bodies, you will want to consider getting this camera or the next iteration of it. This is a full frame camera that provides great resolution for awesome cropping or wide angle shots. Although the current AF system is old, it is still very good. You will need to make sure your glass and body are at their optimum calibration as it is possible that even new out of the box to be slightly off. The factory will calibrate any Canon products within the first year for free. I suggest that you take them up on the deal. The only cost is your shipping to them. They are fast and good at what they do. Be aware that every lens can be off in either direction from zero being a front or back focussing issue. The body itself can be off, so do make sure the setup is right before doing any comparisons. All EOS models now offer micro adjustments to limit the need for sending out for calibration if you don't have the ability to part with your equipment for a few days.The 5D Mark II takes stunning crisp photos. I've tested with 24-70 2.8L USM, 70-200 2.8L USM, 50mm 1.4, 85mm 1.8 with very good results. The HD video is a bonus. The lack of autofocus is not the worst trade off. The option to take clips of video when needed is nice though.If you are on the fence about brand to choose and have not invested to much in one brand or another, do look into both Nikon, and Canon for the best options for you. The extra focus points are really nifty on the d700, but the lack of resolution and HD video option on the canon side is a big plus. Those moving up from existing Canon Digitals will appreciate the faster and more accurate focus that comes with all 9 points being in focus with hidden focus point assisting the crisp focus to the corners. I'm very pleased with this model and the options for indoor and outdoor shooting. ISO is so good that 3200 is better than 1600 on my 50D.  The only issues I've had are with the slower continuous shooting FPS, and the flimsy shutter sound that does not inspire confidence in comparison to my 50D's fast and bold thuds. Ironically, the 5D2's capable of locking on to the targets in low light even with a delayed shutter will capture action more reliably than the 50D. I shoot a lot of indoor night shots in poorly lit gyms that the 5D2 outshines the 50D on the keeper rate with the identical lenses. The 50D has become my outdoor maximum reach tool. Even then the crops from the 5D2's are better. Its just the case where I carry the contrasting distance lenses to avoid missing shots altogether.A great camera that is up there with the really high end SLR's with a much lower entry level. Glass is still expensive but you can keep that for ever if you take care of it.Edit:After several years of pure magic from this camera and replacing the 50D with a 7D. The 7D is the next best thing to the 5D2 when the 5D3 is not an economical addition to your gear. The 5D2 has an incredible ISO range with such great image clarity, even with action shots in less than perfect lighting. Shooting side by side with the 7D has me wishing I just had 2 5D2's. This camera is the most affordable professional Full Frame camera on the market. It is still that great after all these years. Lenses go up in price, while bodies come down in price.

B00BGGDVOO,electronics,Do you have any computer with mouse?,"After deciding to ditch cable TV I started to research alternative set-top-boxes that can provide on-demand content in addition to allowing live streams. The Roku showed up everywhere - blog posts about ditching cable, forums, and reviews. This encouraged me to take the plunge.I was quickly disappointed - the Roku is not a cable box replacement. Nearly it's entire library and design is only centred around the idea of on-demand content, not live streams. The Remote control included is ONLY Wifi, with no Infrared, so if you want to program your universal remote with it you're all out of luck. Neither me nor my spouse liked this included ""toy"" remote or the interface design.The big problem with it, in my opinion, is that each channel is completely separate. Say you want to watch a movie, or see what is streaming on a twitch channel or talk radio station - you have to go into that specific channel/app then look, and then go back to the home screen and move onto the next channel - rinse and repeat. If you've just got home from work and are tired you just want to relax in front of the TV, and the Roku does not provide that experience - if you have lots and lots of channels it's just not possible. This would be excusable if it was android based using existing apps, but this is a brand new platform, they could have done so much more, yet it offers nothing more than many gaming consoles or android mini-PCs.If the Roku could smartly combine my YouTube subscriptions, Netflix movies, and show me what shows were playing on live streams, all at the same time, it might be onto something. It would be great for independent content creators to make their own live streams that could be installed and immediately show up in a central guide. This limitation makes the technology feel early and I don't want to be an early adopter, especially if it doesn't feel like the device will ever become this.I will give some positives - the interface is very fast, certainly the fastest Youtube and Netflix interfaces I've ever seen on a non-PC.

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,How is the device?,"First of all, it is not a miracle device. What Chromecast does is to cast ""cast-supported"" apps from your smart phones, tablets, and stream media from your laptops and PCs to the TV on the same local network (LAN).Setup is easy and straight-forward. Connect Chromecast to your TV, download Chromecast apps from Google Play / iTune to your device, making sure Wifi-is on, setup Chromecast's Wifi connection via your mobile device, and it is done. Setup only needs to be done once. Other supported devices connected to the same local network will then all be able to use the same Chromecast.Now Google Play has a section dedicated to Chromecast compatible apps. For some reason, this section is only shown via Google Play app, not browser version, but going to chromcast.com/apps would also give you the list. Currently the selection is quite limited, with a great deal of them just variations of apps for streaming media from your local computers and media servers to Chromecast. Others like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and so on frequently requires paid subscription to truly make a difference.Basically, Chromecast combines your mobile device and TV into a fast-response SmartTV.The Touch-Ups which could potentially make Chromecast a perfect device:Currently, the only way to cast PC Desktop screens onto Chromecasted TV is to download the Google Chrome extension ""Google Cast"" by Google (sorry, mobile Google Chrome is currently not supported). It gives your the option to stream a dedicated browser Tab or cast the entire desktop screen. However, there are some flaws:1. In general, casting would mess up your Google Chrome ""non-maxed"" window size. It is a mild annoyance, but still annoying anyhow.2. Tab cast mode has no option to display mouse cursor. Not an issue for portable laptops, but a serious issue for a casting PC from another room.3. Desktop cast mode does display mouse cursor, but it could only cast the whole desktop. If you have a multiple monitor setup, it practically makes the cast useless.4. Neither Tab mode nor Desktop mode have build-in PC control mechanism. Although this could be easily fixed by using app such as ""Unified Remote,"" it is still one extra step.*How 4. works, Google Cast to cast PC desktop + Unified Remote on your tablet/smart phone to control the PC -> result displays on TV**Better solution: Chomecast app integrates with Google Cast. It still needs PC, TV, and mobile device to work, but require one less app to install.If the above touch-ups could be implemented, Google Chromecast could be a potentially monopoly-accused TV casting device.

B000UHE8Y2,electronics,What is your opinion about the the pause feature?,"This is my first ""gaming"" mouse to use, so am used to the generic Dell-type mice everyone gets with their computers or wireless package --- small, 2 buttons, center scroll wheel, no crazy angled shape to the design.  So using those I've always used a ""claw/finger"" grip and lift the mouse with my fingers.  This mouse is GREAT for that!  The ""small"" cover/grip is nice and flat on the sides with a small footprint.  99% of the other gaming mice out there have a huge palm-grip design with all these crazy grooves for your thumb, long enough to rest your whole hand on, etc.  If that's the kind of mouse you like, then this might not be for you as even the ""large"" cover/grip is really only slightly larger than the ""small"" grip.  It's a little more contoured, but isn't gigantic where you're gonna rest your hand on it.Great feature is you can set 5 different sensitivity points on it in 200 intervals from 200-3200.  Any 5 you want!  Easy to change and play around with.Only negative I have so far is the weights.  Like I said, using the ""claw"" grip one picks up the mouse from time to time with the thumb and pinky/ring fingers.  Well the weights are in the back/rear side of the mouse, so when I pick up the mouse it tilts/pivots back a little which DOES move the cursor initially.  Used to the 50/50 weight distribution and possibly mice not SO sensitive!  Maybe I need to play with the weights a lil more, play with my grip, or just remove them entirely (which is a shame as it takes that feature of the mouse away).  Might have to hand make a little weight at the top where the cord goes in to balance it out if I get that industrious. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1642, 1656)"

B00009R6TA,electronics,Where can I get  extra space room for trucks?,"Please note that I am not comparing this backpack to any other camera backpack. I am simply making a value judgement based on the price I paid -- about $35.00.I've had the pack for about two weeks now, and have loaded it up with a bunch of stuff, including two digital bodies, three zoom lenses, a Speedlite flash, a pocket tri-pod, a flash diffuser and an extra lense bag.  All of that is inside the main compartment. I am very pleased with how the main compartment can be sub-divided to fit just about any camera attachments you might have. Padding all around is quite adequate, although a bit more could be used at the top of the bag where the camera body and lense typically sit.The two zippered mesh compartments inside the main flap hold quite a bit of stuff, including the camera manual, flash manual, and various extra flash cards and batteries.The two velcroed pockets on either side of the bag are not designed to protect, but to hold stuff. That's fine with me, so I don't put anything in them that I mind getting wet or dusty.The main compartment flap has two zippered pockets on the outside. The bigger of the two pockets unzips on both sides and the top, and reveals two more small pockets and a small snap-hook. I use this pocket to store a photographic magazine or two I'm reading, cables, etc.The other zippered pocket on the main flap zips across the top and is wide and deep enough to hold quite a bit more stuff, stuff that is flat or can be flattened.The very outside of the main flap also has an open, expandable stretch-cord pocket that can be used to stuff in a light windbreaker.My impression is that this bag has so many pockets and compartments that you could overload it if you are not careful. Before using this bag, I had cameras and accessories in three different ""regular"" camera bags. Now it's all in one place, and I would not consider going back to a regular camera bag -- even if I do have to set the pack down before opening it up to retrieve cameras and accessories.Regarding quality of material and work, I am quite pleased. No frayed straps, no broken buckles, no weak seams, no shoddy workmanship.So the question is, for $35.00 did I get a good camera backpack? My answer without hesitation is, ""Yes."" Does this pack have the same quality and features of a $65.00 or $100.00 pack. No, of course not.BOTTOM LINEFor $35.00 my expectations were exceeded by this bag. At this price I see it as a real bargain. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2447, 2461)"
B002MAPRYU,electronics,How is the fm reception?,"You can't really go wrong with this. I've had it for a few months and wanted to make sure it wouldn't cheat me before reviewing. Its battery life is quite good--definitely 5+ hours of MP3. The battery indicator is perhaps not fantastic; I've found it run out of juice at times I wouldn't necessarily have expected it. I guess it works, but it's not linear, so don't assume you have half power left when the battery bar is half full (but then most devices are terribly calibrated for battery power, aren't they?).Sound is fine. Frankly, who knows. I use cheap earphones and crank music while working out with this.Radio reception is quite good.The thing is small and light. I think you'd possibly have to be on medication to buy a similarly priced screenless Apple mp3 player instead of this.Only real complaint is that navigating music isn't quite as easy as I'd like. I really like to navigate mp3s like I do within windows--I don't care about ID3 tags, genres, etc.--and it seems a bit iffy for that.I have to give HUGE PROPS to this thing's FWD and RWD and this is absolutely beyond equal in its awesomeness. Since I listen to a lot of very long tracks I make great use of this. Basically if you hold down to go forward or backward, the longer you hold it the faster it gets. So for example hold it down for five seconds and perhaps it's skipped ahead 1 minute of track. Hold it down 5 seconds more and perhaps 3 minutes of track. Keep holding it down and it starts going ahead minutes at a time, it's a very nice feature and I cannot stress enough how nice this little touch is. It's kind of like the wheel: once it was invented you wonder how life could have been worthwhile beforehand. At least that's what my grandfather told me when it was invented and he was a boy.

B001V9LPT4,electronics,How do you get so high?,"I ordered a pair of these for my dad and I about 6 months ago. My dad loves his old music and didn't think headphones were a big deal until he got these from me for x-mas. I think I accidentally turned him into a bit of an audiophile lol. As for myself, I love these things.The quality is truly amazing. The bass is VERY clean even at very high levels and not overwhelming by any means. The mids and highs are very very nice as well. You can hear so many things extra going on in your music than before making it a completely new experience even with a mobile device. I even tried these out on my FiiO e10 amp/dac and they are even more amazing!I've listened to other earbuds and found these are the best suited for me at a decent price. I can wear these all day long for days on end and not even notice them being in. By far the most comfortable I have ever had. Another great point is the noise cancelling. There is this fat redneck piece of crap that rides in the back of the bus that never ever shuts up with the most annoying girlish cackle that puts you into an instant rage when wanting to sleep. These buds with a very low volume drowns him out very well surprisingly and I sleep great! Definitely a huge bonus when I am away from home for 17 hours a day.Beats headphones are a bloody joke! It annoys me to no end to see people buying that garbage just because it's signed by an uneducated rapper. :\ I've had a lot of earbuds to know those things don't even compare to the cheapest plastic ear ripping garbage out there. My coworkers I ride the bus with (very long ride every day ugh) are so brainwashed thinking they can somehow justify that massive price they paid. I showed them mine and I could see them lie when they said the Beaters were better. I'll enjoy my music thank you and they can continue to have an orgy of stray cats fighting over living territory in their ears.In summary, I'm far from being an audiophile. Very far. From my experience, headphones were always just that: headphones. Now I've realized they can be so much more! From my experiences, these babies pretty much alleviate any complaints of other headphones I have had in the past. Of course the quality isn't quite at audiophile levels but for the price, they are beyond exceptional. These have got to be the best value out there tailored for my tastes.

B003VAHYTG,electronics,Do you think it is a good cooling system?,"I love listening to music and watching movies on my computer, but I have always relied on relatively cheap speakers (or even my built-in laptop speakers) to provide my sound. I decided to order these speakers and take my music and videos to ""the next level"" and see if these speakers could deliver the loud, clear, and rich sound I expect from more expensive stereo systems and speakers.Below are my positive and negative evaluations of the Logitech Z623 speaker system.Positive:- The subwoofer is huge, and provides a nice, rich, bass sound. I am amazed at the loudness and clarity of the bass.- The speakers may seem little, but they produce a big and rich sound, with very little vibration or feedback.- The overall sound quality and clarity is impressive. When I listened to my favorite songs, I heard sounds and instruments I had never heard before. Watching videos with these speakers has opened up an entirely new (and great) listening experience!- To test the unit's power, I turned the volume on full blast (with the computer volume turned on full as well) and the sound was pretty much flawless.  I didn't hear any rattling or feedback. These speakers are pretty loud, and definitely loud enough for what I need.Negative:- The cords are a little short, but not too short as to be annoying.- The unit is large (the entire set weighs about 22 lbs). This means that moving the speakers and subwoofer is a little inconvenient. I am used to moving speakers around with my laptop. I really can't do this with these speakers.Overall, this is a great speaker system, and I am glad I upgraded from the cheap speakers. Until now, I didn't know what I was missing using cheaper speakers. I plan on using these speakers any time I watch a video, listen to music, or play games. Their loud and rich sound has turned my computer into a powerful stereo system (I want to throw a party just to show them off!).

B004J3ZV62,electronics,Do you know film a video?,"I got this camera a week ago and have been disappointed.  I decided on Canon because I had one years ago and really liked it.  The quality seems to have gone downhill. The best feature is the compact size.  I find the ""smart auto"" not to be so smart.  The images are usually over-exposed and at times out of focus.  It's as if the camera can't figure out what I want to photograph and instead picks some detail I'm not interested in.  The menus are not obvious and I have to keep running to the computer to read the manual, which is not very handy if I'm away from the computer.  I got this to replace an old HP digital camera that took great photos.  The image quality of the Canon is much worse.  I suspect that the HP had a much better quality lens.  The battery needs to be recharged after about 170 photos.  I haven't tried the video yet, but I suspect that will shorten the battery life even more.  I was used to taking 250-300 photos with my previous camera before changing the battery.  I read some reviews that said not to even bother with the smart auto mode and I think they are right.  I need to experiment with the ""P"" mode to see if I can get some decent photos with this camera.  I had considered getting a cheaper model of the Canon powershot camera but opted for this more expensive one because of the extra feature.  I think the extra money was not well spent since the Canon ELPH 300 performs about as well as a camera costing half as much.  To be fair, I've only had the camera a week and there is a steep learning curve.  If things improve over the next few weeks, I'll add an update and may give this camera a higher rating.  At this time I'm feeling disappointed.Addendum (6/5/11): I've now had several more days to play with the camera and after trying all kinds of settings the picture quality is not much better.  I finally made some videos, which looked nice, but the microphones picked up a lot of extraneous noise even indoors in a quiet room and introduced a kind of background hum into the audio.  If the quality of sound doesn't matter to you, the videos are quite nice.  I've decided to keep the camera because it's so compact and I plan to take it on trips.  The photos are passable but nothing spectacular.  The problems with focusing and overexposure have continued.  I think the lens is just not as good quality as in previous cameras I've owned, including an old Canon.  Maybe the fault lies in me since I'm not an expert on photography. A friend who is a serious photographer offered to go over the camera with me, so after we get together I'll have a better idea.Addendum (6/24/11):  I had this camera for over 3 weeks now and have taken hundreds of photos with it.  My original impression has not changed.  It takes decent photos in general.  The AUTO feature is useless and needs to be avoided outdoors because it totally over-exposes the photos.  It's kind of ludicrous that you can't use the AUTO feature outdoors on a point and shoot camera.  Indoors the AUTO function is acceptable.  The Programable mode does a better job, and it's all that I use now.  Generally I'm disappointed with the quality of the images and It think this has to do with the cheap lens this camera uses.  As I said previously, it is nowhere near the quality of previous Canon cameras I have owned.  The best feature is the small size of the camera, so I will be keeping it and using it on vacations because it is so portable. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3446, 3460)"

I've used them for listening to music, watching TV, playing video games, and I also plug them into my amp to play bass guitar (A 1/4"" adapter is included in the box). They have served me well for all of these purposes. I am just a general user, not an audiophile, and can't dissect the sounds like a connoisseur at a wine tasting, but they sound good to me.The headphones are a little tight, and I have to situate them just right if I am going to use them for longer than an hour or so. You can adjust the actual headphone part up and down, which gives you some choice in how they sit on your head. For me, they are more comfortable if I adjust them a bit longer than needed to get a snug fit.They have become more comfortable over time. Either there is a break-in period, or I just needed to get used to them.I love the long cable and the little spool to wind it up is very useful; I don't have to sit and untangle the cable like I do with ear buds.I thought that I would feel all 1980's AV Club with these on, but they don't look too goofy. They are really pretty small and sleek for over-the-ear headphones.I think that the quality is very good for the price and I recommend them for anyone looking for this style of headphones.

B001KC08A4,electronics,What remote control is amazing?,"We have a home theater setup behind cabinet doors in our living room so I installed a single infrared sensor on the outside of the cabinets connected to an infrared amplifier and infrared transmitters attached to each of six components.  We also have two smaller HT setups downstairs in an exercise room and a hobby room.  We enjoy occasional upgrades or component changes so universal remotes are very important accessories. After years of frustration with the buggy and difficult-to-program Harmony series of remotes, I checked with an HT professional on something better. This is what he recommended.  We now have five of these; three upstairs (for convenience) and two downstairs. We have had them in service for about four years and I can highly recommend them. They are built to last, very well designed, powerful and flexible yet easy to program.  I have yet to find a device or component that cannot be controlled in every conceivable way. These remotes are easy to program but I recommend keeping notes so that it's easy to come back later to tweak (improve) the programming later after using it for a while.  I would also recommend avoiding the &#34;punch through&#34; feature unless you have a very simple setup.  The problem with the punch through feature is that you have to give up full control of the device you are punching through.  It is a trade-off for convenience versus control.  One more tip: When the range or button responsiveness isn't quite right, try fresh batteries.  Battery life is very good but there is no battery life indicator and they continue to work somewhat on depleted batteries.  The good news is that they take two AA's, so no big deal.

B0007QKMQY,electronics,How big is the camera?,"A few reviewers have purchased the Canon 20D rather than the Rebel XT (350D), because the Canon 20D's body is covered with a magnesium alloy and the Rebel XT's body is mainly plastic. However, one should not discount the Rebel's plastic body. It's made of polycarbonate. I did a little research on this material and found that it is virtually unbreakable and in laminated form is used to make ""bullet-resistant glass."" Of course, no matter how tough the body is, something else will break, such as the lens or the internal workings, if the camera is dropped on a hard surface. That's why I always place the camera's strap around my neck before handling it.Although a couple of reviewers stated that the camera feels too light, I've found that it has plenty of heft with my 28-135mm lens.The Rebel XT is an excellent camera.

B0074BW614,electronics,Is this manual useful?,"I had originally bought a Kindle Fire for my mom to read books when she went on vacation. I played around with it for a week or two (loading it with eBooks and making sure I was familiar with it before handing it over) During the time I really enjoyed the device, but wasn't sure I had enough of a need to buy my own.In comes the Kindle Fire HD 7"" I happened to be at Best Buy checking them out when I realized that I do buy books quite frequently, and that I could use one. I took a few days to decide what device was best for me, and thanks to the people I work with I had a chance to compare the Kindle Fire HD and a Nexus 7 side by side.Comparison, Performance wise they are a very close match, I would say the Nexus is slightly faster over all. but not enough that it would matter in the end. my deciding factor was the Amazon experience. I wanted that User Interface, where I see what I am looking for as soon as I turn on the device. I did not want the  distractions of other games and apps to have the chance to prevent me from reading the books that I bought the tablet for. So I ended up getting the Kindle Fire at Best Buy a few days later.since I have picked up the Kindle Fire HD I have found that I use it to watch YouTube and Netflix a lot while cooking or being in the kitchen. I also take it with me where ever I go, I can get amazing Wifi signal when in the city. Thanks to the Dual-Band Wifi in this thing I get better signal than I do on my laptop. I find thanks to the Wifi Signal I tend to surf the internet more on my Kindle than my laptop.The Screen Is amazing as well. When watching Netflix or Amazon Prime the Videos look fantastic. I haven't tried loading videos on it to take with me on the Go, But i am sure the quality will be amazing just like Netflix or Prime.Also while watching movies the best thing about the Kindle Fire compared to any other tablet is the speakers. They are simply amazing. You get good quality sound without any distortion. and decent bass too. This is great when you are trying to watch videos and there are dogs barking in the background, or maybe  a car driving by you can still hear what you are watching and not have to deal with crackling or other interference from the speakers.I have shown this tablet to a few of my friends, and so far one has bought it (also loves it) and the other is still on the fence (but leaning toward the Kindle Fire HD) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2409, 2423)"
B000093UDQ,electronics,Was the mini tripod great?,"I just received my Digital Concept TR-60N tripod. It is actually 57-inches tall instead of the 55 listed. I was very skeptical about buying this tripod for my Nikon D90 at first because I had read all the reviews and saw many people saying that it isn't suited to support a larger digital slr, but this is just not the case. I just went out and shot for 5 hours with this, my 18-105mm lens attached to my Nikon D90 and I got some nice shots with it. The main reason I needed a tripod in the first place is to be able to shot in bulb mode with my wireless remote and this tripod was just that and you can't beat the price. I would also recommend getting the AmazonBasics wireless remote, it works exactly the same as the Nikon brand one. I will also attach a photo I took with this tripod to let you see how well it works. The tripod does look quite cheap in construction, but it doesn't feel so cheap that it will break. I would totally recommend this tripod for a budgeted consumer needing a tripod for a digital slr.

B000IBNXX2,electronics,How is the navigation?,"I bought this player so I could simplify my music-listening while I drive up and down I5 each weekend.IT WAS A MISTAKE.I've had it just over 24 hours and I've already had to reset it at least three times (yes, I updated the firmware).  The player died (wouldn't turn on) and froze (wouldn't turn off). Unfortunately the player has to rebuild the music library each time you reset it and that can take up to 5 minutes.  There've been at least 30 times that the music has stopped playing for no reason, and I have to press ""pause"" then ""play"" to get it to play again.  I drove for about 5 hours today and the battery is almost totally dead (I started out with a full charge).  The player turns itself off instead of sleeping, so every time you pause it and run an errand or take a phone call or whatever, if you don't make it back in time, you have to start it up again (and THAT TAKES FOREVER--FOR! EVER!).  Also it makes the most pathetic creaky cheap-toy plastic noises when you handle it (even without pushing any buttons), because the buttons are made of two pieces of plastic that touch each other.The organization and navigation of this thing suck.  I have a car stereo that plays MP3 CDs, and the navigation is painfully simple:  Press the joystick up or down to flip through folders, and press right or left to choose a song. EASY!  I assumed (like a dodo) that an MP3 player as well-received as the Zen V Plus would work on a similar principle.  I was WRONG.  The Zen V Plus sorts by tags, and you can choose to select by artist, album, or genre, or select all tracks. I put a 6-CD compilation on the Zen V Plus, so there are around 100 different artists from that comp alone; with all of the other albums on the player, there are a couple hundred artists in the artist list.  So, yes, I sometimes have to scroll through a hundred or more artists to find the one I want. Did I mention I got this player to use while I'm DRIVING? Can't scroll and drive.  I guess I could simplify the process by hooking up the Zen to my computer, firing up the MP3 management software and creating a playlist, but the software is a joke.  Regardless, once you have a playlist, you still have to navigate through the menus to pick the playlist, then scroll through everything in that list; you can't even re-sort the list (e.g., by artist or album title) as far as I can tell.  If you make a playlist of all of the songs, you might have to flip through 300 of them to get where you want to be. You also have to update that list each time you add/remove albums from the player.  An alternative would be to make a zillion playlists and scroll through those. I don't want to! I shouldn't have to.  So, long story short, ha ha, to get access to all of your albums, you have to either select every album and scroll through songs individually, by the hundreds, or you have to stop after each album and go into the menu and navigate to the next album or playlist, which you can't do while you're driving.  The player doesn't go from the end of album A to the beginning of album B. It stops at the end of A (you can put it on repeat if you want). And just to make this clear as daylight:  In a playlist, you cannot skip over an entire album with just the push of a button.  You have to skip each song until you get to the next album on the list (20 songs on the album you don't like? Then you'll have to push 20 times to get past it). I just want to be able to listen to my albums continuously, in alphabetical order by band - album title, and skip over an entire album if I don't feel like hearing it. That isn't asking much.The alarm feature on this is nonsense.  The ""alarm"" is a black dialog box on the screen. Great alarm, right?The headphones that came with this player are insulting.  They feel awful and they sound rotten (distortion at volume level 8 [of 25]). I'm to the point that I'm wondering if someone dropped the whole thing in a lake on its way to me.  How could anyone think it's okay to sell something like this?So...any good points?  I guess one good thing about this player is that you don't have to look at the controls to operate them (as long as you don't have to look at the screen, I mean). It's easy to tell which control is which by touch. I can't think of any other good points offhand.  I would say ""The Creative Zen V Plus has never personally tried to kill me"" but I'm not totally sure that's true.If anything in this review is inaccurate, please advise! If I can't return this piece, I'd like to know how to make it less useless and aggravating. I'd consult the user manual but it's essentially useless as well.  Thanks for reading!  Please excuse the negative tone here; I am just really disappointed.  If you get one of these, I hope you have better luck than I've had.

This pair didn't tickle my fancy as the volume was just too low. I wanted to use it on my PS3, but the volume was so low that the in game audio was like whispering. My Laptop struggled to put out a good sound and I had to crank up the volume by a lot.Secondly, the bass is lacking. It is not totally absent and in fact seemed reasonable in most scenarios. Weirdly however, there were some particular songs where the bass was totally absent while my cheap Sony in ear buds had rich bass in those same songs. The inconsistent performance with the bass coupled with the extremely quite sound turned me off.I am returning these headphones at the earliest. I am purchasing the Superlux HD681. After a lot of research from sites like Head-fi.org I found that these don't seem to have the same issues as the Sennheiser HD201 and overall seem to have good performance, perhaps better than the Sennheiser in some respects even.It was a shame really.

B00889ST2G,electronics,What was the best result?,"The Sony RX100 is a great camera overall, but has some weaknesses in the performance area that take some of the shine away from the overall shooting experience.Image quality at lower ISOs is excellent. Sharp, detailed, good dynamic range. There are two issues I have with this camera, however. First off, it has a tendency to overexpose and clip highlights. Secondly, while it keeps noise at bay through ISO1600, it seems to do this through very aggressive noise reduction at ISO800 and beyond, taking a toll on fine detail. The Olympus XZ-2 on the other hand, has more noise at ISO800 but also more detail. Personally, I like cameras that retain fine detail better and don't mind a little noise. But to say that the RX100 is an open and shut case as far as IQ is concerned (when compared to its competitors)...not quite.I am not particularly thrilled about the F4.9 at the telephoto end but the lens has nice characteristics otherwise so I really don't see that as a negative overall. What is a negative overall is how long it takes for the lens to zoom in and out and it's loud when it does it.The autofocus performance on this camera is somewhat disappointing in low-light. It's fine in the daytime but in low-light it's almost as slow as the much less-expensive Powershot S100. Also I had issues with the image stabilization is not great on the camera for some reason. I found in a lot of instances that you had to hold onto the camera very tightly in order to get a blur-free shot. I think that is inexcusable for a $650 camera.Some people have commented on the battery life of this camera. It's not the greatest but that's one of the trade-offs you have to make with a small pocket camera. Your best bet is just to get an extra battery.The LCD screen on back is very nice being somewhat viewable in direct sunlight. The menu system on the camera is a very nice and more straight-forward than other Sony cameras that I've used. The dial up front doesn't have decisive clicks that the Powershot S100 has but it's still nice to have considering that some enthusiast cameras don't have it at all.Ergonomics-wise, I think this camera could use some improvement. The shiny metal body is slippery up front and could benefit from some sort of grip or textured surface to make the camera more secure in your hand.Video generally looks nice, I haven't tested it much. But it generally is sharp and the audio sounds good.I think the RX100 was a respectable first compact enthusiast camera for Sony. And indeed, it's remarkable they were able to take a relatively large sensor and put it in such a compact light-weight camera. It's image quality is a cut above any enthusiast compact out there. But it has some performance-related issues that need refinement. Not terrible, but it could have been better on a $650 camera. Overall though, a great first enthusiast compact from Sony.

I feel like it's going to be quite a while before I even need to move videos and photos off of the card to make room for more. I have other Transcend SD cards in smaller sizes and those work great too. The price on this card is definitely better than I could find for other brands of the same size, as well.Update (07/13/12):I found a problem with this card if you're using it in a DSLR for video. I have a Canon T3i and when I shoot video sometimes (well, probably more than half of the time) it will stop recording either within seconds of hitting record or a couple minutes later. I did a search online and what it seems to be is when you go back through your card and delete certain photos or videos that aren't at the end of the sequence it leaves gaps in the memory, then when you record a video it tries to fill those gaps before continuing at the end of the memory card. Basically, I have to save everything to my computer and format my memory card while it's in my camera before doing any video shoots to make sure this doesn't happen. It seems to work fine if I do that. In theory, if you don't delete anything that's not at the end of the number sequence, it should work fine as long as you have room, but I don't always look at each picture and decide whether or not to delete it before taking another. I have read that this isn't an issue with some other brands like San Disk, but haven't tried for myself.

There is no noise or distortion at high volume levels. The sound is clear and easy to understand (I use it to play documentaries).So, I needed something portable and loud, and this fits the bill perfectly. It also comes with a carrying case, which has a small pocket to hold the power adapter and remote. Speaking of the remote, it's not as sensitive as I expected it to be. Because it's IR-based instead of RF, you have to point it directly at the front of the speaker unit. It's not really a big deal, and it's better than no remote at all I guess.The only other similar option (AC powered and rechargeable battery) from Logitech isZ515 Wireless Speaker, and while I have not tried those speakers, I would think the extra iPod port in S715i makes these a little more valuable.Overall, I highly recommend these if clear audio, loudness, and portability are important to you.

B0035ERKYW,electronics,How was the quality?,"The Microsoft Mouse has come a long way since it's 1983 introduction. It was 1982 when the company decided that because no one had come up with a good way to use their Multi-Tool Word (later Microsoft Word) for MS-DOS and for Xenix, so in 1983, Microsoft created and shipped their first PC-compatible mouse, which was the beginning of Microsoft Hardware. Unlike most MS-DOS programs at the time, Word was designed to be used with a mouse, and putting it simply, it was a clunky device with a weighted ball mouse inside, and had a cord that plugged into the serial port of the PC. But for this user, it was an amazing device that made word processing far easier.In 1984, PC Magazine columnist John C. Dvorak stated the mouse as a reason the Macintosh would fail. That obviously didn't happen, and the rest is history.I bought thisMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessas a result of having two from another manufacturer that were having problems with the rubberized sides peeling off, and because the small 'glide pads' on the bottom had peeled off after using them for a few years. Had bought aLogitech Wireless Mouse M505for my MacBook Pro earlier this year as a replacement, and this new one from Microsoft was destined for use with my Windows 7 PC. Sometimes it's good to have products for comparison.Likes:+ Blue Track Technology; offers excellent tracking, very smooth+ Rubberized sides; provide a very comfortable grip+ On/Off switch; located on the base, saves battery life+ Excellent ergonomics; fits the hand quite nicely+ Behaves well with both Windows 7 and Mac OS X 10.8.x+ Nano Transceiver; stores easily in base when being transported+ Scroll wheel has good sensitivity; smooth and stable+ Runs from one AA battery; included; Microsoft claims up to 8 months life+ Ambidextrous; works well with right or left hand operation+ Good packaging; comes in a cardboard box that's easy to openDislikes:- None so farOverview:I was curious how thisMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessmight be different from theMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 - Loch Ness Gray. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it all seems to be in the packaging. The one marked ""3500 for Business"" comes in an easy-to-open recyclable brown cardboard box, which is a plus point for this user... no clamshell packaging to deal with.This mouse is smooth and easy to set up... it's simple plug & play with either the PC or the Mac, and I've tested it with both. It's responsive, and though the scroll wheel has a slight ""bumpier"" feel than the Logitech M505, it's adjustments are easy to adjust within the Windows Control Panel. The Logitech has a greater life with batteries, but that's because it uses two AA batteries as opposed to one AA cell with the Microsoft product, so that's a wash.As far as sensitivity and accuracy go, both of these models appear to be about equal, and both can be customized to fit your needs from within the software settings. The Logitech M505 is slightly longer, and the Microsoft is almost identical in size and shape to a Logitech M305; both fit the hand quite well and have an excellent ergonomic feel. Only time will tell if the rubberized sides and feet will stay on longer than those on the Logitech M305. Looking back across the history of the various Microsoft (and other) mouse units that I've had over the years back to the days of those with wired interfaces, it's amazing how much the technology has progressed over the years.TheMicrosoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 for Businessfeels and works like a good, solid product, yet it would be hard for this user to recommend it above the Logitech M505. Though slightly different in size and shape, both have an excellent ergonomic feel. The Microsoft 3500 with its Loch Ness Gray finish does have a good, businesslike appearance as opposed to looking like a work of art, so if that matters to you, then it's a good choice.11/23/2012 ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3915, 3929)"
B00DVFLJDS,electronics,What is the best color?,"Tablets of all kinds are a lot of fun for me, and as an owner of last year's Asus Google Nexus 7 Tablet (8 GB) - Quad-core Tegra 3 Processor, Android 4.1, I was keen on giving Google and ASUS' most recent effort a short.  The tablets I've owned that I could compare this one to included theHP TouchPad Wi-Fi 32 GB 9.7-Inch Tablet Computer, the original Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1,Apple iPad MD366LL/A (16GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, Black) 3rd Generation,ASUS Transformer TF300 T-B1-BL 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Blue)(with matching dock), the aforementioned Nexus 7,Google Nexus 10 (Wi-Fi only, 16 GB), and myMicrosoft Surface (32GB).  The Nexus 7 has turned out to be a worthy addition to this collection.  Here's why.PROS+ Lightweight build.  Last year's Nexus 7 was hardly a slouch in this department, and was more than portable enough for most.  The iPad Mini (which I purchased as a gift) is slightly thinner, but it doesn't really make any drastic improvements.  This device is markedly lighter than both, which makes it surprisingly easier in the hands.  You wouldn't think there was much room for improvement here (given the first generation was quite nice), but ASUS managed to pull it off.+ Great, understated looks.  Sure, the top and bottom bezels are a little larger, but compared to last year's Nexus 7, this device has a lot more ""class"" to it.  The exterior bezels now lack the bright silver banding, which helps the screen melt away into the bezels.  That's all the better, since as an LCD panel (which won't achieve the same black-levels as a AMOLED display from Samsung) is the centerpiece of this device, it's best to keep your focus on it.  The back is nice and smooth, with the word ""NEXUS"" inscribed into the back.  The branding is non-obtrusive and otherwise non-existent on a device that all around has a sophisticated, matte look to it.+ Powerful performance.  Without getting into too much technical information, the processor in this device (a rebranded Qualcomm Snapdragon 600) is significantly more powerful than the Nexus 7's Tegra 3 in every way.  It's also more power efficient, so you can watch your movies and games for longer, all while enjoying stunning looks.  Which brings me to the next two points...+ Beautiful screen.  This is a Full HD (1080p) panel in a 7"" package.  The best effort prior to this was Amazon's own Kindle Fire HD 8.9, which had a 1080p panel as well.  At present, this device has the sharpest screen (in terms of PPI) of any device, even compared against Apple's iPad 3 and Samsung's Nexus 10.  Colors are sharp and vivid and the screen has no motion blurring or ghosting.  My unit also doesn't have any light bleed, although I've seen some people complaining about it.+ Better hardware for longevity.  You may have heard of the recent kerfuffles around last year's Nexus 7, which has started to slow down and lag for many users.  The problem lay in how the device managed its onboard storage-- which, to put it mildly, was poor.  If you didn't mind tinkering and rooting your device, you could fix the issue, but that should never be a requirement in a consumer product.  Luckily enough, the refresh's hardware boasts better memory and Android 4.3 will automatically keep things in good shape, so you won't have to worry about this.+ Sound is pretty good for a small device.  It gets plenty loud without much distortion.  Unfortunately, ASUS elected to keep the speakers on the back for some unknown reason (especially with nice bezels on the top and bottom that could have provided stereo in landscape-- which is where you'd need those speakers most).  This is especially perplexing considering how well-reviewed the speakers on the Nexus 10 and HTC One were-- both packed front-facing stereo speakers.+ Android 4.3 under the hood means you've got a faster, more secure mobile experience than any previous version.  Even if you're primarily an iOS user, the Nexus 7 is definitely worth a look.  The Play Store's got almost all the heavy hitters you'd use on a tablet (such as Amazon Kindle, Netflix, a YouTube experience second to none, and the full power of Google's own services as an example), as well as some amazing Android-exclusive apps (such as Press, a beautiful RSS reader for those who prefer to take their news this way).  Many people have griped in the past about Android and tablet apps, but...+ You'll also find a mature and solid ecosystem waiting for you.  As a 7"" device, the refreshed Nexus 7 sits between traditional 10""-class tablets and the smartphone, meaning it can use apps designed for either very well.  Although most Android apps are still designed for phones, they scale up very well on the Nexus 7 (nothing like Apple's frankly laughable 2x zoom mode available on the iPad/iPad Mini).  Android tablet apps are also getting better by the day, so unless there really is that one killer app you can't leave behind, give it a whirl!+ Android 4.3 also provides multiuser support, so if you have this tablet in any social settings (having friends over, throwing a party, and so on), you can easily set up a guest profile for friends to use while keeping your own stuff under lock and key.  It's also great as a family tablet-- share the device among multiple members while keeping everyone's stuff separate.  Things have also gotten a lot faster since the 4.2 days, so if you had any issues before, give it another go.+ Notification light!  Hoorah!  Long-time Android users will instantly recognize how useful these things are, and as a casual device to leave lying around your desk, the light makes things much better.  Let's say you're walking by a coffee table and you receive an e-mail.  With an iOS device, the screen will light up for a few seconds, and a pulsing icon will let you know that you've got a message of some sort.  And both iOS and Android handsets without a light (such as last year's Nexus 7) will beep or produce a tone to let you know the same.  But if you happen to walk by after those time out, you'd never know that you have something waiting for you.  With a notification light, you get a persistent, unobtrusive and instantly-visible way of seeing that something's waiting.+ Great battery life.  Although the battery's smaller than last year's Nexus 7 (probably to slim down the build), Android 4.3 and the newer Snapdragon processor make for quite a powerful (hehe) package that will run all day and then some without trouble.  I have yet to charge mine after receiving it two days back, and I'm still looking at 50% remaining after heavy use.Of course, this isn't all sunshine and daisies.  Make sure you're making an informed purchase.  Here are some cons I've noticed.CONS- The cameras are forgettable.  Good enough for video calling, but it won't even replace most smartphone cameras.- I'm having screen lift issues in the upper left hand-hand side of my tablet, which means the back creaks a little if I press on it.  It doesn't impact functionality at all, and hopefully it may go away after a while, but my launch-day 8GB Nexus 7 from last year also had this issue.  needless to say, I'm a little annoyed that they weren't more rigorous this time around.  Not something you should have to deal with as a consumer.- Top and bottom bezels make the device a little larger than it has to be.  Depending on how you use this device, it could actually be a major pro for you (as wider bezels give you a better surface to grip without accidentally touching the screen).  For me, it's a definite con, since I think it makes the device look a tad silly.- Slightly less grippy than last year's model.  The refresh loses the dimpled texture of the original, which makes it a little more ""slick"" in the hand.  It's not awful by any means, but do keep in mind that it can slide a little more on surface than you'd expect.- The buttons.  Are maddening.  They're basically flush with the chassis, and while there's solid feedback on all three (power, volume up, volume down), they're very close to one another and feel exactly the same.  Expect to hit volume up a lot trying to wake this device up.All in all, I'd say buy this one with confidence.  It's well worth the upgrade if you're on the fence, and if you're new to the Android tablet land, this is an amazing place to start.  As a Nexus device, it'll get long software support and fast upgrades, so you'll always be getting the latest and greatest.  Questions?  Let me know in the comments below!

B00A3YN0Z0,electronics,Are these reviews genuine to follow?,"To be fair, this product has good and bad qualities...ADVANTAGES.1. It is very easy to install..2. When you call the company tech department, a knowledgeable English speaking person answers the phone..3. For customers who work during the day, the company has a tech person answering phones until 10 PM...DISADVANTAGES.1. A Chinese-made counterpart can be purchased at half the price. . . . On this matter, this is not a sin. Companies buy products from other firms, put their labels on them, and sell the items at a higher price. For example, GM's Matrix was really a Toyota Corolla..2. The router has reliability problems. My first lasted 11 months. Because it was under warranty, the company shipped me a replacement. The device lasted only two months..3. In April 2014, a one-star review of this router received the highest number of ""helpful votes."" Fearing a possible decline in sales, the company's lawyer threaten to sue the reviewer if he failed to delete his evaluation. The incident touched off a firestorm. News of the incident exploded on the internet, and a huge number of irate consumers inundated the Amazon website with negative reviews on the Medialink router..This is very troubling. In a free economy, products live or die by their usefulness, reliability, and value. An informed consumer decision to buy or not to buy is determined by previous user experiences with these qualities via the product reviews. When a company threatens ""to stack the market in its favor"" by misusing the legal system to suppress a critique of its wares, the firm violates the true essence of a competitive economic system - let the market decide. In other words, allow the buyers the freedom to read the reviews - good and bad - to help them make their decisions to buy..On this matter, Mediabridge should have ignored the ranting of one person.

I was disappointed to find that Belkin (or DeviceWear) hasn't got a Snap Shield type back for the Mini. However, in looking for those products, this case kept coming up as a decent, well reviewed case that seemed to offer what I was looking for.The case itself is cheaply made, but is light and fits the iPad Mini well. I actually really like the back portion - the cutouts are well placed and that part is good looking.As for the cover: The on/off feature works and even though the cover is stiff and not as nice as a real Smart Cover, I could have lived with that. The cover doesn't lie perfectly flat, but I could live with that. What I can't live with is that this case will not function as a stand. You can fold the cover into a triangle, but there are no magnets to keep the triangle together. Without those, the iPad might remain upright for a 4 or 5 seconds before it collapses. I can't believe that didn't put anything in there to support the triangular cover. In fact, if they would have included another magnet in the back of the case, they could have made a very sturdy and reliable stand that would have made this a great value.Today, I returned this case and  got a ""real"" iPad Mini Smart Cover from Apple and even though it is overpriced, the stand functionality is solid. I feel confident when I roll up the cover to make the triangle, it's not going anywhere. Additionally, the quality of the cover is much nicer and feels much more comfortable folded back behind the iPad. I appreciate these things, but would have been happy with the Poetic case, if they would have only added something to make the stand work.

B004T9RR6I,electronics,How is the unit?,"(See bottom for update )I have a wired network at the house. We've tried wireless in the past, but the signal won't penetrate the walls (they are 1 "" thick concrete boards). The last try was a few years back, and we really needed to try again. Every piece of electronics we buy has a network connection. I'm tired of running cables, installing hubs, etc.  Xbox, Wii, TV's, BluRay layers, satellite boxes, printers - the list goes on. And so do the network cables.OK, I did have some install issues and had to contact customer support, so this goes on a bit.  Bottom line, after all was said and done, this thing works FANTASTIC. There is one serious security concern - the router automatically had a wide open guest connection. You can't configure this during setup, but have to do it later. ASAP change this - set a password!  Had I not had my install issue, the install would have taken under 10 minutes. On to the review....I'm typing this review as I install the router: Default setup requires that you already have a wireless connection - that's a pretty silly assumption, since you're buying a wireless router. You don't find this out until you start installation. The instructions have you plug in the router, attach it to the internet (to the back of your cable box, etc.)  - then test for a wireless connection. If it does not find a connection, you have to redo step one, move the router next to your PC, unplug your PC from the network, and plug the router into your PC and the web. OK, so I climbed the ladder, pulled the router down from the shelf I stuck it on, and plugged it into the back of my PC with a 100' cable I had on hand.  Followed the instructions on the rest of the setup screen. It's the typical wizard interface, just follow instructions and press ""Next."" So I kept pressing ""Next."" After about three minutes I received a message - Big and bold - ""Our Customer Support team can help"" - then about 70% smaller - ""Your router was not successfully set up.""  You're then pointed to a website for help and chat. Chat. No phone number. OK, so now I need to unplug the router from the back of my PC, reattach my network cable, and visit the website. If you're like me, the computer is under your desk, pretty buried.  It's a real pain to crawl under there and swap cables. Plus you have to clean up all the stuff that missed your trash can.....OK, I follow the link. It's not a help page. It's the promo page for the product. So I have to find support myself. I find live chat. Have to fill out a short form?!  Took about two minutes to start the chat. Typical BS chat questions, asking me everything I just answered on the form I had to fill out to start the chat! Man is that annoying. Plus they want the serial number. They won't even chat without that information. Obvious from the grammar that I'm chatting with a tech-center in the Far-East. Then they want to know how many computers I have and the OS. So I tell them. Then I'm asked which computer was used to install the router. That's the first pertinent question. There's also the annoying 10-20 second gap between my sending an answer and the reply.Next: Do I use DSL and who is my ISP.  Still no question about the error.  Getting really annoyed. No, I do not use DSL. Business class broadband, five dedicated IP addresses.I'm told to (cut and paste - all replies are cut and paste, including typos):1. Reset the router, press and hold the reset button found underneath the router for 5-10 seconds (until the port lights flash at the same time) to reset the router to its factory defaults.2. Temporarily disable the Firewall or Anti-virus on the computer then Run the software. Make sure that the Ethernet Cable from the modem is connected to the Internet port of the router.OK - no reset button on the bottom of the router. Follow her instructions, but I point out that I don't have a wireless connection on my PC.  I'm told I don't need one.Reset router, disable firewall and antivirus.  Install fails. ""This computer does not appear to have wireless capability""I inform the tech. The reply? ""If this computer is not wireless then it needs to be wired to the router.""  I told her this before we started.  I feel like throwing something. Like the router.I get a reply: ""We can't proceed with the installation if the router is not yet connected to your modem and this computer is not wired to one of its nummbered ports.""My reply: Are you saying I have to have the router connected to the modem and my computer to the router? The router is over 100 feet away from my computer.Answer: ""The router needs to be plugged to your modem to work.""My reply: In other words, yes. So I need to either move a computer, move the modem, or run 100 feet of cable, right?Long delay - two minutes and counting.....three minutesAnswer: ""Yes""In other words, there was no reason to deactivate the Antivirus and Firewall. And the chat was a complete waste of time. They never asked about the error, just followed a preset script/decision tree, and wasted my time.So no wireless on your PC? You need to connect your PC to the router and the router to the web, you may have some rearranging to do. Fortunately I had that extra cat 5, 100' cable. Why require wireless already be in place? This is idiotic. Bottom line: The Reset on the router was all that was needed. Install now worked.User name and password entered, updated detected and installed. Update took four minutes. Router is installed. Now to try it out! Get rid of that 100' cable, connect my PC to the network again.Well, not so fast. It appears that my PC needs a wireless card to connect directly to the router. It's setup, it's on my network - and I need to use a wireless connection to configure it? Come on!!! Look, not every PC in an office or house is going to be wireless. My configuration/final goal - replace my hubs with wireless hubs, keeping the wired connections to the computers and devices (printers, BluRay players, TV's, etc.) The only wireless devices will be Kindles and a couple of laptops.  So I have to use a wireless device to configure the router. Pathetic.Hmmm. What to do.  Open up my DroidX, download the Cisco Connect Express App, and try that.  While that was going on, I ran the WiFi analyzer app and checked the signal strength throughout the house. Wow! It's strong everywhere. Back of the house, basement, outside. But - Woah! There are two network connections available from the router - a secured connection, and a wide-open guest connection! Gotta turn that off - but I can't connect to the router. Let's try that Droid app. I turned off WiFi to save the battery... Run the app. It requires WiFi (duh) but it can't turn it on for you. So exit the app, turn on WiFi. Try and find the app. It's not under Cisco. It's not under Router. It's called simply ""Express"" - no common sense with these people! So I run the app.""Router not found.""  My kindle finds it. The DroidX finds it. The Cisco app on the DroidX can't find it. Appears that you need to manually connect to the network, then run the app. Sheesh. So I check the connections. Hey, I AM connected to the guest connection. Let's switch to the secure connection. Man, time to pay for that 25 character long, upper/lower/numeric combination I set for a password.... Connected to the secure connection. Run the Cisco app again. It asks for the admin password. Enter password. Connected. So the error message was misleading. It should have stated that a secure connection was required.Once the app runs we see:Four options: Guest Access - Wi-Fi settings - Devices - Router ManagementChange the guest settings: Require a password, set max guests. Can't set lower than 4, so I make it 4.WiFi settings: Only allows you to change name and password.Devices:Display connected devices - a list of connected devicesManually add a device - displays the router info - Name, password, securityUse WiFi protected setup - tells you how to use the protected setup button found on some devicesRouter management:Renew IP address - renews IP, asks again when you press the optionReboot - Reboots, asks again when you press the optionFirmware update - Checks for update.Router details - All router info (model #, serial #, IP address, etc.)Hardware: runs a little hot, no way of wall mounting, looks cool and sleek.Included: Cat 5 cable, 6' - Power adapter, router, install CD.Update 4-27-12: Added aTRENDnet 300 Mbps Wireless N 4-Port Media Bridge TEW-640MB (Piano Black)to my network. This bridge has the WPS button, as does the Linksys router. Connecting the two was darn right simple. I pressed the WPS button on the bridge, and used my Droid App to access the EA4500 - pressed the WPS button on the screen. A minute later, I had a secure connection.  Attached two PC's and two printers. Checked the app again - saw all the devices connected.  At first I did not like the idea of using a wireless device to control the EA4500. But, wow, is this handy! I'm crawling around under the desk, Droid in hand, controlling the EA4500, linking to the bridge.  Did the same thing with a webcam.  Love the wireless app!  Just under a month later I returned the Trendnet Media Bridge. Kept dropping the connection, slowinf down - a real pain - and it was located within sight of the router.  Picked up a Netgear bridge instead - works flawlessly.  I'm bandwidth - so I also picked up a Netgear N900 USB wireless adapter.  I constantly get 450 mbps - this is in addition to the connection through the bridge.  I have two simultaneous connections, both wireless. Hitting 550 mbps total.Another update: I had to reset the router. The software that you installed to setup the router will NOT run. You get an error that you reset the router, and that you need to install the software again. WHAT? What if you can't find the CD?  I have never heard of anything this stupid. That cost it a star.

B004T9RR6I,electronics,How much control does the camera give you?,"UPDATE (26 June 2012):I got ready to add a USB storage device (Seagate 2TB) to the router and when I launched the router page I was presented with a new screen and asked to create an account for Cisco Connect Cloud.  I created the account and was presented with a new way to manage my router.  The new way has a new (and improved) management screen that makes it easy to manage, it takes some time to get used to, but it is very user friendly (I am used to the more technical way, so I have to look closer through the options to find most stuff).  The system is nice since you can access it from different computers without using your home network.  You can now use neat apps to limit the network (like content and media and protect your network), most apps are advertised and some are available for Android, but most say coming soon for iPhone.  Some look promising and the new system is neat.  I look forward to the improved version for iPhone (over Cisco Connect Home). -- One thing to point out, the Cisco Cloud will log you out if you do not stay active (kind of bad for your own router...), but the device list customization is nice and you can add custom names and images for each item (to easily recognize suspicious devices.The iPhone app is also available in the Apple App Store and is a small install.  Once I logged in (with the account I created when I launched the router page), from the app you can see the status of your network (is it connected to internet, who [what devices] are connected), you can also edit most parts of the router settings (not the more advanced stuff, like the QoS, Gaming, and Internet settings), but you can edit passwords, wireless names and passwords, and guest access.  Pretty neat, and it will be fun to see what other apps become available that make this even better.I also wanted to add that when I tried to add my USB Storage device, I ran into trouble.  I had the drive formatted in exFAT (I did not want the 4GB file size limitation of FAT 32 nor a specific to Windows or Mac (since I use both)).  I plugged in the drive and the Cloud Connect did not recognize it.  I contacted support and they informed me that the router only supports: FAT32, NTFS and HFS+ formats.  So, I wanted to let you all know, just in case you try to use it with a LINUX formatted or exFAT formatted drive.  I am going to format it into NTFS and use the network only to connect to it from my Mac.  Once it was formatted for NTFS, the Cisco Connect Cloud recognized it instantly.  The settings were easy to understand and there were easy options to setup FTP settings for accessing files over the internet (I did not want this, since I just wanted to share the drive on the local network).  When I opened Finder on my Mac I could get to my drive over the router name in Shared section.  The USB storage section also included addresses to access your storage drive.I was excited to see this router after seeing the online push and emails that Cisco has sent out advertising there new Router with Apps.  I was curious on what they would utilize with the Apps.  Since my E4200v2 and E2000 both support the Cisco Connect Express app from my iPhone.  Apparently the big app, that is what all the buzz is about is the Cisco Connect Cloud.  I looked around for it, and it is not advertised on the box or on many sites, so I finally found it on the Cisco website, but it apparently will not be available until the Summer (I always believe that stuff should not be released until all the features are available, with apps and cloud based services this type of delay has become quite prominent). So I cannot use the main new feature until later...  Cisco says once it is available the Cisco Connect app/software will alert me.  As soon as it is available I will definitely try it out, but I have a fear with that high amount of Upstream traffic will slow my network down (I have AT&T; DSL), so I am curious about it, and will update my review when it is available.Now for the router itself:Like I said, I am updating from a Linksys E4200v2 to the Linksys EA4500.  So far there is no difference.  They have the exact specs (from what I see), just the new one has app enabled (for an app that is not out yet...)So Since they are near identical routers, installation was similar.  I never like using the install CDs, since I do not want there software on my computers.  So I plugged into the router using a network cable, and went to the router's home page (192.168.1.1).  The default setting is username: admin, password: admin.  I then from the main page set up my DSL connection, so since I have AT&T; DSL, I selected PPPoE, then inserted my att email and then my password (provided by your DSL provider), it is a different approach for Cable Internet (MAC Cloning is the easiest), although if you are not sure how to do this you might want to go with the software, I am familiar with setting up networks, so it is easier to do it manually.  Set your routers IP here, and the range of addresses for leasing (you can just use the default, unless you need more than 50 devices, then change it accordingly).I then went to the Wireless tab and set up Manual WiFi settings, I like broadcasting on the 2.4 and 5GHz so I can manually connect my 5GHz devices to this network and my 2.4GHz to there network (although 2.4GHz devices cannot see the 5GHz broadcast).  I gave each network a recognizable name for my network, and then used WPA-2 Personal for encryption, make sure to use at least two combinations (numbers + letters or + symbols), it makes brute force attacks nearly impossible due to time required (I use letters + numbers + symbols).\I then set up the Guest Access (which can be done from the web interface, this was not possible on the E2000s), I gave it a name and a password and limited it to 5 guests.  Guest access creates a network separate from your main network, different IP address group for the two (for example my home is 192.168.1.XXX, and my guest is 192.168.3.XXX), this way guest cannot see my machines on my main network.  A neat feature when relatives come over.I then went over to Quality of Service and set my Media Center, Roku 2, and Skype Applications as High Priority to ensure that they work properly even if I have a lot of activity on other devices.I also went into the DHCP Reservation (Home page toward bottom), and gave my Printer a Static IP address.  To do this go to DHCP and then if you see your printer in the list check the box next to it and hit Add, then give it a name and Static address.  You then need to tell the printer to use that Static IP (this ensures proper behavior).  If you do not see your item yet in the Client list, you can get your MAC address from the device (make sure to get Wireless if you plan to connect wirelessly or Wired if you plan to connect over Wire (they are different MAC addresses, even in the same machine! [Separate network devices]).  Then in the DHCP Client type in a name, your preferred IP address and then the MAC address.  I do this for printers to ensure that computers that connect to it using its IP address stay connected even if the network reboots and issues out new IP addresses (it takes a little extra time, but is worth it to ensure devices like Printers stay active on the network).This device can have USB HDD and USB Printer plugged in to serve as a file or print server.  This is great for people who have older USB printers and want to share it across the network without keeping a PC running all the time just to host it.  The file sharing is also nice for large USB HDD that you want access to over the network.In the end this is a great router, has some great features and is easy to install and monitor (whether you use the Cisco Connect or the Web Interface), I look forward to playing with the Cisco Connect Cloud (and wish that when devices come out that their new features were available at release), but in the end if you need a router able to handle larger networks, and high entense applications (I canceled Satellite for Internet Streaming and Off Air broadcasting (HD HomeRun to Media Center Computer with Hulu Desktop) and Roku 2, and canceled home phone for a Skype subscription.  Therefore, I need a router that can handle this type of network activity, and these routers (EA4500, E4200v2) have worked perfectly and never have any problem keeping my network live!

B004QK7HI8,electronics,How many products have been stolen?,"So I decided a few months back that I wanted to get rid of cable at my house and just stream Netflix and Hulu Plus, but was worried about local channels.

B0074BW614,electronics,Is the option available?,"First, let me say that I am an avid Kindle user and have been from the days of Kindle 1. Over the years since the first Kindle, I have purchased vast quantities of Kindle books. Currently, I own 5 Kindles (6 with the Fire HD). They are: the Kindle 1 (by far the best display of all the later e-ink kindles with an SD card slot and a user replaceable battery, which later editions omitted), returned a Kindle 2 for display issues, kept a Kindle 3 (Keyboard), own 2 Kindle touches, the original Fire, and now the Fire HD. All are used by my family. So when I ordered the KF-HD it was with high expectations of really wanting to love this thing. I use the original Fire all the time and love it. Here's what I found about the new Kindle Fire HD:Out of the box the hardware is impressive to say the least, and having used it extensively since receiving it, I find it this Kindle has too many problems to justify keeping the unit until they fix some MAJOR engineering mistakes and software inadequacies that are embarrassingly idiotic. The first Kindle Fire works great. This one, well, leaves much to be desired. Here are the Pros and Cons, as I have experienced them:Pros:1. Fantastic sound with the Dolby turned on. If this feature is off, the speakers sound worse than the original Kindle Fire. You can get this same sound on the original Kindle Fire using good external speakers or a good set of headphones.2. Whispersync with Voice (concurrent with a very big con, see below).3. Text to Speech.4. Very crisp and clear display (with a concurrent con, see below).Cons:1. The HD video display when viewing videos is either slightly on the orange to green side for skin tones (as compared to the original KF). The original Kindle Fire had much more realistic flesh tones on videos. All videos, at least in my opinion.2. The power cable attaches to the side of the unit, rather than at the top or bottom, making it impossible to charge and watch or read anything in landscape mode while charging. This is a major inconvenience. Given a choice between an HDMI cable output and a charging indicator, give me a charging indicator and let the Cloud do its job so it's unnecessary to plug in the Fire to a TV.3. No charging indicator light. How basic is this?? All other Kindle's have indicator lights! Was this an oversight? Or,engineering stupidity at it's best...you decide.4. Power switch and volume control are flush with the casing, impossible to see and/or find in the dark-unless you turn the unit on its side and push til you find a switch.5. Consistently has problems connecting with a wireless connection, giving the error of ""authentication failure"", making it necessary to connect using the ""Settings, Wireless, Connect"" from the settings menu (works fine after that).6. Whispersync for Voice and Audible.com do not communicate well at all! I bought several books (free) with free associated audio books from audible.com. What a nightmare! Audible.com does not automatically link your Amazon account, and when it does, it picks the first 3 devices to use on your account there. If the first 3 do not list your kindle fire HD, you cannot download the books wirelessly to your device from Amazon's Manage Your Kindle page or Audible.com's My Library page. Further, unless you deregister your device and then re-register it, you cannot change the order of the availability of your devices. However, when you do download the book and follow the link for ""professional narration"", it will link in for a purchase. You must then open your book in the Kindle Fire HD, and touch the bottom of the screen on the Chapter 1 page (beginning of book) for it to first download a sample audio, and then the purchased audio from Audible.com. MAJOR HASSLE. Without seamless integration of these two services, Kindle books and Audible.com, it becomes a big frustration very quickly. Did I mention that Audible.com charges $14.95 PER MONTH for membership? Not user friendly in a recession/depression environment! How about a ""no strings attached"" membership? Finally, Audible.com only permits 3 Kindle devices to be on your account. For my household, with 6 Kindles, this doesn't beget customer satisfaction, or a desire to become a member of Audible.com.Additionally, some of the free books linked to Whispersync for Voice I had previously purchased. Unfortunately, those editions would not link to Whispersync for Voice, meaning I had to re-purchase (albeit free) the book (different edition) to link to and then purchase (again with a free promotion) the audio book from Audible.com. For a paid version of a Kindle book that also has an audible version available but no link to Whispersync (those links are listed on the book product page) means you have to use a particular Kindle book with the particular companion Audible.com audible book. Bummer.7. Ads. Ads. Ads. For $199 I expect an Ad-free environment. Not here! You have to ""opt-out"" for an additional charge ($15). BAD MOVE for Amazon. Even then, once you opt-out, the continual ""suggestions"" are annoying and intrusive to the extreme. This does not exist on the original Kindle Fire.8. No SD card slot, a continuing Amazon deficiency (especially when dealing with content when you are out of Wi-Fi range), and no user replaceable battery. This is where my Kindle 1 shines. I keep categories of books on different SD cards because (obviously) the drive in K1 is inadequate to the task of taking my entire library along. The Kindle Keyboard (4 GB storage) houses my complete library, but not the Kindle Touch (2GB storage). You may ask, why is this important with the cloud drive available? Because ever since Amazon ripped my paid-for copy of George Orwell's 1984 off my Kindle without my permission, I do not trust my purchased content exclusively to Amazon's cloud drive. I back it up immediately to the computer.9. No Favorites section below the Carousel without going through the ""Favorites"" Star icon. Great when you can find it, annoying when you can't.10. Inconsistent displays on the Carousel. Not all items are displayed, they mysteriously disappear and reappear. When you tap them to open sometimes they do, and other times they just shake in place without opening. Other times, when trying to remove them from the Carousel, once you ""tap and hold"", the concurrent menu allowing you to remove the item from the device, the carousel or add/remove from Favorites does not appear at all. The ""shimmy"" effect of a vibrating icon on the Carousel is very disturbing (at least to me), making me wonder if it's trying to crash (aka a computer crash).12. No YouTube. No YouTube app that works.13. Email display is horrific both in portrait and landscape modes. Once an email is opened you have to scroll to read side-to-side, with a column list of your emails on the left (in landscape mode) which cannot be changed.14. Android Apps for Kindle Fire purchased for the original Kindle Fire may or may not (mostly not) work on the new Kindle Fire HD. When I asked about this, Customer Service told me they were ""working on it."" Right out of the box this is inexcusable. It's like saying, ""You can't have all your Kindle books which you purchased on this device because it is not going to work yet for those items"".15. Huge screen glare problem. Just gotta love seeing my face and the room around me while doing anything with this Kindle! The ""anti-glare screen protector"" recommended by Amazon is anything but anti-glare, and (conveniently) no other anti-glare screen protectors offered will fit the KFHD.16. The ""recommended"" case by Amazon only allows the KF to be installed one way and the display to face one way when using the stand, so you can't watch a movie even if you flip it over to view a movie in landscape mode while charging. Unfortunately, due to the location of the power cable (when plugged in), this makes it impossible to watch a movie using the case as a stand while the power cord is plugged in. The stand use of the case is unstable. If you read in bed, as I do, I find this to be a massive problem. The RooCase for the Original Kindle Fire accomplished both tasks for the original KF nicely.17. Camera only works with Skype (and Facebook with a lot of fiddling with an app to make it happen).My advice is PASS ON THIS PURCHASE. WAIT FOR KINDLE FIRE HD 3. Mine is going back, and I would advise anyone wanting a Kindle Fire to buy a refurbished original KF from Amazon (if any) or go to eBay. This one is too expensive and too buggy--perhaps released too quickly before fixing engineering and software glitches. For me, the Cons far outweighed the Pros to the point that this device is not for me. Hopefully my observations will help someone in their purchase decision. I really did want to keep this device; however, given the financial times and the inherent problems I have experienced with the KFHD, it is not worth the effort if you already have a Kindle Fire Original.Finally, given the above, I could not also justify buying an 8.9"" screen for the larger KFHD either. Buy an iPad instead if you want a bigger screen and easy email handling (yes, I have and use an iPad).For the convenience, I hope one day Amazon adds Text to Speech to the original KF, but til then my Kindle Keyboard keeps on keepin' on. Fine for me. The newer editions are (for me) a waste of time and money.REVIEW UPDATE:Even though I sent mine back, I decided to try one more time because I got a new one as gift. Because of continuing hardware problems, I am now on my 5th return of this item to Amazon (LOVE their customer service) by their request. KFHD #6 still has issues which cannot be resolved.NOTE WELL: MY REVIEW IS A COMPARISON OF THE NEW KFHD TO THE 1ST GEN KINDLE FIRE ONLY. Several comments to my review have been rude and mean, which has kept me from updating this review until now (Jan 2013).My 6th KFHD has solved the video color problem very well, but the previous 1,2,3,4,5 ones had speakers blow out when connected to a bluetooth device (ipod classic and an ipod touch). Bummer. I have not connected this one to a bluetooth speaker (Bose), nor will I in the future.STILL have email problems. Started using the paid email app which approximates the display of the amazon email app on the original KF. However, my ISP uses a Barracuda Spam Firewall Filter that sends an email for me to connect to my quarantined inbox to check if any emails need to go to the inbox rather than the quarantine box. The Barracuda link goes to a web page, but the web page only loads half-way and will NOT allow me to access the quarantine inbox. The old KF had no problem with this. None. The new one does not allow this function. AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE HAS ADMITTED THAT THIS IS A BROWSER GLITCH ON THEIR PART AND THEY HAVE NO INTENTION OF FIXING IT. 3 customer service agents have told me it is a known issue that Amazon will NOT solve. End of discussion. So if your ISP uses Barracuda, BEWARE.AS COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL FIRE, THIS ONE IS STILL A DISAPPOINTMENT for me. As for you, only you can decide.

I really don't see that as a major CON though, perhaps more of a description to give someone a better mental view without having a picture to directly compare (I did take pictures but its really hard to compare the Mediabridge to the stock as the size difference isn't a huge thing, but the way the Mediabridge cable feels makes me want it instead.).

B005DKZTMG,electronics,How did you like the device?,"The class is wireless RF keyboards with touchpads, which have media keys, and are relatively compact, yet usable for extended typing, and which are not prohibitively expensive. It's a surprisingly limited class, given current trends in home theaters and media consumption. I've listed another contender, below.First, note that I have the white K400R. The R indicates the updated keyboard, with some reprogrammable features, and which has volume controls on the F10-F12 keys. The older K400 has volume controls on the hotkey buttons, above. At this writing, Amazon offers either black or white versions of the keyboard, BUT, the black one is the K400, and the white one is the K400R.The keyboard layout is not full-sized. It's just a bit larger than the one on my Asus EeePC netbook. I have no problem with this size, though some users may find it too small. Some have complained about the stretch required to get to the right shift key. While it IS a stretch, the smaller overall size of the keyboard makes the stretch not as bad as it may appear. Keystroke feel is pretty good. Build quality is pretty good. You get some minor creaks when picking it up in various ways, but, picking it up with one hand -- thumb under the touchpad -- is solid enough.For me, a keyboard that lacks dedicated Page Up, Page Down, Home and End keys is a non-starter. For that reason, I had always avoided the K400. I decided to give the K400R a try, when I learned that it is ""programmable."" Well, it is sort of programmable: 3 hotkey buttons (media player, PC lock, PC sleep) and 6 function keys (F1-F6) can be reconfigured with Logitech's downloadable Setpoint software. Note that the Home button can NOT be reassigned.I set up the F1 and F2 keys as Page Up and Page Down. The F3 and F4 keys became Home and End. To help identify their function, I put thin strips of colored electrical tape on the button risers (I'll try to add a photo). [Unfortunately, these new navigation keys do not work with the control or shift key, such as when selecting text.] I set F5 to be WMC toggle between full-screen and window mode. F6 is set to be quick skip (aka skip ahead, aka ad skip).When Googling for keystrokes necessary to program F5 and F6, I discovered two things about Windows Media Center. 1) There are keyboard shortcuts available for all operations we might want to accomplish with dedicated media keys. Nice. You could actually live without a ""media keyboard,"" if you don't mind using the control- and alt- shifted keystrokes. 2) The quick skip interval can be modified with the skipaheadinterval registry setting (exercise caution; and, Google for full instructions). Instead of the default 30 seconds, skipping ads in recorded programs might be easier if set to skip 60 seconds, or even 3 minutes.The next issue some people have expressed with this keyboard is that the FN key must be pressed to get regular F1-F12 keystokes, since the media and windows functions have been set for non-FN priority. Fortunately, this can be reversed in Setpoint. BTW, Setpoint may not immediately offer configuration options on new setups. It seems you must first use the software to unpair and then re-establish connection (using another keyboard or mouse), before all options are shown.In spite of my tendency to frequently use the F5 and F11 keys, I decided to maintain priority for the media keys. To avoid having to FN shift for F5 and F11, I set the PC lock and PC sleep buttons to provide those functions.The touchpad has a good feel for general use and 2-finger scroll. Pinch-zoom works, but, I've never had that before, so can't compare feel.There are 2 significant problems with the touchpad, which I have decided to live with. They are known issues, as they have appeared in problem reports on the Logitech support forum. 1) The 2-finger right-click often does not work. It appears to vary depending on window focus, or use of 2-finger scroll. It's so bad, I'd rather use my thumb on the right mouse button, below the touchpad. 2) While double-tap-drag does work for some things, like moving a window by the title bar, it does NOT work to resize a window. Resizing becomes a 2-hand operation, though the left mouse button on the top left corner makes it less awkward than if using the touchpad's left button.Some users might find happiness with the Ortek WKB-2000, currently listed on Amazon as ""2.4GHz RF Wireless Keyboard with Smart Touchpad Mouse for MCE Media Center Edition"". I could not get the 2-finger scroll to work. From reading reviews, and through my own efforts, I discovered there is no good driver for Windows 7, 64-bit.The best keyboard I've had is listed on Amazon as ""RK728 Wireless Keyboard"". Mine just died, and it was a great loss! Unfortunately, it is not currently available, even on the 'bay. That may be because of quality control problems. I knew mine would not last forever, and had tried twice to buy a backup. But, both failed in a few days, and were returned.Also noteworthy, is the Adesso WKB-4000UB. It has a great form factor, good key action, and is currently available, but, it has no media keys. Worse than that, the touchpad seems to be pretty low resolution, and, about half the time, tap to click does not register, so, I have to move the pointer slightly, and tap again. For that reason, I just use it as a backup. Mine is several years old, so, it is possible that the touchpad has been improved. Oh, and the touchpad has a scroll zone on the right edge, rather than 2-finger scroll.3 1/2 stars would be the best rating for the K400R. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5554, 5568)"

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,Is the option available?,"I guess setting up the Chromecast was not as a breeze as it was for most users. I simply couldn't set it up through chrome. I checked all the router settings as it was suggested by the installer, even reseted my router, but to no avail. After going though all forums and troubleshooting pages, I realized that the firewall on my Macbook Pro is on, and that's the reason. When I disabled the firewall, it was set up in no time.But things got better after that grueling installing experience. I have hooked the Chromecast up to my LG 39LN5300, and it works (almost) perfectly. I use it to watch youtube, Netflix, or to stream (some) online videos using VidCast bookmarklet. From time to time, it doesn't work, but a simple reload of the chrome page almost always solves the problem. I also tried tab-casting, but it's not something to write home about. You can cast The Daily Show, or Colbert Report, but it only runs (almost) smoothly at 480p, and it takes a lot of CPU and RAM (you can hear the fan on Macbook Pro going crazy). The good thing though is that it also casts the audio to the tv. To be fair, this option is still in beta version, so hopefully it will get better with time.What is exciting about Chromecast is that Google recently released the SDK for developers, and they are doing a great job coming up with cool ideas (check out AllCast, for instance).

I could connect over VPN through my iPhone to my home network. I was running the linksys with DD-WRT. I didn't find any need to do that to this router since it has a built-in bandwidth monitor and VPN. I also setup the built in FTP server and attached a small 16GB memory stick to it. The router supports two USB storage devices. Overall a very nice router and much better than anything Cisco has to offer at this price point.

B004J4VYG2,electronics,How is the but the directions were surprisingly?,"I used this for months before even thinking about writing a review, mostly because I didn't have all that much occasion to ""authentically"" use it. I can't, unfortunately, compare this to other brands of portable GPS, as my only other GPS experience has been with Honda's built-in system. If you have to have GPS, don't have a smart phone, and are unlikely to need this on-the-fly, I could recommend it. But not without reservation.The biggest problem I've had with it is that it takes FOREVER for the unit to acquire a signal when first turned on. It seems like the longer it's been off, the longer it takes to get a satellite signal, but I wouldn't swear to that. Sometimes, though, it takes ten or fifteen minutes, and if I'm actually trying to go somewhere, I very rarely have that long to wait.Once it does get the satellite, it works fairly well, though it's not super-intuitive. The touch screen isn't greatly accurate, but it works well enough. You definitely can't use it while you're driving, but, I mean, I guess you're not supposed to do that anyway.The maps are good and accurate, but the route is never the one I'd choose. This is true of all auto-mapping software, though, and just a problem with the genre.The screen is bright and easy to see, and the contrast changes automatically for day or night, which is nice. I can't figure out how to shut up the woman who gives the directions for more than a few minutes a time, which is the number one reason I've pretty much completely stopped using it.Again, most of these issues are with the genre itself, and this unit does perform well (other than the satellite thing), and seems reasonably priced for what you get. Recommended, but of course with these caveats. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1726, 1740)"

B00CL8F98W,electronics,How about view?,"Purchased one of these from a big-box store after considerable research comparing it to Dropcam, Foscam, and TRENDNet.  For the past two years we've been using a VueZone system, but recently upgraded to a 10Mb Internet connection so wanted to try a full-frame-rate IP camera with pan, tilt, and zoom capabilities.  The results were disappointing across the board:1. Poor depth-of-field.2. Smeared look to movement.3. Weak Wi-Fi reception.4. Slow response to pan, tilt, and zoom controls.5. Non-existent Tech Support6. Java requirement.Depth-of-Field--------------The image looked fuzzy at certain distances, so I placed it at the end of a 20' hallway and systematically adjusted the lens to find a focal point that would work for all distances near and far.  Never could.  Interestingly, our VueZone camera whose lens is non-adjustable has no difficulty keeping everything in focus.Smeared Movement----------------Compared to YouTube examples--and an understanding of how 30fps should look--our results disappointed.  They were certainly an improvement over the 4fps of our VueZone cameras, but not what 30fps should look like IMHO.  Looked somewhere between those two numbers.Weak Wi-Fi----------One of the big selling points of today's IP cameras is their use of Wi-Fi.  Surprisingly, this camera would not connect much beyond 15' and passing through one wall.  Found this surprising because our VueZone cameras sit 20' feet away and pass through two walls without problem.  One camera is 30' away and passes through three walls one of which is brick.  All the more surprising when you consider the DCS-5020L can act as a wireless extender.Slow Response-------------Pan, tilt, and zoom controls had a 2-4 second delay.  That's not horrible but borders on it.  Again, does not match what people post in YouTube reviews.Tech Support------------DLink has enjoyed a strong reputation for consumer tech products ever since its early success in routers.  So, I was surprised to learn their technical support consisted of FAQ pages on their web site.And, if you click on Contact Us you are taken to a content-management system where you type in your question and it does it's best to find an answer other owners have rated as ""helpful"" in the past.Pretty lame.  Again, using VueZone as our point of reference, at least with them you can call and talk to a person.Java Requirement----------------Simply put, if you use the myDlink web site to access your camera you gotta have Java enabled.  And, since 2011 Java is known to be one of the biggest malware vectors on the Net.  Apple quit shipping products with it pre-installed right after that announcement.Conclusion----------On the plus side, the camera is attractively designed, quiet when tilted or panned, and incorporates an IR-cut filter.  Unfortunately it fails in the critical areas of providing a clear image with reasonable Wi-Fi range.  For that and the reasons outlined above, it will be returned for a refund.  Next stop, Dropcam.

B0001FTVEK,electronics,How great it's the sound?,"When hubby was at work, I would often turn on a computer radio program to listen to while I did housework. Unfortunately, he was seriously injured at work almost 2 years ago. His sleep is erractic and pain makes the only place sleep is possible, is his recliner. Since I never know when he will be able to sleep, I stopped listening to the programs I had enjoyed, so it wouldn't bother him. My brother suggested I check out wireless headphones. He told me a very little bit, but mostly look for the kind that were wireless and not line of sigth, in other words the kind that could go through walls, ceilings, etc. So, I started researching and reading. I thought I would just pick up a pair at Best Buy or even Walmart. Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with out current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but only passing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2"" and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money. I would highly reccommend these to anyone. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5410, 5424)"

B000HCT12O,electronics,How was the feature?,"I have owned this mouse for 2 years now and have finally given up on it. It does have amazing features and an amazing grip but it still has flaws that render it useless for some.Reliability:2 years, dropped so many times and still works like the first day I got it. I think it's reliable enough and the finish is great, not a single scratch.Installation:Is straightforward. You can use the Windows built-in drivers (plug and play) and it will work straightaway. However, if you want to use the many features of the mouse you'll have to install Logitech SetPoint.Software:SetPoint is OK. It has it's bugs (in Vista x64 it would sometimes forget your settings on startup and you would need to double click the SetPoint taskbar icon for it to activate - an example is the wheel setting, being click-to-click or middle button). Older versions (I'm at 4.80) had problems in recognizing the mouse in Vista x64, this seems to have been solved from 4.xx.Features:Nevertheless it gives good flexibility in configuring the mouse. Which, in turn, comes with many features of which:- Configurable wheel (free to spin - or normal click-click-click), if you don't want a middle-button you can set it to shift between the two. Or you can even let SetPoint automatically decide based on your scrolling speed.- The wheel itself would act as left/right buttons if you push it to the sides. I never used this feature and as I don't find it easy. It's not very comfortable really.- 2 additional buttons on the side, and one in the middle just behind the wheel - configurable to whatever you like.- A 2nd wheel...ish thing.. It's useful to scroll through open windows.The mouse feels great in the hand and is quite comfortable but it may need to be elevated slightly higher than the normal position comfortable for the keyboard. This of course also depends on how big your hands are, mine are big.Tracking:Is great. Works fine on almost all surfaces I tried it on. You will hardly find a surface that this mouse doesn't track on.Speed:Not the best feature. 800 dpi and response (or refresh) rate is way low. I'm not sure if this is wireless lagging or because of the sensor itself but the mouse is SLOW so forget using it for fast action gaming. Seriously, forget it and go look somewhere else if you want this mouse for gaming. THAT, and add to it how HEAVY the mouse is, it WILL set you back in games.Wireless:Bad. It interferes with 2.4GHz wifi. I changed routers, changed channels, changed all kinds of settings in my wifi network and it still interferes like crazy. Of course this only happens when there is heavy load on the wireless network - like downloads or something. But you would expect better from Logitech. This is not acceptable.Because of speed and the wireless problems I finally gave up on it and purchased a wired habu (microsoft-razer). Yes, it's old but I got it for a good price and honestly I didn't know what I was missing. I didn't want to take another chance with Wireless for now (although another cheapo mouse I have has no issues with wifi whatsoever) and I wanted something lighter and faster (which wireless mice normally lack). And I'm very happy with it. Hence, I decided to finally come and write this review. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3224, 3238)"
B002DP1FTU,electronics,How is the detail?,"Sources: iPhone5 with PA2V2/FiiO E07k/Decware Zen Head amps using the LOD, various computers using the Microstreamer/Beyer A200p/v-moda Verza DAC/amps.Review notes: My first impressions of the sound of the SRH440 are based on direct comparisons to other headphones - the v-moda M80 and M100, the Beyerdynamic DT1350 and T51p, the FAD Pandora IV and VI, and notes I've accumulated from many prior reviews. I describe how I relate to the SRH440 (i.e. my personal tastes and how I use the headphone) only after covering all of the objective issues.Summary of sound: It's no coincidence that the SRH440 has such a good soundstage and sense of openness, since those properties are highly dependent on a neutral frequency response that's free of peaks, recesses, and colorations which derive mainly from undamped resonances.My first impression of the SRH440 is neutral sound. But it's much better than that. In my 80-odd headphone reviews, I've used expressions like &#34;fairly neutral&#34; or &#34;basically neutral&#34; etc., but the number of those that I'd play with no EQ whatever were very few: B&W; P7, Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro, FAD Pandora VI, Mad Dog, Sennheiser IE800, and the Shure SRH1840. Compared to those six, the SRH440 gets close to the Mad Dog and the IE800, and has a better signature I think than the other four. In the case of the P7 and Pandora VI, their responses are slightly more 'V'-shaped, but still fine for most genres as is. The Custom One Pro and the SRH1840 are a bit more bland, but also fine for most music genres. The SRH440's (understandable) limitation is its ultimate resolution - the most expensive headphones I've listed here have a subtly clearer sound that's noticeable in direct comparisons, but when the SRH440 is heard on its own, I doubt that very many users would hear the sound as any less than perfect.Some concerns I have with low-cost headphones are inconsistencies in matching the sound between the left and right drivers, and matching the sound between different production samples of the same headphone. When there are any such inconsistencies, a customer may experience a very different sound than what they were expecting based on reviews they've read. Although the SRH440 is only $99 USD currently, every indication I have is for a high quality well-made product. The limitations I notice most compared to the more expensive headphones are the fit and finish - the finish is plain and plastic, but elegant in its simplicity. The earcup fit doesn't feel as though it's making a good seal to my head, which is usually critical for proper bass response, but since the bass is just right anyway, the only issue with the fit is that it's not as luxurious as with the pricier headphones. The SRH440 earpads are quite good, and are a huge step up in quality from (for example) the Sennheiser HD280 Pro earpads.Earcup rotation is no more than a few degrees horizontally. Vertical rotation is 180 degrees, so from the earcup rotations I'd expect the SRH440 to fit a wide range of head sizes. My average-size head fits with the earcups pulled out to click stop no. 4, allowing a 3/4 inch smaller and 5/4 inch larger adjustment to the headband on each side. The long coiled cable is single-entry to the left earcup, and has a proprietary detachable locking connector with a 2.5 mm stereo plug (same as other Shure headphones). The cable is terminated with a standard 3.5 mm miniplug threaded for a 6.35 mm plug adapter (included). A soft plastic carry bag is also included.The comments in the music tracks listed in this review can be compared to other headphone reviews I've done, to get an idea of how the SRH440 plays the different music tracks listed here compared to other headphones. My suggestion is instead of reading each comment below as an absolute unto itself, you could compare these notes to other reviews as they get posted, and see how the SRH440 compares with each individual track.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has excellent detail and tone with a modest weight, and both male and female vocals sound natural without favoring either. The SRH440 plays this extremely well.Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead (~1980): Strong midrange sound effects - this is a good worst-case test for resonant-type sounds in the most sensitive midrange area. Handled perfectly by the SRH440.Beethoven Symphony 9, Solti/CSO (1972): Excellent overall sound. Of special note here are the bass impacts beginning around 10:30 of the fourth movement. Those impacts are soft and well in the background, but you can feel some of the weight they carry with the SRH440.Black Sabbath - Iron Man (Classic Rock): Very good instrumental detail and the vocal sounds very natural. As with most classic rock tracks, there is very little or no deep bass. The SRH440 plays this music smoothly, and the lack of deep bass doesn't unbalance the treble.Boz Scaggs - Lowdown (1976): Good sound quality - this is a great test for any nasality in the midrange. Handled extremely well by the SRH440.Cantus - Danny Boy (Traditional/Male Choral/Acapella): The SRH440 plays the voices with enough low end warmth and weight to sound very natural, yet there is no added emphasis of the lower register of the male voices on this track.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRH440 reproduces the space and detail convincingly.Catherine Wheel - Black Metallic (~1991): Goth with industrial overtones - I like this since it's a great music composition and the sound effects are smoothly integrated into the mix. This may sound distorted or mushy with some headphones, but the SRH440 renders the deliberate instrumental distortions clearly.Chris Isaak - Wicked Game (Pop/Rock): The SRH440 plays this high treble energy recording very smoothly - the voice and instruments are detailed but not sharp or edgy.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): This track has a good amount of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice is excellent and the tambourine sound has better than average tonality.David Hazeltine - Fur Elise (Jazz): A very high-quality recording from HDTracks. The SRH440 reproduces the instruments smoothly with a spacious ambiance. The wire-brush-on-cymbal harmonics are very extended and detailed.Grieg (Beecham-Royal Philharmonic) - Peer Gynt-Solveig's Lullaby (Classical): This very old (late 1950's) stereo recording must have been made on the most expensive gear in the world, since the overall sound quality and especially Ilse Hollweg's amazing voice are as close to &#34;being there&#34; as I've heard with some of the better classical recordings made since the year 2000. The SRH440 plays this music perfectly.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion in this track hits really hard, and the bass tones beginning around 0:45 have the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind of sound and feel that indicates a good deep-bass response. Overall, the SRH440 plays this music very well.Heaven 17 - Let Me Go (1980's New Wave/Techno): The bass instrument (guitar?) has very good detail, and the voices and ambiance have a &#34;you are there&#34; quality that's uncommon in early 1980's pop music. The SRH440 plays this track perfectly.Hugo Audiophile - 15-16 (Electronic): I'm not sure what the 15-16 stands for - perhaps track numbers from a CD album. The deep-bass tones that start around 33-34 seconds into the track reproduce extremely well with the SRH440. This is a great recording for evaluating whether a headphone's bass will be sufficient for most environments, since for many headphones that have a weaker bass, the deep bass gets absorbed and mostly lost when the environment contains a lot of low-frequency energy.Human League - Keep Feeling Fascination (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's bass line is very detailed, but the somewhat forward voices don't have quite the &#34;you are there&#34; quality of the Heaven 17 track noted above.Jimmy Smith - Basin Street Blues (early 60's): This track has several loud crescendos of brass and other instruments that don't sound clean and musical with some headphones. The SRH440 provides excellent detail. Listen particularly to the second crescendo at 15 seconds in for maximum detail effect. I'd like to emphasize that these crescendos are probably the worst-case test I have for instrument separation and detail, and the SRH440 does those exceptionally well.Kellogg Auditorium, Battle Creek Michigan, Aeolian-Skinner Organ (1933) - Pedal, 32', Resultant, Arpeggio: This 16 hz organ pedal tone differs from other music tones in that you won't &#34;hear&#34; the tone - you'll only feel it. Although most music tones have harmonics (including this one), the harmonics from this tone will be too weak to provide any &#34;feel&#34;, so whatever you actually hear would not be part of the fundamental 16 hz tone. There are ~30 hz sounds in the outdoor environment in big cities, generated by large trucks, buses, and subway trains, and they have a quality of &#34;rumble&#34; that's similar to some deep-bass tones found in music. This 16 hz organ tone is easily distinguished from those sounds when compared on a headphone that has good undistorted response at 16 hz. The SRH440 plays this very well.Mantovani - Sunrise Sunset (Easy Listening, ca. 1972): A master musician and conductor who specialized in light classics and orchestral pop music, Mantovani's accomplishments were overshadowed by music critics who couldn't tolerate the notion of &#34;light classics&#34; or &#34;semi-classical&#34; music, even when those recordings were no threat to the classical music genres. In any case the later Mantovani recordings from the mid-1960's through mid-1970's had the advantage of being mixed for much better hi-fi systems than those which the music critics possessed at the start of the Long Playing (LP) record cycle. Here in 2014, at least some of those digital remasters have improved the sound further, although it's not always the case. This track as played on the SRH440 is an excellent example of the sheer musicality lurking in those later recordings, and is highly recommended for soundstage, instrumental tone, and musical balance.Michael Tilson Thomas - Rhapsody In Blue (20th Century Classic): Great sound and soundstage, and terrific piano playing and tone. There are some very deep bass impacts starting around 38 seconds into the 17:24 length track, and the weight of those impacts is subtle but appreciable with the SRH440.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some nicely-detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are a series of &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRH440 reproduces those sounds very well.Richard Strauss (Mester-Pasadena) - Also Sprach Zarathustra (opening) (Classical): The granddaddy of bass is in the opening 1:50 of this recording, and I've heard it only once on a large and expensive loudspeaker system in Cleveland. For most people, that experience would be indistinguishable from being in a fairly strong earthquake. The SRH440 conveys as much of that experience as is possible on a more-or-less neutral headphone. The tympani also have good impact here.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRH440 renders the tones and transients very well.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are quite strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRH440 delivers the impacts with proper weight and detail, and the horns have the kind of bite that gives them a wonderfully realistic sound.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string tones beginning at 0:18 are fairly soft, and while the bass isn't very deep, it still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, works very well with this track. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(12374, 12388)"

You can also stream your music from google play or pandora as well. I just ordered two more devices for my other home TV's this way no matter what room I'm in, or my family can watch one thing in one room on Netflix and I can watch a different movie on another TV.

B005CLPP84,electronics,How is option?,"My apartment complex used to pay for basic cable. That quit about 5 months ago. I didn't want to pay the $30 or more per month to get the half dozen channels that I actually wanted so I started looking at streaming players. I already used netflix so that was a must have feature and I decided to pick up hulu plus as well. What drove me to the roku though wasn't just the compatibility with the services that I knew I wanted to use, but the breadth of channels and other content that I could access (for free) from the device.Since purchasing the device I've fallen even more in love with it. The channel store is very nice it has all kinds of web based content to fill the void left by leaving cable behind. From free things like TED talks, news channels (ABC, CNN, CBS, BBC, etc), you tube, pandora, and vimeo videos. To pay channels like HBO go (which I'm ""borrowing"" a password for from a friend). I don't tend to play games on the roku, but have tried angry birds and it is entertaining and I could certainly see younger kids enjoying the gaming experience on the roku.I was afraid that I would miss out on picture quality by having to stream from online, but from what I can tell the picture quality is full HD. I even get surround sound on many of the movies and shows that support it. Of course you can turn the quality of the video down and this may become an important feature for some users. I went from using south of 30GB of data per month to closer to 250GB per month when I switched all of my TV service to the roku. As long as you don't have a cap this is fine, but if you do have a low data cap this is something to consider. Most services (Netflix, Hulu, etc) allow you to pick the picture quality from their websites, but there is also a master switch in the roku options menu if you want to turn quality down across the board.The interface of the roku itself is quite simple and intuitive. The channel store could be set up more nicely as it doesn't currently have a search feature, but you can also look at the available channels online and send them to your roku from there. In fact this is the only way to get some of the unlisted channels which carry things like streaming news casts from different parts of the country and other content which isn't provided by any of the media conglomerates.The interface of some of the other apps are better than others. Netflix does come with a nice search feature, but doesn't let you customize the homepage to show the genres that are most important to you. The Hulu Plus homepage will organize episodes or entire series by name or popularity. This can be especially nice when you want to watch recent TV as new episodes are usually the most popular and will drift towards the front of the list. On the other hand the TED talks app has no search feature and only contains about 1/10 the talks that are featured on their website. But I can't fault the device itself for this as these apps are created by third parties.If I did have one complaint for the Roku 2 XS it would be with the remote. And its a very minor complaint. I have a logitech harmony remote which i use to control all of my media components and while it works with most items very well, and does support the roku 2 XS it is not as strong as the regular remote signal. I haven't had any problems with the remote controlling other items so I believe the problem to be with the type of reciever used in the Roku 2 XS. Again the regular remote works fine so this is not a huge deal, but something that might want to be taken into consideration if you want to use a universal remote.TL:DRConclusions:Picture quality: 5 / 5Roku Interface: 4.5 /  5 (lack of a search feature in the channel store)Channel Options: 5 / 5Channel Interfaces: 2-5 / 5 (some are great others are lacking)Things to consider:Do you have a data cap on your internetDo you want to use a universal remote with the Roku(read above if you have fall in these categories)Final Verdict: I would buy it again and lose the cable company in a minute ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4036, 4050)"
B00009XVCZ,electronics,How is the focus?,"Is the Canon 50mm 1.2 L Series worth $1000 more than the 50mm 1.4? Final conclusion was: No, it is not worth it for me. But it might be for you. Here's why and how I came to my conclusion. I have also included some photos I took with the 7D and the 1.4 lens.I have been able to work with the 1.2 before, and was ready to buy my own. Buying the 1.2 was quite a leap, but I knew it would do the job. I researched the 1.4 hoping it could be just as good but for a lot less. What helped me come to my final decision to purchase the 1.4 was a website by Jim Arnold - [...] It has examples of the same shots using both lenses! I was worried that I would want the 0.2 difference in the lens, and I would miss it with the 1.4. But I must say that is not the case at all! This site has a ton of examples using the different lenses. He includes photos taken at f1.2, f1.4, and f2.8Bokeh on the 1.4 - One of the photos I added shows the bokeh of the 1.4. The 1.4 has 8, the 1.8 has 5. The 1.2 has also has 8 blades but produces a little bit smoother bokeh. But when I tested the bokeh on the 1.4 I was not disappointed. The difference was not all that obvious.Why not the f1.8 lens? I would say it's a great starter lens - so if that is what you want then go for it! But I have had friends who have owned this lens to only have it completely fall apart after only 1 year. The 1.8 AF is loud and slow. The 1.4 has a much sturdier build than the 1.8 with better auto focus and less noisy. From experience I would say that the 1.4 can even focus better in low light than the 1.2.The 1.4 is lighter than the 1.2 and feels better on the camera in my opinion - weight feels more evenly dispersed.For shooting video with 1.4 - it focuses better in low light than the 1.2, making shooting a low light scene easier. The 1.4 makes for some pretty footage.1.2L cons - size, weight, high price - And not all that different from the 1.4.1.2L pros - beautiful bokeh, sharpest of these 3 lenes, well made1.4 cons - bokeh not as good as 1.2, but better than 1.8. A little less sharp (but I haven't noticed that personally)1.4 pros - good price, quality, not too different than the 1.2 in picture quality1.8 cons - plastic build, slow and noisy AF, choppy bokeh with 5 blades over 8 in the 1.2 and 1.41.8 pros - great price, great starter lensI enjoy my 1.4 lens VERY much and I am glad I chose it over the 1.2. You need to decide what is important to you when picking a lens. In my case the $1000 price difference just did not make the 1.2 worth it. The 1.4 is a very professional lens and one I will be using a lot. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2590, 2604)"

Overall, it it very comfortable, and I love the thumb rest. This is the mouse I would have designed for myself.I use it for playing World of Warcraft, and while the game does not directly recognize any buttons beyond the first 5, you can program and macro the rest of the buttons, giving you very quick access to lots of stuff.I also really like the scroll wheel. Being able to switch between free scrolling and normal scrolling is great.

The button for switching scrolling modes is right behind the scroll wheel, making mode switching super easy and quick.

You can get a 50% discount on it at time of purchase IF you go through amazon. More about this later.Setting the devices up was easy for the most part. I have no idea why no one sets the interface up to show you the MAC when connecting to an AP (access point). [The MAC might be needed if your filtering clients on your wireless network by MAC address] I have to forgo setting the device up then find the MAC and backtrack to set the device up. Other than that it seems fine. I do notice that when in FreeTime app that when I move from one wireless network to another it doesn't pick up automatically, more on this later.The tablet is very responsive. I'm quite impressed. Everything is fluid and gives me a good feeling about using it. I don't feel like I'm waiting on the device to catch up with my movements.Freetime and Freetime Unlimited are the reasons I went with the Kindle Fire HD, that and the ability to access the children videos for my kids in my Amazon acct.The Freetime app is nice. Its simply clean. You set a password on the app and then at launch the app simply gives access to only which Apps, Videos and Books you choose. No browser although you can start a search and hit the Amazon page. There is no option for Music which makes both sense and no sense. It would be REALLY nice to see a Music option also and to allow the option to allow music by artist, album, song, etc just like you can sort with the amazon music store/player.Freetime Unlimited is a good start at something great. This is supposed to allow access to a slew of apps, videos and books geared towards children so as a parent we will feel safe with them accessing anything on the tablet (Freetime). Most of the content seems to be age appropriate but there were titles in the apps, games and videos I didn't want my children to access. My wife, who has a Masters Degree in Reading (I wont go on about her list of credentials but simply I am VERY proud of her) said some of the content wasn't age appropriate and/or had no educational value for the children. Keep in mind though, this is a new feature and it will most likely get better from here. I would like to see Music added though. I would like to be able to add music content by album, artist, song title, etc from my library. It would be nice to see content added along with the Unlimited plan like Imagination Movers, Fresh Beat Band, etc. that the kids could just play on their own. One thing that I have not been able to do is to delete content included in Unlimited, or at least disable it from being seen. This would be a work around (not a solution) for the content we don't want our children to be exposed to.This is something extra for Amazon to read. If we put in our children's ages I really think the content should be geared towards that age group. Its nice to have some fun material too but if a child is given this device as a pacifier then wouldn't it be nice for them to be able to actually practice things they should be working on in their age group? My wife would be a great addition to your team to help you determine what titles are age appropriate, its what she does for a living :-)About the wireless in Freetime. It seems to have a hard time moving from one network to another sometimes. I think it should connect flawlessly just like a regular tablet does or maybe its just how the Kindle Fire series handles moving from one network to another. Sometimes it says it needs to login and it brings up the Amazon site. It would be REALLY nice if this could be scripted to to be done in the background for Freetime so trusted networks will automatically connect without user (children) interaction.I ordered the ""power block"", a HDMI cable, an Amazon Basics bag for the kids to keep their tablets in and the Marware case (it was a hard choice between the Amazon case but this one was a bit cheaper although has less features). They love them, I strongly suggest getting the Amazon Basics bag. I installed Zagg's standard shield (i hear the HD shields are thinner and not as good). The shields look great and you cant tell they are there when your looking at them. I install these shields on everything, even on gorilla glass devices. It gives a good feel, less mess from oily fingers in my opinion and you don't cringe everything the device rubs across a scratchy surface. Well worth the money.Bottom line is the Kindle Fire HD 7"" is a great purchase for my children. It has been a bit of an expensive but a worthwhile investment. The Freetime Unlimited app has proven to be a great investment also. If you don't see the books, games, videos you want your child to have then you can simply purchase the content and give them access to it on a per item basis. I ordered a camera app for them to play with it, they love to record themselves making funny faces and noises. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4981, 4995)"
B007R5YDYA,electronics,What did you think of the soft focus ring being smooth and that it had enough range to fine tune the amount?,"I bought the Saddle Tan leather cover - the pebble textured finish is flawless!In bright lighting/sunlight, the Saddle Tan leather cover appears more a  'dull orange' but in soft white light/low light conditions it appears more 'yellow brown'.SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESNOTE: The Kindle Paperwhite fits snugly in the leather cover's 'form fitting interior'.  It's a really snug fit!  It's great knowing that my kindle is secure ... but, this snug fit makes it too difficult to take out and put back in easily.  So, if you sometimes like removing your Kindle cover for reading, then I recommend you choose a cover that secures the Kindle with easy to remove and replace straps.I like being able to fold back the leather cover for reading with one hand ... and the cover's woven nylon fabric inner lining has a nice feel.WHAT I LIKE MOST ABOUT THE KINDLE PAPERWHITE LEATHER COVER?The magnetic clasp keeps the cover securely closed without the need for straps.  I simply flip open the cover to start reading on my Kindle.  When I am finished, I just have to close the cover and my kindle goes to sleep.

B0002Y5WZM,electronics,What do you think about pocket?,"This bag is  perfect for my present needs, and even has room for another lens in the future.  In the  main compartment I have, assembled and ready to be used, the Canon T2i with  battery pack and 18-55 kit lens with lens hood.  I put the camera in its place holding the hand grip, which makes it easy to put the camera in the bag and pull it out.  Because the camera is fully assembled, all I need to do is turn it on and remove the lens cover and  it is ready for use.Also in the main compartment is the Canon 55-250 lens with lens hood attached.  The lens is positioned with the lens hood up.  The lens with hood is a fraction of an inch taller than the side of the  bag, but this does not  interfere with the closing of the bag or the use of the side pockets.  When the bag is closed, there is no way to tell that with the lens hood attached the 55-250 lens stands a little taller than the side of the main compartment.There is space left over in the main compartment for another lens, which because I have no other lens at present, I am using to hold a pair of glasses in a case.The 2 large, zippered storage compartments on the outside of the bag, plus the storage in the lid and on the front of the  bag, give me all the room that I need for SD cards, a reserve battery pack for the battery pack, cleaning supplies, a camera manual,Attached to the bottom of the bag are straps intended to attach a tripod to bottom of bag.  Initially I was put off by those straps and had scissors in hand to cut them off.  However, remembering that I have a cheap, light weight tripod in addition to my larger, heavier one, and also realizing that this would be a good place to  carry an umbrella when out of days when weather is questionable, I let the straps alone. Now that I realize that they can at least occasionally be of benefit to me, they no longer bother me.The  bag is well made and attractive and the padding and weather protection are satisfactory.

B002BH3I9U,electronics,How is the expectation?,"I had always wanted a pair of bluetooth headphones, but could never get myself to spend the money on them myself. I received a different pair as a gift for Christmas and loved how they could be applied to my daily life, but they were an in-ear variety that had poor sound quality and was simply uncomfortable to wear.So, i returned them & began shopping around for a decent mid-range over-ear set when I found these. The reviews were glaringly positive & I see why.Sound Quality--I'm a musician, so I have fairly well trained ears. I certainly didn't expect studio quality sound from a $40ish pair of bluetooth headphones. However, the performance and sonic quality of this item greatly exceeded any of my expectations. They sound fantastic and are perfectly acceptable for any casual listener.Microphone Recording Quality--I use Siri quite a bit on my phone & haven't had any problems related to poorly received voice commands. In voice calls the worst people have said is &#34;You sound a little different, but you sound fine.&#34; Again, perfectly acceptable for my standards.Weight--Very light weight. Zero complaints.The Fit--This is wildly different on an individual basis, so I can only relate my experience. I have a bit of a large head and wear glasses. Naturally the concern for anyone with glasses is feeling like you have a pile of stuff pulling down on your ears. These absolutely DO NOT interfere with my glasses. However, I have rather thin framed specs so it allows for plenty of extra room on my ear. That being said, even with thick emo style frames I think these would continue to work without bothering you. I even wear them with glasses while jogging on the treadmill without problems.Cell Phone Integration-- I absolutely love how well this headset works with my phones. I actually use an iPhone 5, but also have an older Evo 4G on hand. It works extremely well with both phones. It syncs quickly and easily, and the right-earphone has 4 well-disguised buttons for call/accept call, skip forward, skip back, and play/pause. All functions worked perfectly on both android and apple platforms. As a pleasant surprise I tapped the call button on my iphone while it was in a standby state. I was delighted to hear the little Siri sound blip in my ear & mic channel open to accept a voice command.Battery Life-- I've used this headset for roughly a half hour a day for a week & still going strong. It advertises 4-6 hours of use & I am inclined to believe it. It seems perfectly acceptable given the fact that this lightweight set of headphones cannot have a large battery in them weighing them down.Range-- Once again I was blown away by the performance. Last night I let my daughter play on my phone upstairs while I played with these downstairs. When I powered them on I was shocked when they connected to my phone 20 yards away through an entire floor's layer of construction. I can basically leave my phone anywhere in my house and simply keep my headset on. VERY nice for those times when you forget to stuff your phone in your pocket before walking away.Final Impressions-- I think what will make or break the use of this product for someone is simply the question of &#34;Does it fit your head?&#34; Beyond that, there's really nothing more you could possibly ask for given the dollars you'd be spending. I am sure there's a pair out there with slightly better sound or an extra button or two, but for the money you simply can't beat these. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3466, 3480)"

B0082YEH8M,electronics,Do you have a good point?,"This case is perfect for the new iPad mini! Not only is it super affordable, but it's very functional. I like the 3 deep grooves for the iPad to rest on (its super secure, it won't collapse or anything). At first I was worried that the case when placed in the groove would stick out too much (and my son would spill food on the inside of the case this way), but it doesn't jut out as bad as I thought it would. They provide an elastic to hold the cover together when you flip it all the way back so it doesn't flop around. The only downside is that elastic covers a sliver of the iPad's right side of the screen.The hand grip is super useful and very stretchy. I have small hands and it accommodates it nicely. This case is made for right handed people though. The hand holder goes on your left hand and you use your right hand to tap the screen. I'm not sure if lefties can use it, since there's only one way you can orient your iPad (because of the cut-out for the camera on the case).The auto-wake and close works great! The magnetic snap is rounded to fit the curve of the side of the iPad so you have to actually exert slight pressure to snap it shut as well as push it slightly to open it. This feature is actually nice because the case won't accidentally flip open in your purse or anything (like the Apple-brand smart cases do--my husband's iPad Smart cover accidentally opens and closes all the time).

They had a bundle package with the tablet sleeve included for $239 (few bucks more than Amazon price after tax but you do get a 90 day exchange).I have to say so far I am very impressed with this samsung tablet.  Its very responsive to the touch seems very fast for what I need it for and the weight is great.  I had the Kindle Fire and I enjoyed it but I do like having access to the Google Market and figured if I need to read books I can always use the Kindle app for android which works very well. I will say the first samsung tablet I picked up I found a few ""lit"" pixels which showed up when using a black background. I took it back to the store and repurchased another one and so far I do not see the same issue.I think the camera even though its getting a bad reputation still is nice since the Fire does not even have one.  I don't see myself out taking snapshots with this thing but sometimes its nice having it and I might try Skype on it at some point.  So far the wifi has worked great, I downloaded about 800mb of music over iSyncr Wifi the other nite along with downloading apps from the google market and did not notice hardly any slow down.  I think for the money this is gonna be a great tablet.  I currently have an ipad 1st gen, Touchpad rooted with Android and a KFire.

I'mused to holding the ipad with one or two hands along the edges.Fortunately, you can adjust the strap length or remove it as necessary. Thestand rotates with the hand strap so you can set it up in any orientation.I found the case to be easy to install and it fits precisely around theipad. This case is designed to cover all the ports so you will need to foldthe covers up to access the ports underneath. Folding these covers out ofthe way is an extra step that takes some getting used to. If you arelooking to provide protection for these ports, the solution works well andlooks good.This is a 3 piece cover designed to protect the whole ipad but not add toomuch bulk. The case is surprisingly light but still provides goodprotection. The inner case is rigid and provides an integral screen guardand a full coverage frame for the outer cover. The outer cover is softerand has flexible covers for the earphone, charger, and mute buttons. Thespeakers and microphone have clear passage ways for good sound performance. Onevery nice feature is that the case does not stick up very much beyond thescreen, this makes it easy and comfortable to hold. The extra width of thecase gives you a place for your thumb and prevents you from triggering thescreen. This is very convenient when holding the screen in landscape modeA few minor concerns: 1) The screen cover is integral to the case so itdoesn't appear to be individually replaceable. 2) there is no Smart Coverfunction to turn off the screen.Overall, a very nice case that serves to fully cover the ipad-mini and yet notinterfere with it's function.

B0044YU60M,electronics,How is the problem solved?,"As Much as I love TV and Netflix, I don't believe how long I allowed my fear of technology keep me from being able to watch Netflix on my TV. One day, I was just looking for a new Blu-ray player that had the Netflix capability and Wi-Fi and I came across the Panasonic DMP-BDT210P which also is 3D.  I don't have a 3D capable TV as yet, but I bought this one with the future in mind...baby steps.  I had no idea what to do about making the Netflix work, but research told me I needed a router.  I'd focused on Cisco routers, but this day, in reading the reviews I decided to look at other routers and I spotted this one and read some of the reviews on it and decided to try this one.  What impressed me the most was the reviewers experience with Medialink contact support. How willing their support group is to ACTUALLY HELP YOU.  I've been so sick of fighting with support personnel on other products purchased.My new blu-ray player and Medialink Wireless N Router arrived the same day.  I'm an older person.  I read the little instruction packet that came with the Medialink router, but I was still scared to try to follow the instructions. There are two little pamphlets one for IF you have a DSL modem, and one for IF you DO NOT have a DSL modem. I determined my modem is a DSL modem.  I re-read the next day.  I asked around at work about setting up a router.  I re-read the instructions AGAIN.  Then one day, I just said, I can do this!  There are 12 sections of info to follow.  My computer is NOT WIRELESS, and that was my biggest concern.  I got through the steps and was confused about WIRED VS WIRELESS.  In one part of the instruction you have the option to change your SSID, I was afraid to because I thought you would have to go through the whole thing again, so at the time I set this router up, I did not originally change the SSID, one of my co-workers told me to DEFINATELY change your passphrase from the products generic passphrase.  That part I did do.You get to the end of it, and I found something about removing the network cables which appears in the instructions on the CD that comes with it, but I don't see it in the instructions on the pamphlet insert for DSL modems. I viewed the CD only after I'd set the router up, and found that the CD has more DETAILED INSTRUCTION on installing.  Anyway, this instruction tells you that you can remove these two network cables after you have set up your router and that is where I freaked out because logic told me that if my computer is NOT WIRELESS in the first place, I cannot remove these network cables without consequences.  So, I didn't do it.  It was after Meidalink hours, when I finished my set up of this router, so I decided to leave the cables plugged and call Medialink the next day to find out what I should do.I called and explained that I was not sure if I'd installed it properly and I had a female representative, and she was very nice and very patient, and she walked me through the ENTIRE steps of setting this up and found that I'd done everything correctly and she told me that changing the SSID to whatever I wanted didn't make me have to go through any other steps and she took me to that part of the installation to change it.  She also told me that I was CORRECT that you DO NOT REMOVE THE NETWORK CABLES from the back of the router and your computer IF YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT WIRELESS.  I was relived that I had not removed them.  She offered to help me set my other wireless items while she was on the phone, but I had not yet connected the Panasonic Blu-ray, and my printer required me to have the disc which I had to find.  Anyway, she told me that if I needed help installing anything I could call and receive help.I got off the phone, was able to connect the printer, and then I connected the Panasonic and it was the simplest thing I could ever have done.  All I had to do was click on Wired or Wireless during the EASY SETUP, and I chose Wireless, and it brought up two networks, one was mine, and one was someone else's, and I chose mine, and it asked for ENCRYTION KEY and I freaked out again because I didn't know what that meant.

I've heard people complain about having to deal with those antenna type routers during certain conditions.  I'd wondered if I'd have go back and buy other gadgets to improve my signal, but so far, it is not necessary.I want to say to anyone who is looking to buy this item, it is a great product.  I DID NOT USE THE INSTALLATION CD to install it.  I just followed the 12 steps of information.  When you get to step 8 you are given the option to move on to step 9 or to pop in the CD.  For some reason the word (recommended) made me choose to proceed to step 9, and it all turned out perfectly.  So they are telling you the truth that you don't really need the installation CD to set this up, and I think that if your computer is WIRELESS you wouldn't keep the network cords but if your computer is like mine, and it you didn't buy it WIRELESS, you need to leave the network cords attached.Medialink - Wireless N Router - 802.11n - 150 Mbps - 2.4 Ghz - NEW Design w/ Internal Antenna ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5678, 5692)"

The size is great, and the speakers are much better than I had expected for a $20 usb-powered devise. They are reasonably loud - at least twice as loud as the macbook speakers - and have decent sound quality, if only a little bass heavy. The padding on the underside makes resting the laptop on your lap a bit more comfortable, although I was hoping it to be a little softer. The pad feels like a towel that had been folded a couple times, which is nice, but I have used a similar product that had small foam pellets that more evenly distributed weight over your thighs and was a bit more comfortable over long periods.Although this product does everything it claims to do very well, in retrospect, I would rather have spent a bit more to get a product that included a fan for ventilation. This product has no mechanism or design feature that dissipates heat, which is the only flaw I could find (although admittedly, it is not something the product claims to do.)4 out of 5 for a great product, especially for the price, although there are certainly some features to be desired.

I like the look and feel of the remote.  It's easy to use and the buttons are easy to depress. The backlighting is a very nice feature. Also, the remote sits snugly in its cradle, unlike the Harmony 880, which took careful pressure in order to get it to charge properly.The touch screen works pretty well, but it's easy to accidentally press the wrong button if you aren't looking closely.My main issue with this remote was: about 30 days after I got it, I noticed the ""off"" button was getting harder and harder to press.  I contacted Logitech and they promptly sent me a refurbished remote as a replacement. I appreciated the quick response and that I wasn't required to send my old remote back (they just deactivated it in the system so I can't make updates to it), but that doesn't change the fact that I only had a new remote for 30 days before I had to settle for a refurbished one.

B005CLPP84,electronics,Why the performance of this lens is very poor?,"I really wanted to like this device. Great concept and can save you hundreds on Cable TV bills, but most recent changes basically broke the product, which used to be a more reliable device and better value for your money.--The positive--If you are into movies, already have a Netflix or you're an Amazon Prime subscriber and you don't have any game console at home, this is a great little device. For about 100 dollars and without any extra monthly payments, you will be able to enjoy tons of movies for free, even some important TV shows.The interface is relatively easy to use, but configuring channels require a PC. This is kind of annoying when you have to do that with several channels, wish you can do that directly with the console only, but once you passed that stage let's say there are no more extra steps or additional settings that you need to tweak.On the aesthetic side, is really small. The company also states it uses less power than previous model, but I honestly do not think that you will save thousands of dollars anyway; the biggest savings come from dropping your Cable TV service altogether.--The not so nice and what changed --Here's are the bad news. The firmware and software is buggy. I was watching Amazon on demand and the stuff restart twice. It happened several times and continue to happen, even after firmware upgrade. Something similar with Netflix. The ""supported"" channels take an eternity to load, like CNN. I understand that this device is basically a ""man in the middle"", just streaming the online content to your TV, but the previous model was much more stable (I sold it to get this one)But, If you are more into TV shows or live news, you are out of luck with Roku 2. Most of the unofficial channels do not work anymore: PlayOn, Plex, NokNok. Those basically allow  you to watch local USA TV or CBS on your TV, via Roku. They were working on the previous model, for some weird reason (copyright issues or software problems) they no longer work on this one and no ETA of when is going to be fixed, maybe never, who knows.So in a nutshell. You will loose the capability of watch those unofficial channels I mentioned, some ports were removed, the box is smaller and uses less power, and gives you a higher resolution for some movies or show. Worth the money? I don't think so. You can do exactly the same (with the exception of games and getting a higher resolution) with the Roku 1. Hence, I don't see a reason to upgrade or buy the new one.This is a nice product but it is too buggy or the company started to loss its battle against major TV stations.By the way, I currently have a 12Mbps Internet connection. Not a T1 or Fiber Optic, but more than enough to handle HD video streamingBuy the previous model instead and enjoy while it last ... it is a shame that USA users are condemned to pay higher bills if we want live TV and good programming...** EDIT ***8/16/2011Bought the previous model again, which I sold by mistake. Run the setup, added PlayOn, it works!!! Time to sell Roku 2.People, this is one of those cases where new does not mean better or faster. Just one more comment, we can still have or get 1024 dpi resolution on previous model. Also, most channels are not providing anything higher than 740, so even in resolution you're not going to lose anything if you buy the previous model instead.I would probably take a look on Roku 2 on 6 months or so, when it gets a more stable firmware and patches.For those interested: my PlayOn runs on a Mac mini 2010. The Mac Mini has 8GB of RAM and I assigned 2GB to the virtual machine. The virtual machine runs Windows XP SP3 and the virtualization software is Parallels.

B006ZP8UOW,electronics,How about view?,"Preface:  My camera experienced a reboot and freeze when I maxxed out the contrast to &#34;6&#34; from the preset of &#34;4&#34;.  I noticed no picture quality difference so I returned the contrast setting to 4 after the reboot.I am finding this 640 x 480 quality camera perfect for basic surveillance and security.  It has an excellent mounting bracket and utility/control program.  I mounted it on the ceiling upside down.  The daylight picture quality is adequate and the nighttime infared (doesn't work through windows) is surprisingly good IMHO for such a relatively cheap camera that has two way audio.  The 270 degree rotation plus the up and down range provides an ample range of view.  I was able to figure out how to setup remote viewing by using the port forwarding instructions provided on the website.  The wait for tech support was surprisingly short.  I actually was able to speak to a live person from some offshore help desk.  My questions were pretty basic but I was able to get everything setup and running with a matter of a couple of hours.  I had to hop in my car and drive to an internet caf&eacute; to confirm the remote viewing.  I couldn't confirm remote access in my house.  Doh!  I followed the security advice and purchased a DDNS provider for $19.95 per year to get a unique web address (no need to make things easy for hackers that flock to the free Foscam DDNS site).  The basic utility that allows you to setup users with ADMIN, OPERATOR, or VISITOR levels of access along with their passwords is pretty straight forward.  All this for about $70 plus the $19.95/yr for a unique DDNS.  In short, I am pleasantly surprised how easy it is to do this for such little money.Additional note on the Freezing Issue:  The Contrast is set to 4 and it works fine (backyard/garden/trees view).  I experienced the freezing and reboot when I set the contrast to 6.  It gave some warning signs when part of the picture started to freeze.  I set the contrast back down to 4 when it rebooted itself.  Given that I saw no discernible difference between a contrast of 4 and 6 (looking through a window to the outside) I am not concerned.  The indoor picture quality is acceptable.  Given the slow internet in my area and my desire to add additional cameras, I am happy with the 640 x 480 quality.

I use these features of my wifi network multiple times throughout the day and this has been incredibly frustrating.I'm waiting to hear back from tech support before I box this up and send it back.  I really want to like it...it's nice looking, and fast, but I need the above features to work, or the router is near useless to me.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This was an upgrade from a Comcast leased router that, in all honesty, was perfectly fine.  We were just tired of paying for it every month.  I've only had this router for a day, but setup only took seconds.  The setup page is pretty easy to navigate and I had no problems renaming our network, creating a passcode, and forwarding the necessary ports to get my torrent clients up and running.  I don't notice any significant speed increase over a wireless G router, but very few systems are able to utilize the 150mbps this thing is capable of providing.  Anyway, the signal is strong and it's as speedy as expected.I've owned quite a few routers in my day and most of them are pretty straight forward pieces of equipment.  This one receives five stars because it does what it's supposed to and hasn't hickupped so far.  I will update my review in a few months when I have a better idea of durability and quality over time, but I don't foresee any issues.For the price, a GREAT buy, and I highly suggest getting the bundle that Amazon offers with this modem:Motorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modem.  The combination is stellar.  Very happy buyer :) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2594, 2608)"
B0019EQ1RW,electronics,How is the signal strength?,"I bought this router for a few key reasons over other better known units: price, gigabit ethernet, 802.11n, and (most importantly to me) hackability.  I can't stand most routers' stock firmware.  The interface is typically very clunky, and many features and options I like to have at my disposal are unavailable.  This router is fully supported by the DD-WRT project, and it works perfectly.This router is fine out of the box for the average user who doesn't want to spend a whole lot of time setting it up, but if you're more of a power user this is definitely one worth getting.  I prefer having the external antennae over the internal ones many routers now have.  It's nice to be able to position the antennae for optimum throughput and range, and to be able to swap them out if you want different ones.  I also use aRoku 2 XSthat I have connected via ethernet, so having Gigabit is a bonus.Admittedly it's not the most stylish router on the market, but it's a lot more capable and customizable than the designer ones.You can't go wrong with this box.

B006ZH0KJS,electronics,How black is this color?,"This review is for the 55"" Cinema Screen 55LM6700First, this TV is really striking.  The cinema view (no frame around the edge of the screen) is very nice, and everyone who sees it notices it right off the bat and makes a complimentary comment.The colors are fantastic, and clarity, too.  One problem with this is that you can TOTALLY tell when a television show is not filmed in true HD (ie 720p instead of 1080p)...so not all ""HD"" channels are truly HD...The remote interface is cool.  Very much like the Wii, it's a point and click, as in you get an arrow that moves around and like a wand, you just aim and click.  There are many apps, including Hulu and Hulu Plus, etc. (They are listed above, so I won't bore you.)  Be aware, if you do not have very high speed internet service, you will have trouble with streaming HD movies.Setting up the WiFi is easy.  Just follow the directions and be sure your router is set to ""pair"".  Be sure you have the WPA code available, too.The sound is great--and I LOVE the option to amp up voices.  I have a problem with my hearing and cannot hear mid-range tones (voices).  I have always had trouble with normal TV's.  Not this one.  Awesome.Watching movies is clear, and the 2D-to-3D feature works amazingly well!  (Better than the new Titanic movie, I can tell you that...the one they just redid in 3D...)  I'm impressed!The 3D movies make you want to reach out and touch someone.  Really.The glasses are really nice!  They are light and you don't realize they are on after awhile.  Unlike the old-school 3D TV's, you don't need batteries.  And getting 6 pair is a super deal.I left it on for hours, to see if it got hot (like some other TV's do).  It did not.  Very nice.Now, the bad...(Yup, there's bad...and no matter what I did, I couldn't get around it.)The black depth could be better.  It's more like dark gray.  I turned off the backlight (it's annoying to me) and still I don't get the depth I'd expect from a TV.When the TV shows a black (yes, dark-gray, but for all intents it ""thinks"" it's black) you see various halos around the screen's edge.  At first there was just one.  Now there are 6.  I called customer service, and they were NOT HELPFUL at all.  I had the TV for a day and called, and still they tried to blame it on using HDMI cables, instead of the supplied component cables.  I switched to component, and the halo was still there.  I switched back and it didn't change.  Nothing to do with cables.  I googled it and it seems that this is a common problem.  But LG threatened to charge me if I asked someone to come check it out.  Not cool.  Even when I told them that I was reviewing it here, they didn't seem to care.Obviously, I am not going to pay to have someone come out...So, the bottom line is that it's a great TV, but not perfect.  If you're into deep colors, you have to really play with it to get it, and still your blacks could be better.  The halos drive me batty, but not enough to get rid of the TV.  They do not show up when there is an actual show on--only when it's a black screen, like the menu or when you turn the cable box off and you get the blank screen.The voice-option makes it a winner to me.  The 3D is amazing. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3207, 3221)"
B003ELYQGG,electronics,How much is the sound quality compared to more updated versions?,"This is a great value for casual listening.  I usually fall asleep listening to old spoken-word recordings which means I go through a lot of earbuds (tossing and turning pulls on the wires).  So to remain well-rested and financially solvent I need earbuds that are inexpensive and comfortable. I'm also a former (alas) musician and am demanding of sound quality.These Panasonic units fit the bill as decent, semi-disposable earbuds. They're very comfortable for my purpose. Since the earbud part is offset from the body of the driver, the driver doesn't press against the ear when sleeping on one's side. They've also held up to a couple months' use.The weakest point is sound quality. While not really objectionable, these buds are weak in bass and have a noticeable upper-midrange peak that the casual listener may perceive as ""clarity."" I'd rather the response was more even.

B005HMO6A6,electronics,Does this have the ability to use batteries?,"-Love this product!  I have tried other wireless keyboards, but usually I opt out to scrapping the keyboard and just use the case by itself, but the Airbender Case/keyboard is definitely a keeper.1) It is functional and easy to use as a case and a keyboard.  Functionally from a keyboard perspective I had no issue with sync'ing it up via bluetooth to my Ipad.  Overall the keyboard is responsive, I have not had an issue yet with it either dropping or disconnecting or not recognizing my key strokes.2) Keyboard is nice, keys have a nice heft and snap to it so it feels responsive, almost like a normal keyboard.  Size is nice as well and has the basic keys you would want on a keyboard with other hotkey functions that I like, not having to go through the apple menu options to access (brightness, sound, pictures, internet, etc.)3) Keyboard attached to the Ipad is versatile and works well together, allows for multiple orientations and tilts, one thing it does not do is allow you to extend the ipad away from the keyboard.  Another thing I noticed was If you use the tilt with the whole arm it works fine, but if you try to tilt the screen without moving the arm, it will move back to rest on the arm, not a big deal but an observation I had.  Another thing that I noticed was that sometimes if you had the case open, the weight of the Ipad could tilt the entire case backwards.4) The case itself combined with the keyboard is solid, i have no problem carrying the whole thing around, it does add weight, but what do you expect with an additional keyboard.  I would like to have had the surfaces with more of a rubbery or raised feel so it is easier to grip.  It does allow you to separate the case from the keyboard, but only offers back protection when separate.Overall the case as a whole is great, I do not think I will use just a normal case without the keyboard, this provides so much more function to the overall product.  I no longer an weary of writing long emails on my Ipad now that I have the keyboard to match.  It also provides the needed support and protection to keep your Ipad running for a long, long time!  5***** I would definitely recommend. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2168, 2182)"

B0035FZJHQ,electronics,How good is the quality of the  sound?,"Whether you're new to the world of DSLRs, or are a seasoned photographer who wants to try your luck at video, the Canon Rebel T2i is perfect. I've had nothing but great experiences with it so far, and highly recommend to everyone.Other than the T2i, I own (and primarily shoot with) the Rebel XS (1000D), and also have extensive experience with the Canon 50D. While my XS still serves me very well, I wanted to get an SLR with video capabilities since the release of the T1i. After finally saving up enough for the T1i, I really lucked out that Canon announced the T2i, which has even better features! I am lucky enough to finally have it, and want to share my experiences, and how they compare to my expectations==================OVERALL IMPRESSIONSThe camera is very small and light. It is not weather-sealed or as durable as some of the more expensive SLRs, but it doesn't ""feel cheap"" in my opinion. It features a 3-inch LCD (compared to the Rebel XS's 2.5 inch screen), which also has a very high resolution. It looks lovely! Auto-focus is fast, and I've been very pleased with the quality of the pictures and videos I've taken so far.==================PROSIMAGE QUALITY: I feared that cramming so many megapixels onto this sensor, there would be a lot of image 'noise' (the megapixel myth). This thankfully hasn't been an issue, and I've been very pleased with the pictures taken with this camera! Aside from White Balance issues (see below, Cons), image quality is pretty good!VIDEO: Some people have disparagingly said that Video on DSLRs is just a gimmick. I disagree. Based on sample clips I'd seen on YouTube, I was excited about getting an HDSLR, and while videos are sometimes shaky if you don't have very steady hands, a tripod eliminates those concerns. Audio quality on the T1i was criticized by many, but the T2i has a microphone input jack, which allows you to connect a mic. I don't yet own one so can't comment on that feature, but will update this review if and when I save enough to try this feature out. Additionally, this offers improved recording options, including higher fps (frames per second) than the T1i, which technically offered ""true HD"" recording of 1080, but only at a choppy 20 fps.LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE: I am much more impressed than I expected. My Rebel XS could go up to ISO 1600, but would perform pretty poorly there. This not only can go up to a significantly higher ISO level, but performs much better. Less image noise means you have to waste less time editing your pics, and many more keepers!SDXC SUPPORT: Only own SDHC cards up until now, but it's great to know that this supports the next generation of flash storage, which means you'll in the future be able to hold many more pictures than currently available.CONSNOT A FULL-FRAME SLR: This is not a full-frame SLR like the Canon 5D Mark II, and the APS-C sized sensor results in a crop factor (1.6x), and doesn't necessarily provide the same image quality as the larger, full-frame sensor does. Still, at less than half the cost of the Mark II, I think this is a trade-off that's well worth it for most users.Crop factor means that this camera, like other Canon DSLRs that have the APS-C size image sensor, will not be true to the lens's designation. A 50mm lens will produce an image more in line with 50mm x 1.6, or 80mm on a full-frame. This not only makes a difference for those who want to do landscape photography (which usually benefits from wide-angle views), but for those with unsteady hands. The general logic is that to ensure a steady shot, you need to shoot at the reciprocal of your focal length. So for a 50mm focal length, you should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/50 second for a steady shot. Keeping the crop factor in mind, you really should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/80 a second.Crop factors are common for most digital SLRs, as full-frame sensors jack up the cost of production, which are then passed on to the consumer in the form of very expensive cameras. So it's not so much a shortcoming of the Rebel T2i, but just a note to keep in the back of your mind.DIFFERENT BATTERY: This is more of a hassle for those who owned spare batteries than for those whose first SLR would be the T2i, but Canon changed the battery. Again, not such a big deal, but might be a hassle for some who find out that their old batteries can't be used on this model.WHITE BALANCE: I found that the 'Auto' White-Balance setting was wildly inaccurate on my Rebel XS (often giving indoor shots a yellow tint unless I changed the WB to the 'Incandescent Light' mode), and I feel that the WB settings on this model still aren't as accurate as they should be. If you want truly accurate WB, you can use a gray card, or an alternative would be to simply try digitally editing the photos on your computer after shooting.NO ARTICULATING SCREEN: No articulating screen, but this is a rare feature in DSLR's in general, so it's not a shortcoming of the T2i. Since most of your shots will probably be composed using the viewfinder, not a big deal, although it would have been convenient! If you absolutely must have an articulating screen on an HDSLR, look into the Nikon D5000.===================A NOTE ABOUT THE KIT LENSThe lens that comes with this is the standard 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 that comes with the other Rebels. It's a very good all-around lens, but you more likely than not will want to at some point upgrade your lens for either (a) better image quality, or (b) better performance in low-light conditions.This lens is very good, but for pros or those who pay incredibly close attention to detail, the optical quality of Canon's higher-end lenses is superior than to the kit lens. For most users, I don't think image quality will be a huge issue.More likely, the aperture size will be the reason people want to upgrade their lens over time.  A lens with a wider aperture allows more light to reach the sensor in less time than a lens with a narrower aperture. That means you can employ a faster shutter speed, which allows you to snap the shot faster, reducing the likelihood of a blurry picture. Outdoors on a sunny day, this aperture range of this lens won't be a limiting factor; inside a poorly-lit gym, however, you'll notice some blurry shots (see below for a recommended alternative for low-light shooting).Still, this is a pretty good all-around lens that can result in some great shots!===================RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES1. An external flash: This will come in very handy. With the built-in flash, your photos often come out harshly lit. Bouncing an external flash off the wall makes a huge difference in image quality. I personally use the Speedlite 580EX II, but there are cheaper alternatives that are very good. Some higher-end cameras (i.e. Canon 5D Mark II) don't even have a built-in flash, which goes to show something about how high-level photographers view the lighting provided by internal flashes.2. 50mm f/1.8 II lens - At around one hundred dollars, this lens is relatively cheap when compared to others on the market. Despite its low price, it offers great image quality. While it lacks IS (image stabilization) like some other Canon lenses (including the kit lens), with a wide aperture of f/1.8, enough light usually comes in to ensure a fast shutter speed, which in turn minimizes camera shake. Keep in mind that as a 'prime' lens, your feet will have to do the zooming in and out. This is not as convenient as an everyday walk-around lens like the 18-55 kit lens which gives a good zoom range, but is a great lens for portraits. Also would ideally be a good option for poorly-lit places where the aperture of the kit-lens isn't wide enough to ensure a steady shot.CONCLUSIONSFrom my list of 4 pros and 4 cons, you might wonder why I'm giving this product 5 stars?... It's because considering the great performance - and low price - of the T2i, the 'cons' I list really aren't that big of a deal. Just because some cameras offer the aforementioned features the T2i lacks, it doesn't mean the T2i isn't a solid performer.  On the contrary, I have been completely satisfied with this camera's image and video quality, performance, features, AND PRICE, and would recommend the T2i to anyone looking for an affordable way to capture memories!------------------EDIT 11/27/10I just wanted to update this review to say that after shooting with the T2i for nearly half a year, I'm still as impressed by this camera as when I first got it. I have a few comments to expand on my initial review:VIDEO  I have been using the video mode a lot more than I initially expected. While it doesn't offer continuous auto-focus and therefore might not replace a camcorder, once you get the hang of manually focusing this is not a big problem. I many times have found myself in situations where photos couldn't capture the moment as well as a video could, and the ability to record clips has been very convenient.A note on the video mode, however...while it's automatic exposure is fine for most situations, if you find your videos are grainy, it's best to manually control the exposure. I've seen that sometimes even in good lighting, the camera will keep the aperture small (to have a less shallow depth of field) and boost the ISO. You can get around that by manually adjusting exposure settings, but again, the automatic exposures are usually fine.As for audio with videos, I personally still have not purchased an external microphone, but for those who are serious about movie production Amazon sells a highly popular 'Rode VideoMic' for a reasonable price. I have looked up videos on YouTube which demonstrate the difference between the built-in mic and an external mic, and while it's  tempting, I'd rather spend my money on better lenses than audio accessories.CROP FACTOR  To clarify on my 'crop factor' point from above on a full-frame vs. a crop-sensor body, there is a useful video on Vimeo that illustrates what I'm talking about. If you Google '5D 7D crop factor Vimeo' it comes up as the first result. As you can see, a full frame camera offers a view truer to the lens designations. Again, full frame cameras are costlier to make and therefore more expensive to the consumer, so APS-C sensor cameras like the Rebel T2i, 60D, and 7D are very good values for the money. But if you are not on a tight budget and think you might one day want to upgrade to a full frame some day for the improved low-light performance, higher image quality, and wider field of view, maybe skip on a T2i and just aim for a 5D Mark II (I personally love my T2i, but am excited about some day having my 24-105 shoot wider than its current effective 38-168 range.). For most users, however, APS-C sensor cameras like the T2i should be great, and some might even find the crop factor useful for telephoto work.LENSES  After spending so much money on a camera body, many people have a difficult time justifying buying expensive lenses, and I understand that. After upgrading from the 18-55mm kit lens to the 24-105L lens, however, I can honestly say that the money is well worth it. Colors are more vivid and truer to real life than the [now noticeably] duller colors produced by the non-L lens, and I rarely use the kit lens now. Again, the 18-55 is very versatile and provides a great value, but if you can afford to upgrade your lens to Canon's L series, you won't regret it. Perhaps try before you buy, to see for yourself what I'm talking about.LOW LIGHT  While this camera offers a boost ISO mode (to 12800 from 6400), I don't use that since its results are too grainy for my liking. But for night shots without a tripod, I have found ISO 3200 and 6400 to be a real advantage over my previous Rebel XS which only went up to ISO 1600, and even then produced noisier images than the T2i at 1600. While this camera doesn't produce high ISO pictures as cleanly as a full frame 5DMk2 does, at a fraction of the price I am incredibly pleased with this camera.MEMORY CARD  Lastly, I wanted to recommend you do a lot of research into which SD card you want to use. Class 6 or higher is recommended, but look into reviews to see how the card actually performs. I used to use a Transcend Class 6 card since it's very affordable, and have had movies abruptly stop recording at inopportune times. I upgraded to a Transcend Class 10, and unfortunately continue to have that happen. Not all Class 10 cards necessarily write at the same speed, so look thoroughly into reviews if you plan on using video mode to ensure you get a reliable, high-speed card. The Transcend cards are a great value for the money, and have many times been fine, but you might want to consider more expensive alternatives for greater reliability.------------------EDIT 01/28/11I wanted to update this review to reflect the fact that the camera is still serving me well, and to recommend some additional accessories I have since paired my T2i with. I recently got theInduro AKB0 Tripod Kit (Black),Joby GP8-BHEN Gorillapod Focus with Ballhead X bundle,Dolica WT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod, andCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, and highly recommend them.CAMERA SUPPORT  With the T2i you can pull off handheld shots in low light by cranking up the ISO, but even though the T2i shows relatively little noise, it does show more than some would like in their shots (especially at ISO 6400). Digital noise can be reduced in post-production, but it's much easier to shoot at a lower ISO in the first place, especially for night shots. After paying so much for a camera body and other accessories, buying an expensive tripod might be the last thing you'd want to do, and I understand that: for a while I was using an older, cheaper tripod that was designed more for light camcorders than SLRs with heavy lenses. While this set-up technically worked, I didn't feel very confident in its reliability. After doing a lot of research and asking many photographers, I got the Induro kit, and have been very happy with it so far. It is more expensive than I would have liked, but it doesn't make sense to skimp on support and risk damaging your gear! With tripods, you have to make trade-offs between price, sturdiness, and weight, and while I'm happy with my tripod, it might not be adequate for your needs. There are many websites with tips on what to look for in a tripod (i.e. ball head, pan-tilt head, etc) that can help you make an informed decision. The Gorillapod is not nearly as essential to your shooting as a dedicated tripod, but I recommend it if you find yourself in situations where you don't want to/might not be permitted to carry a tripod, but need support. It sets up much faster than a tripod which needs to have its legs extended and locked. Lastly, a monopod is a great way to stabilize your shots without the hassle of having to carry a tripod, and is even more portable than a Gorillapod. That being said, it doesn't provide as much stability, so I use it primarily to stabilize video shooting (which can be a bit shaky due to composition through LCD screen instead of viewfinder, especially with a telephoto lens).TELEPHOTO LENS  The T2i has a high resolution sensor that, in my experience, provides for great shots even after cropping. I have taken shots and cropped to 100% and been pleased with results, but sometimes you want extended reach without cropping, and here a good telephoto really shines. Canon and third-party lens manufacturers offer many great telephoto options for the T2i, and it's important to think of what you need a telephoto lens for before investing in one. If you'll primarily be shooting with a tripod, you probably don't need IS; if you're going to be shooting in adequate light, a wide aperture isn't essential. I used the Canon 70-300 non-L non-IS lens, but don't recommend it. Keeping in mind the reciprocity of focal length and shutter speed, Image Stabilization on a telephoto lens makes things much easier for hand-held shooting. I much preferred the 55-250 IS over my 70-300 non-IS (there are also IS versions of the 70-300), but found its low-light performance was weak due to its relatively small maximum aperture size. I recently got the 70-200 2.8 IS II, and am blown away by its fast auto-focus, great low-light performance, and superior optical quality. It is an expensive lens, but is well worth it if you need a fast lens (wide aperture) that features Image Stabilization.--------------------------EDIT 02/07/11 *FINAL UPDATE*NEW REBEL  The T2i's successor, the T3i has just been announced, and will be available in March. Based on its specs, I don't think this is a necessary upgrade for current T2i owners. The main improvements found in the T3i are a swiveling screen, wireless flash transmitter, improved Auto mode detection, an enhanced Movie Zoom mode, and creative filters. Of these, I think the most important or sought-after improvements are the flash transmitter (which is is great for advanced shooters and those who want to explore with lighting) and the swiveling LCD screen (which allows for more flexibility in shooting). While these are useful new features, they are largely incremental and I will be sticking with my T2i. For new buyers, the T3i looks great and is very worth looking into when it comes out. Canon also announced a T3 camera to succeed the Rebel XS, which is great for beginners but is lacking in features compared to the T2i and the newly-announced T3i, including the ability to capture 'true HD' at 1080. Even with Canon's recent announcements, I think the T2i is a great DSLR and I highly recommend it to everyone.----------------------------EDIT 06/13/11 *THIS REALLY IS THE FINAL UPDATE*I know this review is now longer than some novels, but I really can't stress enough how great this camera is. I've used this in a variety of settings, both professionally and for personal use, and it's served me so well throughout. While I've shot events before, last night I shot the Tony Awards in NYC...which meant many thousands of shots over the course of many hours...and I was highly impressed with the T2i's performance. I did have to change batteries during the course of the event, but that was many hours into the event. You can easily get a spare third-party battery for just a few bucks.I recently purchased a cheap (less than 20 dollars) intervalometer from Amazon, and have started creating time-lapse videos with my T2i. Setting up cool time-lapse, and capturing HD video, are two areas where an articulating screen (like that found on the T3i and 60D) would come in handy, but again, this is not an essential feature, so I am pleased with my T2i. The intervalometer I got through Amazon was third-party, but since it cost about a tenth of the official Canon one, I am very pleased and highly recommend it if you want to take your T2i to the next level.The T2i is an amazing camera. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who is even remotely interested, whether you never owned an SLR before, or want a second body as a backup. I love the T2i!

If this is not your first digital MP3 player, this won't be a problem, but it's a bit of an adjustment.* the display is black with bright blue LED.  Unlike the black on pale-grey of the Nano.  Again, I find this handy, and actually easier to read in the dark, but you might find it glaring.* because it's really just an MP3 player, unlike a full on sexy Ipod, you can't really store pictures or anything other than audiofiles here.  Again, I'm used to a nano, so it's the same thing. But if you're used to a more scaled up Ipod, this might seem restrictive.* earbud phones.

In addition,I wanted to be able to view HBO GO and Netflix movies on a bedroom TV.  I selected the XS model because I wanted the wired connection.  This thing is great.  It took less than 2 minutes to set it up and go to the channel store.  5 minutes later I had Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO, and Plex installed along with a few more that I had never heard of but caught my interest.  Each one of these was easy to set up.  Plex is the one that allows me to stream locally stored movies and tv shows from a network server.  I have Plex set up on a computer in my home office.  It goes out onto the web and locates movie posters for shows and movies.  The ROKU Plex app displays the movies and shows using these posters.  The interface is solid and smooth and everything has worked flawlessly so far.  My bedroom TV is an older plasma with no HDMI inputs.  I had no trouble using a cable with HDMI on one end and DVI on the other for video that fits my TV.  The ROKU also has a video/audio output that uses an included cable to output an old fashioned SD yellow video, with red and white stereo audio outs.  I used the audio outputs from this jack along with the HDMI to DVI video for 720 video (the best that TV has).  I was worried that plugging in one of the cables would disable the other, but there was no issue.

B0087NZ31S,electronics,Is the unit easy to configure?,"If you have a big house with multiple floors and/or outdoor areas of your home where you would like to receive good wifi coverage, this is a great choice for a range extender.  Probably would be a good primary router as well, but I use it as a range extender. I now get 3 bars downstairs where I used to get zero signal, and 4 bars out on the deck.I wish I could say the set up was easy, but because my wifi router is 7 years old and was set to WEP security it wasn't the simplest to get it to work. I had to call tech support. Thankfully the woman was incredibly helpful. She walked me through switching my router's security type to WPA and then the set up for the Almond Securifi was a breeze. So if you've got a newer main router to begin with, or at least one not using outdated security types, you'll probably just plug it in, click on the signal from your current router in the list, enter your router password, then wait 30 seconds for the Almond to do the rest. You'll then see a graphic showing the connection and can just direct your devices to the new signal instead of the old one. She was also going to show me how to merge the listings for the two signals, so that only one would show instead of ABC and ABC_almond, but I actually prefer seeing the two separate.I love that you can visually see the connection, and that each morning when I plug both devices in again, since I unplug both devices overnight (don't want to expose myself to more electromagnetics than necessary), within just seconds it finds all its settings and there are those green visuals showing the connection again. No need to reconfigure anything.It's also quite small and sleek looking, so not an eyesore in the middle of the kitchen (the halfway point in my house).  I like it so much that when I decide to retire my old router I will definitely be getting a second one of these. It's signal is also not quite strong enough to cover my entire property with just one (has range of 100 ft), but with two of them I'll be in great shape.Special bonus, if you are a T-mobile cell user, you already know you can use your wifi connection to make calls and send texts/surf the web. So extending your wifi range to all of your property, not just where your computer is, will be even more worthwhile.

B00009R6TA,electronics,Where can I get  extra space room for trucks?,"Please note that I am not comparing this backpack to any other camera backpack. I am simply making a value judgement based on the price I paid -- about $35.00.I've had the pack for about two weeks now, and have loaded it up with a bunch of stuff, including two digital bodies, three zoom lenses, a Speedlite flash, a pocket tri-pod, a flash diffuser and an extra lense bag.  All of that is inside the main compartment. I am very pleased with how the main compartment can be sub-divided to fit just about any camera attachments you might have. Padding all around is quite adequate, although a bit more could be used at the top of the bag where the camera body and lense typically sit.The two zippered mesh compartments inside the main flap hold quite a bit of stuff, including the camera manual, flash manual, and various extra flash cards and batteries.The two velcroed pockets on either side of the bag are not designed to protect, but to hold stuff. That's fine with me, so I don't put anything in them that I mind getting wet or dusty.The main compartment flap has two zippered pockets on the outside. The bigger of the two pockets unzips on both sides and the top, and reveals two more small pockets and a small snap-hook. I use this pocket to store a photographic magazine or two I'm reading, cables, etc.The other zippered pocket on the main flap zips across the top and is wide and deep enough to hold quite a bit more stuff, stuff that is flat or can be flattened.The very outside of the main flap also has an open, expandable stretch-cord pocket that can be used to stuff in a light windbreaker.My impression is that this bag has so many pockets and compartments that you could overload it if you are not careful. Before using this bag, I had cameras and accessories in three different ""regular"" camera bags. Now it's all in one place, and I would not consider going back to a regular camera bag -- even if I do have to set the pack down before opening it up to retrieve cameras and accessories.Regarding quality of material and work, I am quite pleased. No frayed straps, no broken buckles, no weak seams, no shoddy workmanship.So the question is, for $35.00 did I get a good camera backpack? My answer without hesitation is, ""Yes."" Does this pack have the same quality and features of a $65.00 or $100.00 pack. No, of course not.BOTTOM LINEFor $35.00 my expectations were exceeded by this bag.

B0030MITDK,electronics,How is the image of the company?,"My Playsport died halfway through my honeymoon. I am astounded by the poor durability of this unit and am glad I brought my Canon camera w/ UW case as a backup and standby. The Playsport doesn't seem to handle humid conditions well. After getting in the water (no more than 4-5 feet of water in 80-85 degree water temp, 90 degree air temp and 70%~ humidity), I noticed the Playsport was having issues turning on underwater. I immediately got out and started noticing condensation build up on the inside of the screen.  After turning it on again, I started getting a blank white screen and the unit would shut off afterwards. I tried letting it dry out but the unit was just dead. After several days of the malfunction, while on the trip, I noticed some corrosion around the power plug port area and hinges. The seals seem a bit flaky in this respect. I made sure to rinse the unit off with freshwater after every outing.The kicker is that I had used this probably a dozen times in the saltwater without any problems. I'm thinking it's not as rugged as it's cut out to be. After considering how much I used it, I put it through a pretty good stress test overall. Unfortunately, it failed. Kodak support didn't seem very supportive of the issue - they wanted me to return the camera, at my expense, with a 7-10 business day turn around. I didn't really want to deal with the back and forth and an experience like that left a bad taste in my mouth anyway. I'd prefer not to be Kodak's QA dept.That said, the video quality is awesome with what I did capture, but I cannot recommend it to anybody with the problems I've experienced. Maybe it was just my unit, but with this experience I will generally be avoiding Kodak products in the future. This, along with so many other reviews of batteries not working and units not charging, is only proving that Kodak's QA process is shoddy at best.I would avoid this unit until Kodak makes major improvements to the ""waterproofing"" aspect as well as all other issues people have been reporting. Personally, I'm going to wait until more companies release comparable waterproof cams (and better reviews) before making such a purchase. My recommendation is this: be very careful with this unit if you plan on using it for a lot of swimming/snorkeling/underwater stuff - it only takes one time underwater for your camera to be destroyed. And also, be wary of the unit's ability (or lack thereof) in places of high humidity. Otherwise, I'd say it's a bargain camera for anything else. It just doesn't seem as ""rugged"" as it's cut out to be.An additional tidbit or caution to note while handling this underwater. Make *sure* you have a secure hold/grip on this unit or that you secure it well using the wrist strap or whatever you come up with. This thing will sink like a brick if you let go of it in the water! If I had brought it to the place we snorkeled where I brought my Canon (and let go of that...fortunately it floated), I almost surely would have dropped it to the bottom 30ft down. And I would have had a fun little diving excursion in that case. Not to mention, likely a dead camera as the rated depth UW is 10ft :T ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3160, 3174)"

Since I upgraded the firmware to 220, I have already rebooted the router about 4~5x, the internet connection suddenly stops. I don't know if it's just me, but I feel that the router is a bit warmer when I touch it using firmware 220. I don't have any temperature measuring device so I can't confirm that it's really warmer (I did not adjust the transmit power setting, fyi).Update (9/12/12):I updated the firmware to version 3.0.0.4.220, and the 2 previous problems I stated is still existing.. I don't mind it that much but I still hope Asus fixes it soon. Workaround for 1.) I connect my PC to 2.4Ghz. 2.) I use Splashtop from my iPhone to connect to my home PC from office.AiCloud looks promising, supposedly you could view/play your media files from your iphone/ipad and android devices within and outside your network. But I'm stuck with the loading page, after I put my login user and password. My iphone can't login. Can anyone confirm if the aicloud works?Update (8/30/12):So far have encountered 2 problems with the latest firmware (3.0.0.4.164)1. I'm using Nero Media Home 4 in my PC to share my media to my wireless TV, Bluray and PS3. When my PC is connected to 5Ghz, the tv, bluray and ps3 cannot connect to Nero. When I connect to 2.4Ghz, they can see Nero and play the media. This works fine with N66U.2. I have setup port forwarding for Remote Desktop Connection, so I can connect to my home PC from my office. It's not working. This again, is working fine with N66U.QOS is also a known problem, but I'm not using it for now. I believe it's just a firmware issue since both are working with N66U. I hope it gets fixed with the next firmware release.Original Review:I bought this to share my media files, from an external hard drive, to my 3d tv and wireless bluray in bedroom. So far I'm not disappointed. I also have N66U to compare with, I've read from other reviewers that this router gets hot, when I touch the top part, it is warm but not hot, which is the same with my N66U.This is suppose to have a greater coverage compare to N66, but to my experience, the coverage is the same, which is already awesome.Initial setup was very straightforward, easy, fast and CD-less. Below are the actual steps after opening the box:1. Connect LAN cable from modem, LAN cable going to PC, and power cable2. Open web browser. Router setup page automatically shows up. Click Next3. Type the User login and Password that you want. Click Next4. Type the SSID and key for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz (or you can click the checkbox: Copy 2.4Ghz settings to 5Ghz settings). Click Apply.After that, your wireless device should now be able to connect to your new router. I even used the same SSID and password from my previous router, and my devices connected automatically after the setup.These are my devices that connects to this router:- 3 laptops- 2 Iphones- Ipad- wireless tv- wireless bluray- PS3- wireless printerNo problem with connections, no disconnects, iphones when outside the apartment are still connected.PROS- Media Bridge mode. Applicable using 2 AC66U. This feature is not available to N66U- Dual band, 450Mbps+1300Mbps. I can't comment with the AC speeds, I don't have wireless AC clients for now.- HTTPS authentication when accessing admin page. If your using this for office/business use, this is plus.- AiCloud. Coming soon, the app is not yet available from the appstore/googleplay as of this review. (This is now available as of firmware version 3.0.0.4.220)- 2 USB ports. Supports external hard drives, printers or 3g/4g modems- 3TB external harddrive works (Manual says only up to 2TB is supported). Tested using Seagate expansion 3TB STBV3000100. My TVs won't even accept 3TB harddrives when connected directly to its usb ports.- DHCP Manual IP assignment (if you need static private IP on your device)- DLNA. Streams HD vids, pics and 3D vids to my LG tv and my LG bluray player, no lags, no disconnects. And this is even using wireless connection and not wired.- Awesome range. Before, I was using a cheap netgear, single band 2.4Ghz, included from my ISP. From the farthest point in my apartment, I get 2 bars of signal in windows 7 wireless network connection settings. With AC66U, I get full 5 bars using 2.4Ghz, and 4 bars on the 5Ghz band.- 3 Large external antennas- Download Master (if your into P2P downloading/uploading)- Option to vertically stand the router, or wall mount- User friendly setup- Impressive performance particularly on 5Ghz band- Stylish looks and superb quality- Ability to install 3rd party firmwaresCONS- Steep price (but worth it!)- Lack of USB 3.0 (not a big deal, since I don't get usb 2.0 speeds for file transfer using FTP or Samba, which I already know before purchasing this)- Manual is a bit helpful, but this router has tons of features and the manual only mentions the basic functionalities.If you got the money, and want a great performing router and stylish as well, I Highly Recommend Asus RT-AC66U.

B002NEGTTW,electronics,How is the learn curve?,"The EOS 7D, Canon's latest prosumer digital SLR, is a major step forward, incorporating some features found on the 5D Mark II, as well as some that are totally new to Canon's prosumer line.  With much that is new, even those familiar with Canon SLR's, should be prepared to spend some time frequently consulting the often confusing manual.Looking to upgrade from the 40D, I passed on the 5D Mark II, because its 3.9 frames per second shooting rate is inadequate for shooting sports.  With the new features and a shooting rate of 8 FPS, the 7D was my choice.  These are some early impressions of the 7D.Housing, Controls and Display:The 7D's heavy-duty, dust and weather resistant housing, is made of lightweight magnesium, and feels rock solid.  The 7D has a new arrangement of controls for users to get familiar with.  The mode dial is similar to the 5D Mark II (no 'Sports', 'Portrait, 'Landscape', etc).  The power switch has been relocated to behind the mode dial.  The video recording button is on the back, located on the right side of the eyepiece, similar to Canon's 'S' series cameras.  Shutter noise is quiet, similar to the 40D.  Image quality and color rendition on the LCD display is good, and looks similar to the 40D.  The display brightness can be set manually, or the camera will adjust it automatically.Pressing the 'Q' button activates the 'Quick Control Screen', a menu where a number of settings can be conveniently adjusted.  The joystick is used to toggle between functions, and settings are adjusted the normal way, using the Main and Quick Control dials.  Once you get used to it, the 'Q Menu' may become your preferred method for adjusting your settings.Autofocus:As I find that Canon's nine point focusing pattern is often inadequate, the 7D's improved autofocusing system was of special interest.  For those unfamiliar, the AF pattern is eight points in a diamond shaped layout with the ninth point in the middle of the diamond.  The new 19 point adjustable autofocus system basically adds points in the interior of the diamond area.  The actual area of coverage, does not appear to have increased.  Being center weighted is understandable, but expansion beyond the diamond area is arguably more useful than just increasing the number of focus points within the diamond area.The rule of thirds is a useful guide for composing an image, however attempting to implement this rule using the diamond shaped pattern is often difficult.  Say you want to focus on something in the top left quadrant of the frame.  One method is to lock focus on the area, reframe, and then shoot.  This works if the subject is stationary, however this method becomes more problematic for moving subjects.  If only there was a focus point nearby.  Increasing the concentration in the central area makes some sense, but I really wish they had expanded the overall area of autofocus coverage as well.That issue aside, performance of the new autofocus system appears to be a big improvement over the 40D and 50D.  The 19 individual points, are also grouped into 5 multipoint zones, which can be selected using  the Zone AF function.  This feature is very useful for many applications, like sports or group shots.  Shooting college basketball, focus lock using Zone AF was very good, much superior to single point focus.  The high speed continuous shooting mode (8 FPS) is smooth like butter.  The shutter button quite sensitive, but keeping the camera steady in burst mode takes practice.Remote Triggering and Wireless Flash:A very convenient feature that was a long time coming to Canon's prosumer line, is the ability to remotely trigger the 7D using Canon's RC-1 remote, or other inexpensive remotes.  The 7D can also be triggered by Pocket Wizards, via the N3 terminal.  The integral flash is essential, and the 7D also has the capability to wirelessly trigger compatible Canon speedlights, eliminating the need for the ST-E2 transmitter, and makes creative flash photography more convenient.Live View, Video, and Memory:Photography via live view mode, is similar to a point and shoot, although the 7D is a little heavy to be holding in front of your face.  As claimed by Canon, the image taken seems to be 100% of what appears in the LCD display.  I use live view for rough framing when the camera is on a tripod.  For HD video a fast card is a must, Canon recommends using a CF card with a transfer rate of 8MB/second.  Shooting video is simple, though the results can be kind of spotty.  Check YouTube for video reviews of the 7D, and examples of videos shot with the 7D.  Picture quality can be quite good, although skin tones may not be accurate, and AF is not continuous.  You will need ample memory to shoot video, as a 4GB card holds about 12 minutes of content.  For images at highest image quality (RAW + JPEG), the camera reads that a 32 GB card will hold about 960 images, an 8 GB card about 240, and a 4 GB card about 125.ISO:As the 40D tops off at ISO 1600, the 7D's ability to shoot up to ISO 6400 is mind-blowing.  The noise in test shots at ISO 4000 and above, were not bad.  I rarely exceed ISO 800, but it is something I will now look into further.LP-E6 Battery:Canon's LP-E6 batteries have a serial number, and the 7D will keep track of the battery's power level, and number of shots taken.  Canon continues to take measures to discourage the use of third party products.  Non-Canon versions of the LP-E6 battery will work in the 7D, but are not recognized, and read as `empty' on the battery meter, with no data available.  Having used non-Canon BP-511 batteries for years in various Canon SLR's, without any problems, I do not believe that they are inferior or dangerous.  You can pay $60 for the Canon LP-E6 if you wish, but you can get generic LP-E6 batteries for as low as $10.In these hard economic times, value and quality are even more important.  The 7D does cost more than the 40D and 50D when they debuted, but it is worth it.  The 7D is better built, has many more standard features, and produces better images.  It appears that Canon is very serious about competing with Nikon, which should benefit users of both brands.  It will take some time for most users to begin tap into the potential this camera offers.  Have fun taking some great images. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6285, 6299)"

With the mediabridge router the wireless signal was highly unstable on all my wireless devices.Once the user interface for the ASUS was dialed in, it prompted me to download the latest firmware - which was an effortless process - siimply following screen instructions. Now, I am also using QoS for browsing, HD media streaming, and gaming. This product really works the way a router is supposed to. Not to mention the physical aesthetics of the router, esp. when you put it up on the stand it comes with it -The Dark Knight look ;-). The wireless range is awesome - options for setting up guest ssids on both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands is an excellent feature. After using Netgear for about 10 years and the fiasco with the mediabridge router, the ASUS product's performance prompted me to write this review. I highly recommend this product for tech enthusiasts and novices looking for ease of use as well. You will not regret it! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1360, 1374)"

The camera size is large enough to grasp it, yet small enough to fit in a pocket. Really it is the size of most cell phones so one has to get used to keeping hands still while taking video/pictures.

Yes it is a good camera, and yes it will satisfy most first time SLR users needs. BUT BE WARNED, if you are planing to get serious there are better choices out there! I originally stated that I was able to shoot a number of sports (soccer, hockey, rugby) with no trouble, and I still stand by that. However even a couple hundred more dollars will get you the 30D and in my opinion its a way better deal. Its not quite as easy to use button and menu wise, but thats something you can get used to! The AF is way faster and quieter, the increase in fps is a HUGE advantage for sports, the body feels great (maybe not for small hands) and is heavier which provides balance when hand holding L series telephoto such as the 70-200 f/4L. I just recently used the 30D with the 70-200 f/4L for a collegiate soccer game and let me tell you the difference was amazing. Compared to the xti and 70-200 the AF was way way faster. It made all the difference, and  a lot more of my shots came out useable. If you have the extra money I would highly recommend the 30D over the xti. Ultimately go hold them both, but the 30D just feels better and more solid. If your shooting an elementary school game the xti is great, but if your planning on doing anything semi serious the extra couple hundred is worth it. I give this camera four stars because I wont deny that it is a a good camera, however I leave out the fifth star because it lacks that extra kick of the 30D and obviously more expensive cameras. Plus the shutter on the 30D sounds way better. lol. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1661, 1675)"

They had a bundle package with the tablet sleeve included for $239 (few bucks more than Amazon price after tax but you do get a 90 day exchange).I have to say so far I am very impressed with this samsung tablet.  Its very responsive to the touch seems very fast for what I need it for and the weight is great.  I had the Kindle Fire and I enjoyed it but I do like having access to the Google Market and figured if I need to read books I can always use the Kindle app for android which works very well. I will say the first samsung tablet I picked up I found a few ""lit"" pixels which showed up when using a black background. I took it back to the store and repurchased another one and so far I do not see the same issue.I think the camera even though its getting a bad reputation still is nice since the Fire does not even have one.  I don't see myself out taking snapshots with this thing but sometimes its nice having it and I might try Skype on it at some point.  So far the wifi has worked great, I downloaded about 800mb of music over iSyncr Wifi the other nite along with downloading apps from the google market and did not notice hardly any slow down.  I think for the money this is gonna be a great tablet.  I currently have an ipad 1st gen, Touchpad rooted with Android and a KFire.

Blurex leather slim folio case is ok, but I did not like how the case is when in the open position, doesnt lay flat.  The other one I tried is the MoKo 360 degree rotating case, which the concept is great, but the back of it seems rather large since it has the swivel functionality.

Now of course there is no camera hole in the back but all the other ports are fully accessible and this cases still allows you to pop out the corner to position the galaxy tab in landscape mode for reading.

So that left me with nothing, and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under $50 that I could. I looked at so many headphones, and i still loved my JVC's, but i decided i should probably try something new. and then i found these...I would say that I am...an untrained-audiophile of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones. i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to, but it doesn't exactly ""bother"" me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh, etc. That being said, i loved my JVC's and was sad to see them go, but I've gotta say, i love these bad boys even more. I think it's the bass that separates them...it's punchier and more...accurate, you know? without being overly done. out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance (i think that's the right word), but they've broken in a bit and it's less harsh in that range. but the bass...wow. otherwise they're very similar in my opinion to the JVC's. The treble might be a tad better, but not much if at all. I don't know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it, but that's my two cents. They're also very comfortable, not too tight or anything and very soft padding.

After going though all forums and troubleshooting pages, I realized that the firewall on my Macbook Pro is on, and that's the reason. When I disabled the firewall, it was set up in no time.But things got better after that grueling installing experience. I have hooked the Chromecast up to my LG 39LN5300, and it works (almost) perfectly. I use it to watch youtube, Netflix, or to stream (some) online videos using VidCast bookmarklet. From time to time, it doesn't work, but a simple reload of the chrome page almost always solves the problem. I also tried tab-casting, but it's not something to write home about. You can cast The Daily Show, or Colbert Report, but it only runs (almost) smoothly at 480p, and it takes a lot of CPU and RAM (you can hear the fan on Macbook Pro going crazy). The good thing though is that it also casts the audio to the tv. To be fair, this option is still in beta version, so hopefully it will get better with time.What is exciting about Chromecast is that Google recently released the SDK for developers, and they are doing a great job coming up with cool ideas (check out AllCast, for instance).

I don't understand all these people that buy the Fire HD to ""try it out"" and complain that it takes the Fire 4.5888888 seconds longer to load a screen than the nexus or ipad. Can you really not wait a total of 5 extra seconds for a device to load a page? I think if that is a deal breaker for you, perhaps you have bigger problems at hand.

The description provided by Amazon, the seller, was rather lack-luster.  Here is my summary of my thoughts-and-impression.1) Ordered Oct 22, arrived Oct 242) Ordered four (4), got four3) Arrived in a rather big box with contents flopping though no visible damage - combined with another order4) Flash Drive includes unmentioned SanDisk SecureAccess software (AES-128bit) that is a little out-of-date.  Should be at least AES-256bit and should use FAT32 at a minimum with NTFS preferred. It is a USB2 device.5) Testing flash drive (Win):a) root directory has two visible folders (club-application and SanDiskSecureAccess)b) root directory has two executable files (RunClubSanDisk.exe and RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exe)c) root directory has a hidden file autorun.inf (can be opened with Notepad if curious)d) flash drive packaging indicates WinXP, Vista, and 7 are supported as well as Mac OS X v10.5+e) Mac users needing security are directed to the SanDisk website's SecureAccess page (URL will be censored by Amazon) for downloadf) The club application was of absolutely no interest and the associated folders/files were deleted.  It is one of those, ""Get special offers from SanDisk partners"" RPIA's.g) The SanDisk SecureAccess Quick Start Guide is a PDF located in the SanDiskSecureAccess folder.  If the SanDisk SecureAccess process is something that has never been used, this provided guide would be a must to read - it is short.h) If I recall, correctly, the, unwritten, MAXIMUM, vault size is 4gb which is sufficiently large to hold the contents of one (1) DVD.  If compressed (ZIP'd) files are written to the flash drive, it is often possible to squeeze more than 4gb of uncompressed files into the 4gb vault space; however, this is way to subjective to give any ""reasonable"" percentage since compression depends upon the compression software and the file content being compressed (e.g. video, text, spreadsheet, document, database, etc.).i) Normally, I delete all of these provided tools.  If I change my mind at some future date, I can go to the SanDisk website and download the SecureAccess software. (If there is the curious streak, the older U3 software is also available that is more userfriendly and more out-of-date and does NOT use the ""vault"" concept.  Get both the install and the uninstall software if you think about using it.  BTW, you are, of course on your own though the support folks will sometimes answer questions.)j) If you do use the provided tools, do MAKE SURE the Closing your private vault instructions, on page 8 (English) are followed.  The flash like any plug-and-play device will mostly always be unaffected by just yanking from the USB port; however, the more important the information stored, the greater the chance the once-in-a-million ""oops"" corruption will strike.k) There is a place on the drive to attach a lanyard, or string, to keep loss at a minimum.  I am thinking the cap is a gonner since it does not fit all that securely; however, this comment in no way obviates the intended purpose of the device and how it works.  Just doNOT use peanut butter as a place to stick the drive to keep it from getting lost (you are going to have to figure out the reasoning for this comment).l) Did they work?It was curious that the thumbnail icon for the flash drives was that for the ClubSanDisk and not the SanDisk SecureAccess when it appeared.  It seemed to have a great deal of difficulty in displaying after the longer than expected recognition and driver-installation.  Specificially, the autorun.inf was configured for the ClubSanDisk.I changed my autorun.inf to the following (if you choose to do so, YOU do it at your own ""RISK!""):[autorun]action=SecureAccessopen=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeicon=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeWhat does this mean if the icon does not show?  Well, you may have to ""guess"" which drive letter is associated with your flash drive - no biggie; but, rather annoying.  For some reason, I got noticably slower access and usage, ""IF"" I had a USB3 device plugged into one of the available USB2 ports at the same time.m) Getting the little drive out of the packaging was an interesting exercise in frustration.  The first one I could extract ""almost"" using the cut line indicated on the packaging.  The second one required a little more effort since the cap was stuck to the packaging which required major surgery to get the clear plastic unstuck from the cap.  The third flash was a little easier to extract from the packaging though the cap did provide a moment!  The fourth drive packaging was cut on the bottom end and this seemed to allow easier extraction of the drive and the cap.  Also, then) Insertion and removal from a powered USB hub; and, the same for other USB ports was reasonably effortless due to the lanyard connector that offered a place to get a grip.o) The flash drive device is not realy designed, in my opinion, for a lot of insertions and removals from a USB port.  I always connect these ""cheap"" devices to a powered-USB port so any damage done by the device's connector only affects the easily replaced hub and does not damage my computer.Close, click ""eject"" ... and ... REMEMBER, it is better to be safe than be the ""did it to yourself"" victim because the ""Safely Remove Hardware"" icon in your tray was not used!

Well, the ones they both carried didn't have great write ups nor were they any cheaper than these Sennheiser RS120's from Amazon's seller Electronic Expo. Obviously, cost is important with out current situation. I'd never heard of Sennheiser. Left to buy by brand, I would have bought something familiar like Sony, but I kept reading good things about Sennheiser on every site I checked. The price was as good or better than the brands I had heard before. So I did rely heavy on the comments of others - thanks to you who posted. I am not an audiophile or techie at all.So now you know why I bought them, on to the headphones and how they work. In one word - excellent! I love, love, love them! I put them on and listen to the computer radio programs as I do housework and they don't disturb hubby from sleeping. Finally, once again I can enjoy what I want, when I want. I have only had them a month or so but I use them almost everyday from 1-2 hours, to all day long because they are compfortable enough to wear for hours, if I choose. Yeah, the ears will get a little warm but really not bad at all since they are not cupped over them. What little sound may escape doesn't bother hubby as I am not setting beside him when I use them and I doubt they would do so even then, because I don't have anything that close to my ears blasting. I have worn them out to the garage to load my truck with some things, out to the end of the house to the garbage can and even down to the end of the driveway which is about 175' long. I never lost my signal. I did get white noise louder than my signal only once and that was when I pushed the garbage can over to the side of the drive and I was underneath a powerline transmitter - duh - no surprise there was some interference there. But, obviously it only lasted a the few seconds it took to leave the garbage can there and then as I stepped away, the signal was clear again. My house is a ranch house, 65' long. The computer and headphones transmitter are literally on one end of it in the dining room we use as an office. The entire house and full length basement recieve a signal just fine. When I walk through a doorway, I occasionally get a little hiss or white noise mixed into the voices, but only passing through the doorway. The rest of the time is perfect. Performance is A+ for me.To be honest, I have not hooked them up to the TV nor Stereo, but all of the plugs you need to do so are included. I can say that on the radio talk shows I listen to they do occasionally play music coming on, going off, commercial breaks etc, and it sounds great. So, I am sure listening to CD's would only be better.If there are any negatives it would be the inability to tighten them just a little more. Thanks to reviews by others I was aware of this before purchase, however, I wasn't intending to use them for exercise so it didn't matter. It still isn't a big issue. I am only 5'2"" and have a pretty small head. Adjusted to the smallest size works well for almost every thing I do. If I am running the dust mop and bend over to pick up the cat's toy they are fine and don't move. Once I was bent over for a while as I was pulling out everything from the closet floor to clean in there and they slipped around. Not off, just off center of the ear. Had I not stopped and repositioned them, I suppose they could have fallen but it was not that big of a deal. I did find that a little of my hair had gotten between the headphones and my ear. If I make sure all my hair is pulled back before positioning the headphones on the ear they stay put better. I guess a cup style wouldn't matter but these do, so if you have long hair, make sure it is all out from between the headphones and ear.The only other thing I could say that it was lacking was better instructions. I may not be an audiophile but I figured out how to hook everything up simply by looking at it. I did learn things from posts however, I wouldn't have known otherwise. For instance, I received them, let them charge overnight and then when I tried them the sound quality was not good. There was a LOT of noise even close to the transmitter. From the review posts I had read, I was aware of the tuning button below the volume control which tuned in the signal. I didn't see anything in the packaging about that! Had I not known, I would have been dissappointed in the product. Knowing about it beforehand was great, I simply tuned in the signal and I was off to housework - happily once again.In conclusion, I cannot compare these to other wireless models, they are my first ones. But, I am VERY happy and for $59, I feel it was well worth my money. I would highly reccommend these to anyone. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5410, 5424)"
B009X3UW2G,electronics,How mano hours do you think is the battery life?,"Updated News as of November 2013:Google has released specifications for the Second Generation Nexus 7 with the release date on July 30th 2013. Resolution has been bumped up to 1920x1200 (323 PPI!), a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 (sorry, no S8) quad core processor clocking in at 1.5 GHz (vs the 1.3 Tegra 3 on the First Gen Nexus), 2 gigs of RAM, 4 times as powerful graphics chip, and a 5 megapixel back camera. Cnet is reporting that the Second Gen will have HDMI out capabilities from its micro usb port, thus implying the MHL protocols which were missing on the first generation are enabled on the Second Gen thus letting you plug your tablet into your TV to watch movies. The tablet is a bit lighter and a bit thinner than the first generation as well. Also ships with Android 4.3, the newest version. The dimpled back that so many people loved is gone replaced with a smooth surface.  Still no Gorilla Glass, but now includes Dual Band Wifi and stereo speakers. Battery capacity appears to have been decreased about 400 mAh most likely to fit inside the thinner case.Unfortunately, the price has increased. 16gb for $229, 32gb for $269 and the new LTE enabled model for $349. Unlike the First Gen series (which you are looking at), the cellular options now include Verizon in addition to the original GSM based AT&T; and T-Mobile. Sprint still out of luck. As always, sold unlocked. Due to the new release, the First Gen is likely to see significant price decreases.USB Hosting and USB OTG still works on the Nexus 7 2nd Generation.If you're on a budget, the Nexus 7 (2012) is an excellent choice, but for $229 the Nexus 7 2nd generation also known as the Nexus 7 (2013) is a superior product. Much better processor, better graphics, better screen and lighter.End of Update.I've had the Nexus 7 8gb since Late August. I'll share some of my experience as well as pitfalls. The 8/16/32 Gb are functionally identical abet with a few minor difference between them, largely being the size capacities. There is also a 3G cellular version for $300 on Google Play. Remember that currently Amazon is NOT selling the Nexus 7 itself, but merely providing 3rd Party sellers a place to sell it. Occasionally Amazon takes care of the shipping, but this is not an Amazon company product. It will be cheaper elsewhere.The 32 GB version was released on October 29th, 2012. The 8 GB version was discontinued and the 16 GB version dropped $50 in price. The 3G cellular version went on sale on November 13, 2012 only on T-Mobile and AT&T; networks for $300 big ones.A few things key to know about the 32 GB version:Flash memory works faster the more there is up to a plateau of around 480 GBs. Benchmarks on the 32 GB Nexus 7 show a slight improvement in speed in most activities. Meaning, despite having the same parts of its smaller sized brethren, the 32 GB will see a few seconds shaved off in terms of performance. The Nexus 7 8/16 versions were plenty fast already.Asus should have fixed many of the defects that plagued the early releases from screen separation, light bleed, bad audio plugs, etc. Sometimes it pays to wait for technology.Not all 32 GB are free for the user. Based on the previous models, you should have around 28 to 29 GB of empty space available.Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8/16/32gb (the three flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.It's called USB On The Go. You take a USB OTG cable (like $1 here or on eBay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16/32 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.Kickstarter recently funded a MicroUSB MicroSD reader which will allow owners of certain devices (including the Nexus 7) to access MicroSD Cards. Google ""Meenova.com"" for more information about when they are going to be released for the general public. This will function the same as an OTG Cable, but instead let you access MicroSD rather than USB Flash drives.If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Also be aware that apps that move other apps to SD cards in other tablets will not work with this. Apps such as App 2 SD don't do anything. I tried.As of today (11/19/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iPod Touch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 32 gb flash drive, a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad.Speaking of that issue: Game controllers and utilities such as Sixaxis and Stickmount (among other apps) require rooting. To those who are unsure of what rooting is, rooting grants the user access to the most bottom command line access of a device. Be aware this voids your warranty, risks turning your device into a very expensive paperweight and prevents auto updating of updates over the air. I learned this the hard way. Search on the XDA developer's website how to root, but research how to do it before attempting. There are benefits and disadvantages of rooting. Make sure that you know exactly why you are rooting.One CAVEAT to this, you have to use digital rights management free media. Mp3s are generally fine as iTunes is now selling DRM free as is Amazon. Direct downloaded movies are another story. You can also rip legitimately owned DVDs and downsize them for the Nexus. Those will play fine. Also, using other media players like DICE or BSPlayer will let you play formats that the Google Video Player doesn't like, like MKV or MTS.2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad 3 or 4 or a Nook HD (which by the way is gloriously beautiful). It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not take that-iPad well done, but save yourself lots of cash well done. It's fairly responsive, not quite iPad responsive, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. I honestly don't think people will notice the difference between the two in sharpness and text, but it is not as good in showing colors. That said, the Nexus 7 has a better screen then the iPad Mini. Go to your local Apple store, look at the iPad 4s and then the Mini. Prepare to be shocked. It's that noticeable.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixels is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app. One cool thing about the camera is that it does allow Face Unlock which takes a picture of your face and uses it as the unlocking mechanism for your tablet.4) Apps. The Apple ecosystem has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like Skype, Facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store via going to the Amazon App Store, registering your email and then opening the email they send you on your tablet. It's annoying but it works. One word of caution on the Apple selling point: according to a few studies, something like 60% of all apps on iTunes (roughly 400,000) have never been downloaded which gels with the economic data showing only a relatively few app developers actually make any money.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wi-fi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google ""Install Flash On Nexus 7""The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7. Flash is being phased out entirely by Adobe. It's not pretty on the nexus 7 but you can get it to work, especially if you need to stream Amazon movies.7) No home screen rotating - Not true! Update 4.1.1 fixed this. Home screen rotates now!Now on to other things:Performance:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network dead zones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn'tOh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.Operating System:Jelly Bean on the Nexus 7 isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with). Jelly Bean is more smooth than iOS 5/6 on my Nexus 4 though. Hardware seems to be the difference.The most recent update 4.2 allows multiple users accounts on the tablet (same as Nook HD) and 4.3 has added types of accounts, both full and limited. Limited allows a limited account to share the apps of a full user, thus eliminating the problem of having to buy apps multiple times. A limited account can also be limited in what apps are shared thus giving users some form of parental controls.Because this is a Nexus device, Google is pushing out updates regularly and you don't have the problem that many Android phones have in their carrier refuses to release updates. You'll have the most recent update of Google for the foreseeable future.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10"" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like ""do I need an umbrella today?"" Ask ""Weather forecast (your location).""Also Google Voice does not have the witty banter of Siri. For instance, asking Siri ""what are you wearing"" gets her to say ""Why do people keep asking me that?"" Google Voice doesn't do that kind of funny stuff.GPS & Directions:Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the ""NAvFree USA"" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying ""in 100 meters, turn right."" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Other:Widgets are small applications that sit on your home screens showing whatever you want. Right now I have weather, Settings controls, Youtube, Facebook and Salon online magazine. It's real nice to be able to look at your screen and get all the info you need rather than having to crack open an app or a browser. This is partially why Android web usages is much lower because there's no need to go to the Web to get information when it's right on your home screen.I previously argued that this device was awful for note taking. I take part of that back. While the screen is tiny, using a real keyboard either via OTG or Bluetooth isn't that bad after I spent a month doing it. I still suggest getting a real laptop, iPad or Galaxy Note 10.1, but this will do in a bind. There's no latency in typing like other Android products have seen. The Asus Transformer with keyboard has a real noticeable latency issue when typing so much so it's unpleasant to type. The Nexus 7 with keyboard can write as fast as you can.A couple things I noticed:1) Some apps will cause a restart after updating. Turning off auto-update in Google Play will speed up your device as programs are no longer sucking resources to update on their own.2) Android itself doesn't do a very good job of reallocating resources over time. I need to restart my Nexus 7 about every two to three weeks where I can let my iPad 3 go for two to three months without restarting. It's a minor irritant.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so.Especially if you're an Ender's Game fan. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(17308, 17322)"

The base is a bit flimsy but seems to work just fine.  The picture quality is excellent- and no more burn it like we had with the plasma.  Set up was a snap.  We don't have cable- so hooked up the Blu-Ray player and began checking out Netflix on it. After dealing with macro blocking and burn in with the plasma this was such a joy to watch!  The sound bothers me as it could be better and kind of ruins it... but after adjusting the equalizer and upping the base a bit- it does sound better... not great but tolerable till we purchase a surround sound system.

B004J3V90Y,electronics,How is the camera?,"Wow.  This camera is amazing.  This is my first dSLR camera and I might as well have never been taking pictures when I had my point-and-shoot.  I wanted a camera that was capable of actually taking useable pictures indoors and also have a touch of zoom on it.  This does both great.  I can't believe the quality and clarity indoors, even at night.  With hardly any lights on it can take crisp photos with ease.  I was able to zoom across a dimly lit 40-foot room, use the flash, and read the serial numbers off my camera's box!  Amazing.The standard flash seems to work pretty well.  I'll probably get an external flash eventually, but the one it comes with works great.  Seems to be pretty powerful.  I haven't tested it outside at night yet, though.I've only played with the video capabilities briefly.  You set it up by finding your focus point and then roll from there.  It keeps the focus well and only small adjustments are needed when depth in your focused subject changes.  Might take a little work knowing when and how to change the focus during some action shots but eventually the non-autofocus throughout the video could end up being a positive rather than a negative due to customizing capabilities.The camera seems solid, but very light.  I couldn't believe the difference between this camera and my dad's 60D (which had a smaller lens on his as well).  It seems significantly lighter.  I thought this was a great feature since I'll probably use the camera a lot on the go.The functions of the camera make sense.  While I'm just a beginner, there seems to be a lot of room to learn with the camera.  The ease of use is easy enough for my wife to follow without having to learn all the intricacies to shooting a manual shot.  Yet all the manual capabilities are there when you want it.The live view screen is large, bright, and crisp.  Very easy to read in any light setting.Overall, I LOVE the camera.  While I would probably love any dSLR just coming from a point-and-shoot, the features of this camera are what attracted me to it.  It is light, powerful, and easy to use with flexibility to grow.  With such a powerful sensor for pictures and 1080p video capabilities, I feel this camera will be in my bag for many years to come. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2246, 2260)"

It does a good job of holding my iPad in place and still has a very slim profile when everything is put together. I was actually pretty surprised by how slim this case/keyboard was when folded up. The keyboard was easy to setup and connect and the fact that you can adjust, remove, or separate the iPad case from the keyboard is great. The price point is decent ($50-$60) and although the construction is a little ""plasticky"", it does what you'd want it to do. There are a little kinks to work out like how stiff the hinge actually is, how protective the actual case is, and how firm the case holds for typing.Pros:-Case/keyboard combo with very slim profile-Adjustable hinge for angle adjustment of iPad-iPad swivels for portrait or landscape typing-Easy bluetooth keyboard setup and connectionCons:-Little too ""plasticky""-Probably not as protective as a dedicated case-Keyboard is smaller and takes some time to get used to-iPad isn't rock-steady when typing unless you place it in the keyboard's notchtldr; good case/keyboard combo but needs more protection and improvements to be prefect ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1331, 1345)"
B00F3SOHNU,electronics,Which camera do you want to use?,"Awesome tablet. I had an ASUS Prime tf201 with keyboard so i wanted to ugrade to something really fast. The Note is really nice. I like the speakers and volume (much improved from the asus). The lower home button is not so ideal, and you dont see in the dark the back button, after you press it there will be light on it. Feels like there is too much stuff running in the background. All apps closed and still more than one GB of ram are in use. Luckily this has 3GB. Screen resolution is great but so far i have not experienced yet a true hd movie with netflix or youtube. Battery time is good but mostly drained by the screen, so i keep it to lower brightness.

B0088CJT4U,electronics,Does the mouse have good options?,"Every now and then you come across a product that brings a smile to your face and this could turn out to be one of them. I know I will not be in a position to take full advantage of this router's features for a while because most of my devices lack 5GHz capability but in spite of that there is  no doubt it will help overall network performance. While it appears to be positioned at the modest end of the manufacturer's dual band router product line, there is nothing modest about its' usefulness.Using the resource mini-cd for the setup assistant application, basic installation was completed in less than ten minutes, not factoring in the number of individual devices I needed to reconfigure to identify the new SSID(s) and password(s).  In order to create guest networking, a firmware update from the TP-LINK's website has to be installed. It should be noted the downloaded files must be extracted using WinZip or WinRAR, which might encumber some casual users. If the intention is to continue to use the Assistant app, there also appears to be another firmware update required to coincide with the other the other firmware modifications, as I discovered when I lost connectivity and couldn't restore it via the CD copy.  I didn't download it as I have enough familiarity with router configuration that I had already decided to log onto the administrative page and make manual changes before I realized there was a fix available.With theoretical transfer rates up to 300Mbps over both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands which results in the published combined rate of 600Mbps,  the router has already proven to be a nice step forward for my home/ home office network even though most of my activity will remain on the lower bandwidth at `g' standard. With two detachable external antennas, I would rate overall signal strength as good but not outstanding over 2.4GHZ. On the alternate band, degradation to some problematic areas in my house was evident (and expected) yet tolerable without with use of a range extender or access point.On a laptop where I swapped the existing adapter for a dual band `n' standard adapter I experienced an immediate consistent increase from the customary 36 to 46Mbps I was used to to 84Mbps via 5GHZ. That will be beneficial for streaming music and video files and networked backups to and from my media server and NAS. I'm sure most users will also be aware the 5GHZ band will only be visible on devices with dual band adapter capability and network names have to be segregated. As expected, WAN transferal over either band was not improved significantly as ISP limitations come into play there although there did appear to be a slight improvement as interference from other networks in my area is minimal on the 5GHz band.Naturally, some of us want caviar at catfish prices so it would have been great if the router had gigabit ethernet ports but it does have a USB port for networking printers and storage devices , freeing up another ethernet port for another device. It also has a power switch, a convenience absent on many devices in this price range, and  wireless on/off switch which is convenient for disabling broadcasts when one is away but needs to leave the network running for some processes like scheduled backups to a networked storage device.One interesting thing was I swapped out my normal adapters for the TP-LINK WDN 3200 thinking paired products from the same manufacturer might marginally improve performance but it turned out the opposite was true. On a laptop and older desktop PC, signal strength was actually lessened by 20% I tend to believe that may be attributable to the adapters lack of external antenna. I did not try the USB type adapter with an external cord which could have impacted results by facilitating different angles. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3790, 3804)"
B00829TIEK,electronics,How do you like the drive?,"First off, don't be misled by the package, which says ""Flexible for all your needs: Use with both Mac and PC Computers - no reformatting"". In order to use with Windows, you do in fact have to download the HFS+ driver from the Seagate website and reformat the drive (at least, this drive wasn't recognized by my PC running Windows 7). Of course if you are a Windows-only user, you probably would not even consider this product because of the name ""Backup Plus for Mac"". (You'd probably get the sister productSeagate Backup Plus 3 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive (STCA3000101), which also costs less.) Also, I'm not sure if this Backup Plus for Mac can go back to Mac once it is reformatted for Windows. I got it for my Mac and was afraid to try it.For this Seagate drive, which is an upgrade from theSeagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 3 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STAC3000102, it has a much slicker look and a unique adapter compatible with USB, Firewire and Thuderbolt. It also comes with convenient software called ""Dashboard"" which lets you upload and download pictures and videos to and from social media, a feature a lot of casual users will appreciate. If you frequently upload media from different devices such as a smart phone, tablet, digital camera, and desktop computer to Facebook, Flickr, or wherever, and want them backed up, this software really makes your job easier. What is more, it organizes photos by creating folders of each photo album, timeline, cover and profile.On my Mac, I have three other external drives attached in addition to this one, so I decided to do a quick benchmark test. I timed the speed to copy 2.6GB photos from my Mac to each drive. I used the same USB cable and the same USB port for all four tests.

B005HMO6A6,electronics,How are the results?,Upon first opening the box I was impressed at the overall look of the case.  It is very slim but at the same time very sturdy case.  The ipad clipped right on and the keyboard connected right away with the bluetooth.  I have only been using the case for about a week now but have very few issues.  The keyboard works great and looks good enough that people don't believe it's not a laptop until I show them.The keyboard itself is fairly light and I carry around my iPad almost full time with the keyboard and use it like my old netbook.  The keys work great and the only issue I've had is due to limited space the right shift key is smaller to make room for the up arrow.  I find myself hitting the up arrow a lot when going for the shift but it is something minor that with continued use is becoming less and less.  The battery life is also great.  I charged the keyboard the recommended 6 hours when I got it and I have not had to charge it yet (5 days as I use it to write this).The mount for the iPad itself is pretty simple and connect by simply squeezing together the tabs.  The biggest issue I have with the mount is the option to slide it in and out.  You have to slide the lock to move it out (move iPad away from you) but it slides in without the lock.  If you have it out and push or move the keyboard it has a tendency to move all the way back in.  Tilting back and forth is semi difficult also but that may be it is fairly new and will loosen up a bit with continued use.My only other con is a personal preference due to the fact I'm a pilot and use the iPad in the cockpit so it may not apply to you.  When I take the iPad off the keyboard before the flight I now have to find a place to safely store the keyboard.  It is rugged but I don't want to just throw it in my flight back and have items pressing on the keys.I have not tried it yet but it does appear the top case is actually thin enough to fit into other cases to be used as a pilot kneeboard.Overall I am very satisfied with this case.  I don't think you will find another hard case or keyboard combo that will compete with the NT38B anywhere near the price range.  I highly recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND,ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2164, 2178)"

I enjoyed this kind of simple joy whenopening a new product, yet I think it's only possible when a companyprofoundly designs its packaging as well as its product; this makes it feel asif I am unveiling a mystery, and this gadget gave me this feeling!Here are the list of pros:Easy file transferring - just plugged it into USB port, and the new driveappeared on my desktop screen. Then I just dragged the files I wanted to copyout from the folder. I heard that there are some people having issues with themino's built in USB plug, but I did not have any issues. I even tried a coupleof different ports, and it worked flawlessly, although it seemed a bit heavyhanging the whole camcorder in my desktop's USB port (but it workednonetheless!). Things such as 4 port USB hub or USB extension cable wouldsolve the issue if necessary.Doesn't feel cheaply built - I love the brushed metal feel to it. It might bea bit heavier than other plastic camcorders, but it feels very nice when Ihold and shoot. The built quality is excellent and the whole unit feels quitesturdy.Compact - It fits perfectly even in my small hand, and I am still able tocontrol all the buttons in the back with my thumb. The size is smaller thanthe iPhone so the grip is very good to hold and shoot (and it shoots HD, whichthe iPhone does not).Touch sensitive buttons - very useful if I shoot outdoors, such as at thebeach or playground sandbox. There is no need to worry about sand graingetting stuck in between buttons and the body. And the touch sensitivity iswonderful.Basic accessories - It comes with a soft case and a wrist strap. The softcase is very useful when you carry it around.Bigger space and longer battery life - This camcorder is designed to shootlonger than the first generation mino HD; therefore, it has about 8GB ofmemory space and a 2 hour lasting battery life. It's more than enough memoryspace and battery life to shoot outdoor activities or events.HDMI out - It's kind of standard these days, so it's a handy feature when Iam anxious to watch the clips on the big screen tv. I simply connect directlyto the TV using a HDMI cable, and it works without any issues.Video quality - Typically, I would not expect a super amazing video qualityout of this tiny camcorder, but mino's 720p HD is more than what I expected.With good weather (enough light), the video quality is amazing, and I can'tcomplain, but under low lighting, I found the video quality disappointing.It's a common limitation of these type of small consumer camcorders, I think;therefore, I am not too surprised about this aspect.There is one thing I wish it came with:The lens cover - It would protect the lens from my kid and blocks dust whenit's not in use. There is, however, a protective glass (or transparent cover)built in, and I think it could be more practical, actually. I can just wipe itwith my finger or something quickly.Overall, this is the simplest and easiest HD camcorder. Settings are easy andthe control buttons are simple and self-explanatory. The only thing to worryabout is what to shoot. The price is worthy, and frankly speaking, I've beenquite content with the camera. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3258, 3272)"
B005CLPP84,electronics,How is the guy?,"The Roku media player is one of the best choices you can make when it comes to streaming media devices.  Being an early adopter (I own one of the first 2000 units sold in the US), and owning three Roku players in total, I can say that I am a heavy user and a true believer.  I love the freedom of choice in content the Roku player gives you, with over 100 channels to chose from, including the ubiquitous Netflix streaming catalog, access to Amazon's vast catalog of movies, Crackle, Epic, Break!, Pandora and many, many more.  Some channels are subscription based, while others are free.  However, the abilities of the newest generation of Roku players, the Roku 2, also support 3D graphics and gaming, presented in the form of the now-familiar, downloadable ""app"".  From simple games like Reversi and Mahjongg, to Chess and Angry Birds, the Roku 2 is poised to compete with the likes of the Wii, though that time may still be some distance in the future.  However, right now Angry Birds can be yours for free when you purchase a new Roku 2 player.  Who doesn't like Angry Birds, right?Compared to the original Roku player (now the HD model) and the 2nd gen XDS model, the newest hi-end Roku player, the Roku 2 XS, takes its place at the top of the line-up with authority.  The XS unit does everything the other Roku 2 players can do, plus it comes with USB and Ethernet ports, which the two lower end models don't have, though all models of Roku player are wireless capable.  In addition, with the XS model, you receive a motion control remote (think Wii), which can double as a game-pad when you turn it sideways.  To go with this fancy new remote, you also get a free copy of Angry Birds!  The remote control alone MSRPs for $30.00 if you buy one separately, making its addition to the XS package a real value, in my opinion.  Free Angry Birds is just icing on the cake.With a MicroSD card you can expand the storage capabilities of the Roku 2, allowing you to install more games, and presumably, other content in the future.  Best of all, this is a standard feature on all Roku 2 players.  I did have a little trouble inserting my 2GB MicroSD card the first time.  I figured out that you have to push the card into the slot a lot further than I was expecting, requiring a good finger nail to get it in far enough to click into place.  Once I got that figure out, no further problems using the SD card slot have become apparent.  You will be prompted upon boot-up to format a new SD card, which is the only way to tell you have a memory card installed, as far as I can tell.  After seeing the prompt to format the MicroSD card and confirmation of a successful format, you never see anything else about the MicroSD card ever again.  I assume mine is still working, but I have no way to tell.  It would be nice to see something in the settings menu regarding the external SD card, maybe showing used/free space and mounted/un-mounted status.The 2GB MicroSD card I am using (Kingston brand) was purchased with the Roku 2 XS and an HDMI cable directly from Roku.  I believe the Roku 2 will support larger than 2GB SD cards, but there is nothing in the documentation about it.  I am trying to get verification of this before I try a larger MicroSD card.As for performance, I couldn't be happier.  Content loads quickly and runs seamlessly.  I have a 6Mbps DSL line and have little trouble streaming from two Roku players at the same time, both using my wireless router for access to the Internet.  The Roku players take a little while to boot up, however, they pretty much stay on all the time, so this point isn't terribly significant.  On the other hand, none of the various Roku player models have an on-off switch, which I personally don't like.  I want to turn my electronics off when not in use.  I'd really like to see Roku add a power switch to their players.  I have my XDS player plugged into the back of my surround receiver, which in this case is a switched plug.  When I turn the receiver on or off, the Roku player also gets turned on or off.  The other players are plugged into regular outlets, so I actually have to unplug those to turn them off, which can be rather inconvenient where power outlets are not readily accessible.You can use multiple Roku players in your home without interference from each other.  Do be aware, however, that any Roku remote will work with any Roku 2 player.  This has positive and negative aspects, though I'd say mostly positive.  For the most part, there is little reason to have more than one remote at this time, but I fully expect games developed in the future to support multiplayer, making additional remotes a must for those interested in gaming on the Roku 2.  You have to pair the new remote with the XS, and I had trouble with this at first, but I think it's because there was another standard Roku remote in the room during setup.  After removing the batteries from the older remote and rebooting the Roku 2 XS, I was able to make a successful pairing using the manual pairing option from the settings menu.  The new remote works well for standard Roku menu controls, but it really shines when you try it out with Angry Birds.  It is a little twitchy at first, but you quickly get used to the sensitivity.  It would be nice to see an addition to the settings menu for adjusting the sensitivity of the motion controller, but it isn't too bad at its default setting.  With a little practice, you'll be flinging those birds exactly where you want them!Overall, the Roku players have been a great addition to my entertainment options at home.  There is room for improvement, but I believe Roku has the best product offerings even so.  From the first Roku player with nothing but Netflix, to the current generation of Roku players supporting Angry Birds, Roku has made a real winning multimedia product.  Streaming media is only just now coming into full swing, and the Roku players have made much of it possible from the very beginning.  I am the happy owner of three Roku players, and I love them all.  I would heartily recommend them to all of my friends and family, many of whom are already Roku customers. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6165, 6179)"

B007P4VOWC,electronics,What is the user interface like?,"I have the New iPad (aka the iPad 3) and my mom has the Kindle Fire so I have used that as well.  I would have to say that overall the Galaxy Tab 2 has worked great.  I received it about three days ago and I really like it.  I like my iPad but I always thought it was a little too big.  I liked the size of the Fire but I felt that the operating system on it was too limited.  I decided the Galaxy Tab 2 7"" looked right for the price.  It's $50 more expensive than the Fire and $450 cheaper than my 64GB iPad 3.  The screen is not as clear or bright as the iPad 3 and the video quality isn't as good as the Kindle Fire but I would say that it is not too bad.  Don't expect excellent video quality because it's not but you can't expect all the bells and whistles of a high end tablet for only $250.  I like the android ice cream sandwich OS.  It looks nice on this device and it's a lot different than Amazon's version of android OS on the Kindle Fire.  The interface is fairly smooth and intuitive.  I haven't really had much delay when tapping on icons or sliding the screen.  It's not quite as smooth and sensitive as the iPad but let's face it, if you are interested in buying the Galaxy Tab 2 7"" it is probably for the price and you have ruled out the iPad for that reason or because maybe you have one already.  I think the camera isn't too bad considering the Kindle Fire doesn't even have one.  It is front and back.  There is 8GB of internal memory with an expandable slot for up to 32GB micro SD card.  That is a plus over the Fire.  I find it easy to put music and movies onto the micro SD card, then put the card in the Galaxy Tab and it very quickly loads all of it onto the device to play.  Easier than using the iTunes software if you ask me.  The speakers on the Galaxy Tab are not as clear and crisp or even as loud as the iPad 3 but it gets loud enough for my taste.  The sound is better and louder with headphones.  With headphones it sounds pretty good.  The Galaxy Tab 2 is more portable than the iPad because if you don't carry a bag of some sort to put it in you can still fit it in your front pocket.  You wont be able to put much else in that pocket and it sticks out but you certainly can't do that with the iPad.  As far as android play store, I am new to it.  I'm used to iTunes but there are many of the same apps available on the play store.  There is a Kindle app so you can still read your ebooks.  As far as I can tell there is no way to play Amazon VOD for Prime members or otherwise.  You also can't really sync your iTunes purchases to the Galaxy Tab 2 either.  There are work arounds that allow you to put iTunes movies and music on the Tab but if that is something that interests you, you can always look that up.  Surfing the web is easy and you can use firefox or opera if you want.  I have read some reviews that say surfing the web on this tablet is slow but I have no found that to be the case.  Web pages don't load quite as fast as the iPad but they load pretty quickly.  I also read reviews about how the wifi connection isn't as strong on this device as it is on other tablets.  That appears to be the case but it really hasn't resulted in slow internet speeds for me; and my internet provider doesn't provide me with very good upload and download speeds.  Overall for the price I would say this is a good tablet.  You can get a few cellphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note or the upcoming SIII for $200-$250 that are like this tablet but with better specs.  However, that is the price you pay if you have an upgrade available otherwise without an upgrade you will pay retail of $500-$550.  I think that even the Galaxy Note's 5.3"" screen is a bit too small for a tablet though.  The 7"" screen is just right for an extra-portable tablet.  I would recommend the Galaxy Tab 2 7"".

B000062VUO,electronics,How is the speaker clear?,"Let me preface my review by saying that I am no ""audiophile.""  While I do have electrical engineering knowledge and understand many of the specs that can be compared amongst speaker sets, I cannot discern some of the subtle differences that true audio technicians can.  On the other hand, I am also picky about sound quality and am able to immediately notice many aspects of speaker design based on how they affect the sound of a song.With that said, my appraisal of the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 system is a 5-star rating.  These high-quality speakers are excellently designed, admirably built, and deliver outstanding sound quality whether they are used with music, movies, or video games.First off, the speakers themselves are wonderful.  Featuring strong midrange drivers and bright ""horn style"" tweeters (a Klipsch tradition), they deliver the full range of frequencies contained in a typical audio track.  In this regard they surpass competition such as Logitech, which lacks good midrange abilities.  The Klipsch speakers are good enough to draw out flaws in lower quality audio tracks, which can be mildly annoying, but is a great testimony to the quality of the drivers and filters.Now, the subwoofer.  I demand GOOD bass from my music.  I hate deafeningly loud, boomy bass units that obscure the higher frequencies and irritate everyone within a half mile radius.  On the other hand, weak bass drivers that rattle and vibrate or distort when the music is turned up are also an abomination.  The Klipsch subwoofer, which runs at 50 watts continuously and can peak at 130 watts, is perfect for in-home audio use.  While it probably would not be sufficient to overcome road noise in a car (I have a 150 watt subwoofer there), it is more than ample for a home theater system.  I absolutely love the sound of the bass from this thing; while it is ported, which generally makes for boomier bass, the Klipsch unit does deliver very tight, clean bass.  A former roommate who was arguably much more of an ""audiophile"" than myself even commented with approving surprise about the great resonance the sub has at low frequencies.  Again, this sub might appear to be weak at only 50 watts RMS, but it is MORE than sufficient.  If you turn up the volume loud enough to start distorting or rattling the subwoofer, you will be completely deafened by the satellites.Features are where the Klipsch speakers lose a few points from the overall rating...but not very many.  Like most computer speakers, they feature a decently lengthy input cord (1/8"" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack), headphone port, and volume adjustment on the primary satellite.In addition, three features stand out as especially nice.  First, there is an additional input port (female 1/8"" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack) which means you can play music and video games at the same time, for example.Next, the speakers are connected to the amplifier/subwoofer unit via detachable 2-wire speaker cords, NOT hardwired cords.  This means you have a lot of flexibility in the placement of the units; additionally, the included wires are very long.  If they aren't long enough, you could also solder an extra length of ordinary speaker wire to the amplifier end because they simply clip into place.  The satellite ends have 1/8"" jacks on them which plug firmly into the back of the satellites.Lastly, the subwoofer can be fully adjusted via a knob on the primary satellite, meaning you can turn it down or even off without affecting the volume of the music.  This is great in apartments and dorms where the bass is OK during the day but must be toned down at night to avoid disturbing people.The one feature of the set that is NOT a plus would be the placement of the power switch.  In order to prevent that awful popping noise that occurs when you power up a speaker set remotely (such as by flipping the switch on a power strip), you'll want to use the unit's built-in power switch.  Unfortunately, this is located on the back lower part of the amplifier/subwoofer, under the wiring connections and generally in a place where you will have trouble reaching.  Usually, the sub gets tucked away under a desk or in a corner, and thus the switch location is rather terrible.  Logitech systems, for example, often have a remote or hardwired control pod which includes power and volume controls.Build quality on the speakers is also a plus.  The subwoofer is sturdy and rugged MDF, with a quality black coating and a firmly attached rear amplifier panel.  The satellites are injection molded plastic, but it is thick and strong, and the bases (which can be removed for optional wall mounting) are coated metal.  I have had the speakers for several years now and they have never once acted up on me or required repair.All in all, the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 set is a phenomenal, spectacular set of speakers for a relatively cheap, 2.1 style unit that was designed with computer audio in mind.

As far as fit goes, I am very pleased with the comfortable fit of the buds that fit into my ears nicely.I use these mostly to listen to a radio while drifting off to sleep. At this moment I am listening to music from my laptop. The separation of sound with earbuds is excellent, while the quality of the sound experience is only average at best, about $6.50 worth. The sound is thin as if there is no bass and treble is turned up to its highest setting. After fiddling with the settings on the laptop, I attained some improvement but the sound was never more than just adequate. Of all the songs I sampled, Lather by Jefferson Airplane sounded the best.These phones are great for someone like me with a little dog who chews up headphones with regularity. Audiophiles will have to spend more money for some auditory satisfaction.Another thought - I must say that the wires on these buds are easier to untangle than on past headphone sets.

B00GP4BVTO,electronics,How about profile?,"The New Trent Airbender Air Clamshell Bluetooth keyboard case for the iPad Air is an improvement over  many of the older models for previous iPads. The keyboard continues to be easy to use even in big hands. One complaint I had with my old keyboard was a lack of cut, copy paste functions. Well now I have them and they work well for my purposes. Also included are function keys for brightness, volume, music/video play options, and home screen or locking the screen. They all work well and make navigating easier.The case itself has a nice look and feel to it. The case doesn't feel cheap or too plasticky. As the name suggests its a clamshell design, that remains as one unit, with a swivel arm that allows for you to display the iPad in either landscape or portrait positions. The arm has a nice strong feel to it, since it is made of metal rather than plastic. The arm could use a lock that keeps the iPad at the user's perfect pitch, but the pitch at the fully extended position feels fine to me.Easy bluetooth connection, and great battery life make this a great keyboard. I have had for about 10 days now and have yet to plug in for my first charge. One feature I am happy to see is the bottom of the case doesn't prohibit you from being able to utilize the lightning adapter for old 30 pin products. I happen to have one of these and use it for charging while traveling.Overall I like this keyboard, but I have had the opportunity to also use New Trent Airbender 2.0 for the iPad air as well. While I do like the look and feel of this version, I am much happier using the Airbender 2.0 due to the ability to detach the back of the case from the keyboard itself. If you are someone who mostly uses their iPad with a bluetooth keyboard often, this may be the way to go, otherwise if you are like me and want a functional keyboard at times, with the ability to leave it at home and still have a case for your iPad, think about the Airbender 2.0.

B002RL875A,electronics,Which button we have to push to start the device?,"I purchased the Harmony One remote to replace my two year old Harmony 880 remote. The 880 had been having significant problems with the Volume/Channel Up & Down buttons, and I'd heard that wasn't an issue in the Logitech Harmony.Setup was a snap, as I was able to import the settings from my old remote to this one.  I like the look and feel of the remote.  It's easy to use and the buttons are easy to depress. The backlighting is a very nice feature. Also, the remote sits snugly in its cradle, unlike the Harmony 880, which took careful pressure in order to get it to charge properly.The touch screen works pretty well, but it's easy to accidentally press the wrong button if you aren't looking closely.My main issue with this remote was: about 30 days after I got it, I noticed the ""off"" button was getting harder and harder to press.  I contacted Logitech and they promptly sent me a refurbished remote as a replacement. I appreciated the quick response and that I wasn't required to send my old remote back (they just deactivated it in the system so I can't make updates to it), but that doesn't change the fact that I only had a new remote for 30 days before I had to settle for a refurbished one.

B0074BW614,electronics,Why is it a good hardware?,"This is my first Fire, so please bear in mind that I cannot contrast/compare to the Kindle Fire (traditional). I have numerous other Kindle e-readers, and work with numerous other Android and Apple tablets on a regular basis.First impressions - when it arrived today, it looked very sleek. Well-packaged, easy-to-open (unlike reports of the Nexus 7). No power plug, but I have it charging as I write this using a standard USB charging kit. Please note that if you plan on charging this device, you will (preferably) need a USB power adapter that supplies a full 2 Amps of current (or better). Otherwise, the unit will take forever to charge. And by forever, you can just check the FireHD's site out - 13 hours. Yeah. More than all night. No thanks. :) I personally believe that not including such an adapter was a wise cost-cutting move on Amazon's part... many of us already have a 2A charging adapter from other tablets/etc, and it cut $10 off the cost of the unit (or $20, if you didn't buy Amazon's special charger when you ordered the FireHD). By the way, my particular FireHD came charged to 68%.The size is perfect - it's got a good, solid feel, as well. Not too heavy, but heavy enough to let you know it's not a toy. The back is a nicely-textured matte finish. I don't like larger tablets that much, since it obviates one of the major advantages of a tablet in the first place (mobility). At iPad/Transformer sizes, I start to wonder why the person didn't just have a Netbook or regular laptop.Setup: The FireHD comes, as all first-bought Kindles should, pre-registered to your Amazon.com account. After power-on, the device asks for a wireless network, a timezone, and (optionally) Facebook/Twitter integration. That's it. Then it gets to the carousel/shelf interface and is instantly linked to your account's purchases. All my latest books, music, and videos were there, even those purchased earlier today, along with a Kindle Fire Welcome Guide. The device automatically updated itself after the first sleep I put it in.Incidentally, before the device arrived, I had pre-registered to remove the ads, for $15. From what I have heard on other Kindles, the ads are actually not very invasive or annoying, and actually can help pay for the Kindle over time through reduced prices or coupon offers. Me, I prefer an uncluttered and un-advertised-to interface, so I opted out. I think it was absolutely excellent of Amazon to offer this option in response to those who wanted out of that, but I would have been fine with them being there if there was no option to turn them off.Screen: The screen is gorgeous. Here, Amazon has learned from its competitors, who on their tablets used an application where the LCD panel is laminated/applied directly to the back of the cover glass. This allows the FireHD to have a clear, crisp screen no matter what the viewing angle. When I first powered the unit on, I cringed for a few seconds because it felt like the screen was too small - like I would feel cramped. This, however, was absolutely not the case, once the Kindle was active and into all the content, it was very open and inviting. I can only imagine how big the 8.9"" would be!In terms of usability for the touch-like nature of the display, this is the best tablet thus far I have ever used. Even light presses register properly. Many other tablets I've used are very particular about how hard you need to press or linger before registering. And yet, even with the ""hyper-sensitivity"" this device has, I have yet to have it register anything false (wrong button pushes), which are another hallmark of other tablets. Bravo, Amazon.Apps: The fire comes pre-loaded with OfficeSuite (a free version of a larger suite for editing documents), the Silk web browser, a Calendar, and various other supporting apps for things like Email, Contacts, IMDB, and Help. I like that they kept the initial load relatively free of bloatware (MOTOROLA: TAKE A HINT PLEASE!!!). I personally do not like the lack of some applications on the Amazon App Store... for instance, I would have liked to load Firefox or Chrome, but they are not there. Also, a link for Skype is on there but the app is not pre-loaded.Books read well on this, and this being my first Fire, I like the interface for reading books, though I definitely prefer e-readers for eyestrain reasons. It's nice that the FireHD has text-to-speech, especially since the PaperWhite lost this functionality (which I think was a great move; that device is an e-READER, not e-audibleprovider). The three backgrounds should help users with some of the eyestrain for limited periods of reading.I have not yet connected this to my corporate Exchange servers, and quite honestly I may not bother. But it's nice to know that's an option. Email for Gmail works well, with an occasional ""stutter"" to the interface while it's loading something from the web (see my comment in the next paragraph for Performance). I doubt I will do much email from this device, but again, it's nice to know that it's there, in a pinch.Performance: The processor is fast. It's not perfectly smooth, but reasonable. The vast majority of the lag, from what I have seen, revolves around network operations. Basically, if a screen has to load an image, or some other content, from the Internet or Amazon, the device can, and will, ""stutter"" occasionally. I guess there could be adjustments done to the interface to avoid this, but the fact is that to me, it isn't distracting from the experience. Temple Run and various other games run very smoothly on the device. I know it's about to sound harsh, but I would expect nothing less from an Android 4.0-based device. :)The storage (I got the 16GB version) is adequate for what I will use it for - mostly media streaming from the Web, plus some locally installed apps, games, and side-loaded books. Anything else will be on the Cloud. If you're a heavy movie watcher and want them loaded on the device itself (perhaps you would use this on a bus or commuter train), you may want to wait until October for the 32GB version; the $50 difference would be worth it, then.Wireless: Out of the box, Bluetooth is disabled (which is a good thing, don't want anyone hacking our precious new toy, now do we?). Since I have not been able to get Flash, I cannot benchmark the wireless (TWCable and Speedtest.net use Flash). Huh, now I know what it's like to use an Apple product. :) However, all file transfers happen as fast as most other wireless hardware I have around the house, and video streaming of HD looks crisp and clear. Video playback looks clean and the controls are easy to use.Buttons/Interface: I don't like where they placed the camera on the device. I personally think it should be on the other side, so that the camera is ""up"" when put in a case that allows for stand-up (though, this might be my case - but I don't see how they could have easily engineered around it). The camera provides a good, clear picture for video conferencing after a brief Skype test, and appeared to operate fairly well in low light, which is encouraging for me, since many areas in my house aren't adequately lit (hence my additional order for a Kindle PaperWhite :)). The interfaces on the unit are the speakers (which are decent, but don't expect huge bass or amazing sound from tiny speakers), USB and HDMI out (THANK YOU AMAZON! The HDMI interface, ALONE, should sway folks to this platform over other tablets!), the headphone jack (which is well-placed, not too near a corner and not recessed as early iPhones were), and the power and volume rocker buttons.Quite honestly, the only poor thing about the device is the power and volume rocker buttons. They are flush with the chassis, have little gap between them and the chassis, and are the same color as the chassis (black). This means that, every time I sleep the unit or adjust volume, I'm squinting at the top of the Fire to figure out where the heck the buttons are. While it is, technically, possible to ""feel"" your way to the buttons, it's impractical - since the volume rocker buttons have a tiny raised edge which ""announces"" their presence, but they are not differently-sized (smaller nubbin for ""lower volume"", larger nubbin for ""increase volume""). I think that, in time, the power button will be easier to find, since it's smack-dab-in-the-middle of the top, but for now, it's kind of a hunt, especially with a case on. I would have preferred a raised button. But believe me, this is a very minor complaint on an otherwise excellent interface implementation.Here's where the ""religious war"" starts. First off, I refuse to compare tablets purely on a hardware basis as, inherently, a contest of ""this one is best."" That's a technological no-win situation. Also, I firmly believe that, as a technology, tablets (of all kinds, not just the FireHD), since their inception, have been a solution looking for a problem. They are jack-of-all-trades, master of none. They are neat gadgets, but in and of themselves, they cannot do a tenth of what an average Netbook or laptop computer is capable of, and with current price points for decent laptops in the $400-500 range, it's hard to justify a tablet based on hardware alone. And I'm glad that Bezos and others at Amazon ""get"" this - I can't tell you how many friends and family members I know that own tablets, and never use them - because they want a keyboard and mouse.Here's where the FireHD shines. I think that the perfect niche for a tablet, where it can have a chance to be a ""master"" as opposed to a ""master of none"" - is in the singular application of being a multimedia consumption device. When a user wants to read a book, listen to music, watch a movie - they want a simple, point-and-shoot interface. And a tablet provides not only the interface, but the mobility.Conclusions:I feel that the FireHD is really what tablet users should be looking for. We should be looking at a device that provides easy, mobile access to an ecosystem of rich media, with features and accessibility that make it easy to use and enjoy. The Amazon ecosystem is amazing - having been a Kindle e-reader user for years, and now a Prime member with all the media perks that entails, I love how the media I purchase is available anywhere, on any platform. I think this device is a perfect complement to that experience; especially with the HDMI-out and Bluetooth capabilities, which allow this device to be a multimedia powerhouse at home or on the road.The only ""downsides"" I see in this device are the slightly-difficult-to-address buttons, the lack of an option to remove/disable the carousel, a Collections for Books feature (after 100 books, it's tough sometimes to organize things and find what you want to read), and the ability to set a custom screen background while on sleep. Since three of these four are software-based, I'm hoping they can be addressed in future software. In the meantime, these do not significantly impact my enjoyment of my device.Anyone seriously considering a tablet, especially one that takes full advantage of the Amazon ecosystem, should be considering this device. It is solid, performs well, and has a rich set of features that a $199 price tag makes all the more amazing. I think that, for $200, you would be hard-pressed to find a better way of enjoying Amazon's content offerings.(By the way, after finishing the typing of this review, the device is at 92%, which is awesome charging speed. It's great, again, that Amazon doesn't force you to use their chargers, unlike SOME OTHER manufacturers. :)) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(11580, 11594)"

I asked to return this item but Medialink would not accept returns after 30 days.  They offered to replace the router and even the 2nd one they sent me was unstable.  I wouldn't have written a bad review if they had let me return the item, but now that I'm stuck with a $50 paperweight I felt the need to write one to warn other potential customers.After spending way too much time with trying to get the router to work, I ended up going back to my Linksys Wireless-G router.  I get higher speeds with the old Linksys with a stable connection.  Originally I wanted to go with a Wireless-N router for additional range but I'd much rather have a stable connection with slightly less range than a crappy connection with more range.After reading some of the comments on the very positive glowing reviews, I'm a little wary about the actual reviewers of this item.  Looking at some of the top reviews, their first reviewed item was this Medialink router.  To me that should have been a huge red flag, but I was blinded by the $50 price tag for a wireless-N router.  I hope you do some research and look at the top reviews and see what else they've reviewed.

B004T9RR6I,electronics,How is the service performance?,"My trusty many-years-old WRT45G seemed to be going out every now and then so it seemed the right time to switch out. Right away, I noticed the range and speed were lower than what I was used to with the WRT45G. My wireless laptop would get 4-5 bars connection strength with the WRT45G, with the E1200 I get 3-4 at most. My download speed fell 6 Mbps (!) according to the speedtest website, though my upload speed was unaffected - I don't download a terrible large amount of stuff or run multiple internet reliant applications at once so this does not have too much impact on me personally at the moment, but it might concern me over time if I increase my internet usage and the speed loss becomes an issue. I know the loss in speed is due to the new router since when I reconnected my old router the speed went back up. There might be settings to ""tweak"" that would improve the speed, but I am admittedly not particularly tech-savvy, and as far as connecting routers go, I follow the basic instructions and leave it at that since it seems to have worked for me that way all these years. The E1200 also runs warmer than my WRT45G. The temperature is not enough to concern me about being ""too"" warm, but it is noticeable, vs what I would call the ""not worth noticing"" temperature the WRT45G used to run at. The E1200 is actually the piece running warmest out of all my Internet devices (Cisco CM100 modem, OBi110) I leave on 24/7.The only real advantage the E1200 has for me over the WRT45G is the appearance. It is nearly 1/2 as thick and much more appealing to look at without the antennae and sleek black exterior. The E1200 router has worked steadily without issues, but since I don't need to worry about appearance so much since I stick all my devices where they can't be seen, I would rather stick to the old WRT45G.One word of advice for when you're setting up the router for the very first time - make sure not to plug the router in and/or connect any cables until you get to the screen (after inserting setup CD and launching) where it tells you to do so..

The highs, mids, and bass are crisp and clear. When listening to my collection of SACDs and DVD-Audios, I was totally blown away. Even listening to CDs made me feel like I was hearing my music collection for the first time.

They are very comfortable, breathe well but produce an outstanding sound.I listen to mostly hard rock, some country and classical. I suppose these phones wouldn't be perfect for rap and really bass heavy music - but if you're listening to that, you're probably buying different phones anyway.Highly recommended!

B0074BW614,electronics,How would you describe the build of the camera?,"I was an early adopter of the original Kindle Fire in November 2011. I loved the Fire, but it was a bit clunky in some tasks, and it sadly lacked some desirable hardware features. I'm happy to say that I've had my Kindle Fire HD for a few hours, and my initial impressions are very positive. Clearly, Amazon listened to customers and addressed many of their comments. For starters:1. There's an external volume control. This was my single biggest gripe with the original Fire.2. There's a built-in microphone. That means you can Skype and use cool apps like Soundhound and Shazam. With the front-facing camera, you can do video Skyping, which is a big plus. The lack of a microphone or mic input was my second biggest gripe with the original Fire.3. An HDMI port means you can connect your Fire HD directly to most TV sets. I have a Roku, so that's not as big of a deal to me, but the HDMI puts the Fire HD out in front of almost every other tablet. I definitely want to try streaming Amazon instant video to a hotel TV the next time I travel.4. The video is noticeably crisper for videos.5. Bluetooth is a great new feature. It opens the possibility of wirelessly connecting the Fire HD to a myriad of products. I've been using a small, portable Bluetooth speaker to amplify my original Fire's sound. That works, but only with a cable connecting the Fire and the speaker. With the Fire HD, it only took a minute to activate the Bluetooth, find the speaker, and pair it with the Fire HD.6. The sound quality is very noticeably better. So far I haven't encountered an MP3 or video where I had to strain to hear, and oftentimes I'm having to back down on the volume.7. The web browser appears to be a little faster, although I won't really know how much faster until I upgrade my wireless router to a newer, dual band model. The wi-fi reception is quite good. When I connected the HD to our home network, the HD detected ten other networks in near-by houses, which is more than our laptop PC can detect.8. In the original Fire, using the graphic handles to select text was awkward and not always very responsive, especially with text in emails. The HD appears to have improved considerably the ease of selecting text.9. Unlike the original Fire, the memory is not partitioned, so it appears you can use all the user-available memory (12.63 GB) for anything - books, video, music, photos, etc. This is a big improvement.10. The virtual keyboard has been restored to something closer to the original Fire. Once again, there are separate periods and commas, so you don't have to hold down the period to type a comma. This was a real improvement.11. Text-to-Speech for books has returned to the HD. There aren't any settings - the voice is either on or off, and there's only a female voice - but it sounds more like a human voice and less like a computer than before.The HD was delivered already registered to me, so about all I had to do was connect with my wi-fi, set up my Gmail account (less than one minute) and set my favorites for the web browser, then download some of my books, magazines, videos, and apps from the Cloud. With 8GB of memory in the original Fire, I often had to delete apps before downloading any new apps. With 16GB in the Fire HD, that's much less critical.Because the size is different and the controls and ports have been moved around, cases for the original Kindle Fire won't work. The padded envelope sleeve that I had for the original Kindle Fire does work, although it's not a perfect fit.One annoyance: the Kindle Fire HD displays color advertisements on its lock screen, so every time you turn on the HD, you see advertisements for a Kindle e-book, a video, Amazon MP3 music, and such. Amazon has announced that owners can opt-out of the ads for $15. After using the HD for a few days, if the ads are too annoying, I may opt-out. Update: Apparently only the rotating lock screen ads can be removed by opting out. The targeted ""suggestions"" that show up when you're in the Amazon Store won't go away, so I don't know if it's worth $15 to opt-out. You'll have to decide that. You can do this at any time from your ""Manage My Kindle"" page.Invariably, the Kindle Fire HD is going to be compared to the Nexus 7, its closest competition in size, performance, and price. The HD weighs 13.9 oz. vs. 12 oz. for the Nexus (the original Fire weighed 14.6 oz.). That weight difference is at least partially offset by longer claimed battery life: 11 hours for the HD vs. 8 hours for the Nexus. Screen resolution is 1280x800 for both tablets (the original Fire's resolution was 1024x600). Most of the new features of the HD, like the front-facing camera and the microphone, are common to both tablets, but the HDMI port on the HD is a very nice feature that the Nexus can't match. I've used a Nexus 7, and it's a wonderful tablet, but based on my initial impressions, my slight favorite is the Kindle Fire HD, mainly for its ability to stream Amazon instant videos (which the Nexus can't, at least not without some finagling).Overall, the HD appears to be a worthy successor to the original Kindle Fire.-------------------------------------------Update (September 15, 2012):* At first, the layout of the various screens is somewhat different from the original Fire, but after playing around for a while, I'm getting used to it, and learning how everything works is pretty intuitive.* I'm reading on forums that some folks are having problems running some of the apps they had on the original Kindle Fire. For example, I'm having problems with MapQuest - it starts up, but crashes within a minute or so. It's probably just some glitches that will be fixed with the first OS upgrade.* The power button and volume control switch are flush with the case. It's not a big deal, but I wish they stuck out a millimeter or so to make it easier to feel them.* The original Fire was noticeably rectangular, so I used it mostly in the portrait position. The HD is more square, and it seems more natural to use it in the landscape position. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6043, 6057)"

I was sans electric for four days during Sandy and I could still read and email. Not only that but getting all comfy under the covers with it is akin to the flashlight `forts' we used to make as kids. It is very easy to figure out, usable right out of the box and then, with apps, highly configurable if you are into that sort of thing which I am. The color is brilliantly crisp and clear and the audio is great although I have only listened to books on it so far, no music. I splurged on the leather cover - horrendously overpriced - and carry it with me in my purse everywhere I go.I do wish it had an app like the iPad one where you hold it up to the sky and see the constellations above you in real time but that is the only area of disappointment. There have been so many times when I am reading a book and just stop and wonder at what a truly marvelous device this is, how far we have come so quickly. I just finished a sequel to a book published a few years ago and thought when I read the first book it was a book, a book made out of paper and that, at that time, I had not envisioned I would be reading the sequel on such a magical device.So many of my friends, fellow retirees, still struggle with their computers and are baffled and helpless as soon as something goes wrong.

B003ELYQGG,electronics,Is a brittle plastic?,"First off, for those giving this item poor reviews for quality: you know these are $5 headphones right?I think it's a great brand name product for $5, which is hard to find in stores such as Target and even Walmart. (Unless you want brands you never heard of) Anyway, the sound and bass is good, I heard things I didn't hear with my old headphones. Also the fit is great, it comes with 3 different sizes for comfort which comes in handy when going to the gym. I went through my normal routine with no problem, although haven't tested it on the treadmill yet.One minor, minor complaint: even on low volume, it's hard to hear what's going on in the background because of the shape of the headphones in your ears. (Basically ear plugs) It's great if you ONLY want to listen to music, but if you still want to listen to the background, it's very difficult.I'd still give these headphones 5/5 if it were $10.Update: After about 3 months, the sound sometimes cuts in and out when the wire changes position.

B000IBNXX2,electronics,How is the navigation?,"I bought this player so I could simplify my music-listening while I drive up and down I5 each weekend.IT WAS A MISTAKE.I've had it just over 24 hours and I've already had to reset it at least three times (yes, I updated the firmware).  The player died (wouldn't turn on) and froze (wouldn't turn off). Unfortunately the player has to rebuild the music library each time you reset it and that can take up to 5 minutes.  There've been at least 30 times that the music has stopped playing for no reason, and I have to press ""pause"" then ""play"" to get it to play again.  I drove for about 5 hours today and the battery is almost totally dead (I started out with a full charge).  The player turns itself off instead of sleeping, so every time you pause it and run an errand or take a phone call or whatever, if you don't make it back in time, you have to start it up again (and THAT TAKES FOREVER--FOR! EVER!).  Also it makes the most pathetic creaky cheap-toy plastic noises when you handle it (even without pushing any buttons), because the buttons are made of two pieces of plastic that touch each other.The organization and navigation of this thing suck.  I have a car stereo that plays MP3 CDs, and the navigation is painfully simple:  Press the joystick up or down to flip through folders, and press right or left to choose a song. EASY!  I assumed (like a dodo) that an MP3 player as well-received as the Zen V Plus would work on a similar principle.  I was WRONG.  The Zen V Plus sorts by tags, and you can choose to select by artist, album, or genre, or select all tracks. I put a 6-CD compilation on the Zen V Plus, so there are around 100 different artists from that comp alone; with all of the other albums on the player, there are a couple hundred artists in the artist list.  So, yes, I sometimes have to scroll through a hundred or more artists to find the one I want. Did I mention I got this player to use while I'm DRIVING? Can't scroll and drive.  I guess I could simplify the process by hooking up the Zen to my computer, firing up the MP3 management software and creating a playlist, but the software is a joke.  Regardless, once you have a playlist, you still have to navigate through the menus to pick the playlist, then scroll through everything in that list; you can't even re-sort the list (e.g., by artist or album title) as far as I can tell.  If you make a playlist of all of the songs, you might have to flip through 300 of them to get where you want to be. You also have to update that list each time you add/remove albums from the player.  An alternative would be to make a zillion playlists and scroll through those. I don't want to! I shouldn't have to.  So, long story short, ha ha, to get access to all of your albums, you have to either select every album and scroll through songs individually, by the hundreds, or you have to stop after each album and go into the menu and navigate to the next album or playlist, which you can't do while you're driving.  The player doesn't go from the end of album A to the beginning of album B. It stops at the end of A (you can put it on repeat if you want). And just to make this clear as daylight:  In a playlist, you cannot skip over an entire album with just the push of a button.  You have to skip each song until you get to the next album on the list (20 songs on the album you don't like? Then you'll have to push 20 times to get past it). I just want to be able to listen to my albums continuously, in alphabetical order by band - album title, and skip over an entire album if I don't feel like hearing it. That isn't asking much.The alarm feature on this is nonsense.  The ""alarm"" is a black dialog box on the screen. Great alarm, right?The headphones that came with this player are insulting.  They feel awful and they sound rotten (distortion at volume level 8 [of 25]). I'm to the point that I'm wondering if someone dropped the whole thing in a lake on its way to me.  How could anyone think it's okay to sell something like this?So...any good points?  I guess one good thing about this player is that you don't have to look at the controls to operate them (as long as you don't have to look at the screen, I mean). It's easy to tell which control is which by touch. I can't think of any other good points offhand.  I would say ""The Creative Zen V Plus has never personally tried to kill me"" but I'm not totally sure that's true.If anything in this review is inaccurate, please advise! If I can't return this piece, I'd like to know how to make it less useless and aggravating. I'd consult the user manual but it's essentially useless as well.  Thanks for reading!  Please excuse the negative tone here; I am just really disappointed.  If you get one of these, I hope you have better luck than I've had.

I had been in line toget it the very first day it was offered and while it is an adequate device for meia consumption it has its flaws. Things that I was willing to live with on a smaller screen just bothered me too much on iPad. The really small amoutn of RAM was also something that immediately caused issues (it has 256 Mb of RAM half of what is available on iphone 4). I had been waiting for Another tablet device to fix teh issues with iPad and Asus seemed to have delivered. A battery life that was comparable to iPad. An OS that was designed from the ground up for tablet (honeycomb) and an accessory (dock) that seemed to fix everything the device was lacking (keyboard, extra battery, extra expansion ports). On the surface Asus Transformer is an excellent replacement for iPad.It is, however, not a perfect device yet. I 'll admit majority of the issues are software related and should be fixed with the next release (Icecream sandwich). The Tegra processor is fast and 1GB of memory is enough to open a lot of pdfs without any issue. The screen is gorgeous and the soft touch back makes it easy to hold. 10.1"" 16:9 ratio screen however is a bit unwieldy but since this is the resolution every Android tablet (to date) has; it is not something you can fix by getting another device. To me 4:3 screen of iPad makes it easy to hold in any orientation and Android tablets' 16:9 screen make it more suited for landscape use.I am still not a fan of multitasking the way either iOS or Android do however, Honeycomb does it better than iOS.

Again, stay away from this device, and pretty much any device by Cisco/Linksys which uses a Marvell chip.  If possible, only use a Broadcom or other chip which allows for better options in horrible firmware.Original:I'll start by giving my credentials, and after that you can take it as you wish.  I'm Cisco certified and work on networks for a living.  I've owned dozens of routers in the past, and I'm a major fan of Cisco, as I was Linksys.Here's the problem:  Cisco/Linksys created this new line of routers with a chipset that was meant for blocking techies from modifying the firmware/software on it.  As simple as it may seem, the hardware/chips are flawed, and have major issues.With that said, here's what's happened so far:1. In 2 different locations of residence, I've experienced the same issues.2. I've worked with Linksys/Cisco to try to resolve the issue, and I'm on my second one with the issue starting to occur again.3. I've changed channels, equipment and so forth, but Wireless on this device is very, very bad.What are the issues?1. Poor reception on some units.2. Constant disconnecting on most Laptops.3. Major issues when using an Xbox.  If you have an xbox, avoid this router like the plague.  Even when port forwarding and MTU is configured, you will kill connections to ALL other devices on the network.4. ""Auto"" channel is absolutely useless.5. No external antennas.6. Overheats like it's its job, even when in the open.7. Too much ""over simplifying"" for end-users has turned it into a piece of garbage.  Being easy is one thing, but adding a massive amount of trash to an install to make it better, ends up creating more problems in the end.8. No options for Tomato or DD-WRT, as it's locked down.9. Service stinks.  You'll be hours trying to get an RMA if that's even your problem; mine ended up just being that the hardware is horrible.In summary, don't buy this thing.  I had a netgear dual band router that was 10 times the reliability that this is, and it's hard for me to say that, considering I literally work on Cisco equipment all day.  I only switched because lightning burnt up my Netgear and this one was cheaper.  Never again will I make the same mistake.  I promise you, you'll eventually be disappointed in this.

B005HMKKH4,electronics,Is a great portability?,"This external hard drive does what it is supposed to: write, store, and read back large quantities of data at high speed. It must also do so reliably for a period of years, but at this early stage I cannot vouch for that. Ease of installation is also essential; a mass storage device should be completely plug-and-play; and it is helpful for it to be preformatted--this one is formatted NTFS for Windows XP and above. These are all the qualities that I want in such a device, but this drive also provides a couple of bonuses: portability and backup software. Although I use the drive with a desktop, portability, i.e. small size and ability to be powered from a USB port, are nice to have anywhere; not having to have an extra cable with a transformer plug that takes up a lot of space on a power strip is a convenience to cheer.As to reliability over a period of years, I have only had my new drive for a week, so I cannot speak to that; however, I will try to make it a point to update this review should the drive fail prematurely (I expect about a five-year lifespan--knock on wood). Thus far, I have written 340 GB of data to it; and from it I have played back HD video (full-frame-rate, full-HD mpeg-type, not just Flash) without a hitch or a glitchAmong these reviews I noticed a lot of complaints about the backup software. They may very well true; and this is not to excuse WD; but I have to say that I have never met a backup program that I liked. Most, including some top-rated, have vital functions that simply don't work. I currently use Windows 7's own backup program; it isn't great--not much flexibility and control; but it's free, and it works (so far).My main motivation for writing this review is to try to provide a little help with installation, which should reassure prospective buyers disturbed by the experiences reported by some other customers. I said above that installing mass storage should be a simple matter of plugging it in, and under the right conditions that is all that this drive requires. But ""under the right conditions"" can be a big ""if""; and a variety of issues can plague the installation of this drive as a USB 3.0 device. In my case, I had never attached a USB 3.0 device to my system before; and I found that Windows would not recognize the device when plugged into a USB 3.0 port. As a search on ""WD Passport USB 3.0 Installation Problems"" reveals, there are several problems that can occur; and dealing with all those is not the purpose of this review; however, I simply want to do two things: (1) reassure you that this device does in fact come with a good USB 3.0 cable, and that it transfers data at a considerably higher speed over USB 3 as compared with USB 2; and (2) to warn the buyer that (s)he may require a driver update for his/her PC. Regarding the first point, I am getting better than 2.5 times the data transfer rate with USB 3.0 versus USB 2. Regarding the second, the updated driver required will most likely be the one associated with the USB hardware on the motherboard of your PC; if you have problems using your WD passport on a USB 3 port, but not on a USB 2 port, visit either your PC vendor's website, or that of the maker of the motherboard, and do a search on USB 3 drivers. WD also provides firmware updates for its drives; but in my case at least, the Passport's firmware was already up to date as received.While I am in the business of giving tips related to the purchase of an external HD, be aware that if you want a hassle-free installation you might want to avoid drives with over 2TB of capacity. I, and others, have had issues, especially with Windows Backup, with 3TB drives. It turns out that the solution is fairly simple: use the WD Quick Formatter tool (available on WD's website) *before* attempting to use the drive (reformatting will wipe out any data you've already put there). As long as you're willing to take that extra step, it's fine to get a 3TB drive; and I have had no further problems with a 3TB drive. To be clear, the drive I am reviewing here is a 2TB drive; but I just thought I'd throw in this extra tip for people who are reading these reviews and are still undecided about what size to get.

B00752VKFA,electronics,What is the quality of the blacks of the screen?,"UPDATE - September 29, 2012So, it's been a few months since I wrote my initial review of the GT50 and I wanted to give another update.Overall, the set is working great. I have not gotten it professionally calibrated, I want to do that next month, but the picture still looks fantastic, both for 2D and 3D content (""The Avengers"" looks amazing!). Interestingly, I find myself using the THX-Cinema settings just as often, if not more often, than the custom settings I had generated using the various calibration discs. That may be more out of laziness than anything else, to be honest.A few things:1 - If you have a lamp or a window in your room that you think will reflect on the screen, be aware that the anti-glare coating will not cut it during the day. You'll need heavy drapes for the day and use a dimmer or just turn off the lamp at night.  It can be distracting.2 - My biggest frustration is that I am noticing some degree of line bleed, which I guess is a problem with plasmas in general -- I noticed it with my old Samsung but find myself noticing it a lot more with the GT50. I am very frustrated to have to report this to you all and I am going to see what I can do about it, if anything -- again, this is something that happens on all plasmas, apparently, I just wanted to make sure you all knew that I was finding it somewhat distracting.(Line bleeding is when a ""ghost"" version of another element on a screen actually appears on part of the screen where where it shouldn't  -- for example, a character's face might be in front of a window sill -- the ""ghost"" of the sill continues across the character's face.  There is some discussion of line bleed on the GT50 here:[...] )I am not going to change my star rating for my review based on what I am perceiving as a limitation of the technology (as opposed to the set) but it's something to keep in mind. I will be doing some research to see what, if anything, I can do to address the situation and let you know what happens.Finally, I have received a few email inquiring which kind of TV stand I have (in the pictures section). I got the stand in 2007 from IKEA -- sadly, I do not think they make it anymore. It's a pity, it's kind of a perfect TV stand.ORIGINAL REVIEWAfter six years, it was time to replace my aging 42"" Samsung plasma (during which a circuit board died, which ended up requiring an all new screen to be installed--thank goodness I had the extended warranty).  At first, I went with the UN55D8000, which was a good looking set, granted, but just didn't have the picture quality I wanted, so I ended up returning that less than a week after it arrived.  Then I heard about the new Panasonic models coming out, and realized that the GT50 looked like a promising candidate.I have had the TV for less than a week, and there is no way I am returning this incredible plasma television.  I will share some initial thoughts (and have submitted photos as well), and will update my comments later as a kind of progress report.If you care about picture quality and don't feel like waiting for the VT, look no further.  This set has one of the best pictures out of the box I have ever seen, with deep, silky blacks and vibrant (not never overly so) colors. My ""go-to"" test for black levels is the first scene of Episode 9 of the first season of ""Game of Thrones,"" which takes place entirely in the shadows. Quite frankly, I didn't know blu-ray could look so good. The details in the bricks and the clothing, all illuminated by a flickering torch, were astounding. There was a real sense of depth and clarity, even with this very dark scene--incredible.  I dialed in my own settings using the Spears and Munsil disc, but the settings included in the THX- Cinema mode worked really well and are a great starting point.The color controls for this TV are very extensive, and I think a professional calibrator could really make this set sing. I will get a real calibration done in a month and let you know how it goes. Suffice to say, once I dialed in the proper brightness and contrast and turned pretty much everything else off (and making sure to turn the ""panel brightness"" to low)--the set was great.I watched ""Tron"" in 3D using the Oppo BDP-93, and was very impressed with the 3D and the clarity of the picture. I don't have a lot of 3D content, so I will make sure to add more comments once I see more films. The glasses, which are not cheap, are light and quite comfortable, though it's annoying you are supposed to charge them via the TV--when the TV is on.  It would be nice if they came with little carrying cases or bags, but no such luck.I have DirecTV and the 1080i picture looks fantastic, as does the AppleTV's 1080p. It is with Blu-ray, however, that this set really feels most at home. I cannot overstate how rich the contrast is; my wife continues to comment on how much she notices the better picture, which is a great sign!I have this plugged into my sound system, so I haven't even heard the speakers, really, so I can't comment on the sound quality.As I illustrate in the pictures, the HDMI ports are very close to the side of the cabinet, so if you have thicker HDMI cables, you really need to coax them, gently, down the side so they don't poke out behind the set. I have a set of Bluejeans cables, which work just fine, but my Better Cables HDMI is definitely very close to the edge.  Speaking of cables, while the set does come with a cable stay, there is only 1 (though there are four places to put it)--Panasonic really needs to included another.The bezel is very thin and the set is not that much thicker than the Samsung LCD I had just a few weeks ago. I really like how it looks in the room.  The screen swivels about 10 either direction, which is nice. It's also much lighter than I thought it would be; I was able to put the stand on and lift it into place by myself (though, clearly, you should have someone help you--I was just excited).This is a really great set. I haven't seen the ST50, but I can't help but feel that the extra 24,000 shades of grey really push this TV to a higher level of picture quality. I am extremely, extremely pleased so far, and I am looking forward to putting it through its paces--and will let you know how it goes!Update (4/11/12):I started playing with the Internet Apps last night and wanted to add a few notes:1 - Every time I press ""Viera Tools"" or ""Internet"" I am kind of shocked how fast the interface comes up. This is, by far, the fastest interface I have ever used, thanks to the dual processor.  It's so fast that you start to get the feeling that you might actually USE the Internet on this thing!2 - Panasonic does have a web browser (App Store:LifeStyle) but it's a pain to download (you have to enter in your credit card information even though the application is free); I just wish it was included. I am going to fill out my credentials on the vieracast website because it's kind of annoying to enter in the data using the remote.3 - The YouTube interface is actually pretty nice. The text is displayed larger than on the AppleTV  and you can sort by HD Content only, which the AppleTV does NOT let you do--so that's very cool.4 - I still need to check out Netflix, Hulu +, Vudu and other applications. The GT50 offers a very comprehensive assortment of online services and, like I said, it's very easy and intuitive to get to.Other things:1 - Clicking on Viera Tools brings up a toolbar on the lower part of the screen from which you can access various items:- 3D options- THX options - basically, switch from THX Cinema to THX Bright Room and one other THX mode. Pretty good for testing out your custom settings with the THX ones.- Viera Connect - pretty much the same as pressing the ""Internet"" button on the remote- Media Player- DLNA - wasn't applicable to my system- Viera Link - not really sure what the difference is between Viera Connect and Viera Link; I will check it out and update this post- Eco - adjusts the auto-brightness features- eHelp - access to the 208 page manual via a specialized interface2 - There IS an iOS app (and I would assume an Android App) that can take the place of the supplied remote control. Useful, I guess, for Harmony users who may need specialized controls from time to time.  This seemed to work well for the most part but I have some thoughts:- The app makes ridiculous sounds when using the remote. You can turn the sounds off.  Really silly.- The trackpad controls are the default screen, but you cannot control the TV with them. You need to swipe to another pane to get to the arrow keys to navigate the menus. This was confusing at first and then just kind of irritating, because you have to go to one page to call up ""Options"" then swipe to another page to interact with the options.- The reason why I gave up entering my credentials to get the web browser was because the keyboard on the iOS app was NOT sending text to the TV. This is clearly a bug, but once it is fixed, this will work like the AppleTV, where you can use your iOS device to type into the TV, which is obviously much better than using the remote. Lame it's not working for me, though.- There is an iPad specific app which I have looked at but I haven't used with the TV (I don't know if it consolidate the various panes, will update).So, I dunno how important these services and Internet features are to you. I really like my AppleTV, so I already have most of them, but am curious to see Vudu's video quality and check out how Dolby Digital Plus sounds--I hope it works the Toslink output.  I personally will be using my iPad or Phone to deal with Facebook, twitter, etc -- even though image retention and burn-in are much less likely to be a problem on modern plasmas, I don't really feel like tempting fate with having a static web browser interface on the screen while I am surfing the web.hope this update helps!4/15/23 Quick updateTried the 3D. Here's what I got:1 - 2D-3D conversion was nothing to write home about. I didn't know if it was working half the time. Maybe I did something wrong, but it just gave me a headache.2 - Straight up 3D is awesome. Watched beginning of Hugo and found it hard to press ""Stop"". If you are into the 3D, you MAY want to get the 55"" for a more immersive experience, but the 50"" was fantastic, regardless. I still think the glasses make your eyes get tired, but still--the depth is really great, and the sense of immersion with ""floaty-bits"" was really top notch, at least in ""Hugo"".  Look, 3D might look brighter on the LED/LCD set I had before, but there was a sense of depth here that I felt lacking in the Samsung I tried out.3 - I have a few ""THX"" Blu-rays. I watched them in ""THX Cinema"" mode and they looked awesome. Maybe THX is not necessarily just hype?4 - Demo'ed the streaming services. Vudu's HDX format is no joke--it looks incredible, close (from my viewing distance) to Blu-ray, totally. HOWEVER, I could not get Dolby Digital Plus 7.1 (which is supposed to sound GREAT) output from the Toslink output on the TV. I am pretty sure DD+ requires HDMI, so that explains it. Still, DD+ includes the DD 5.1 mix and that sounded great. I was really impressed with the Vudo service and I think I will use it. Amazon and Netflix both looked great as well.  I still like the AppleTV UI, but this ain't half bad.Note: I talked to someone on the Panasonic ""Raise the Bar"" tour and she acknowledged that the iOS remote control app had some issues (the Android one is supposed to work fine) and that my problem (the keyboard not working) was going to be fixed soon. It was kind of cool that she knew about that.Finally, I put up some new photos showing a few off-axis viewing examples, a bird's eye view of the swivel angle, and some shots showing Vudu and Amazon content.thanks-m ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(11786, 11800)"

B009PK9S90,electronics,Do you think the audio is very strong?,"We have been using the Hero 2 for a couple of years and have loved it.  We use our Hero for taking video of skiing, rafting, body boarding, and getting underwater images.  So we were excited to give the Hero 3 a try.  The Hero 2 is a great camera, and the Hero 3 follows in that tradition, but the redesign has resulted in a few problem areas.  Below are the pros and cons after nearly four weeks of use:Pros-  It is perhaps 30% thinner than the Hero 2.  The slim form factor is immediately noticeable and welcome.  I always felt the 2 was too bulky.- Using the menu system is about the same.  That is, you use a pair of buttons to navigate through a series of two-level menus.  Your options show up on the small LCD screen on the front of the Hero.  The great thing about the Hero 3 Black Edition is that you can control the menus via a mobile iOS app over WiFi.  The app greatly enhances the the ease of use of the Hero 3.  If you don't  use the app (or the add-on LCD screen), be sure you practice navigating the menus and understanding the camera's features before you use it.  The menu and features are moderately intuitive but we need to refer to the user's manual for one-off features.- The WiFi on the Black version is great.  As mentioned before, the iOS app let's you change the camera's settings, but it also allows you to preview what the camera sees without having to buy the $70 LCD add-on.  Using the WiFi feature was very easy and makes this camera worth the price.  You can remotely start recording set the recording features (resolution, time lapse, etc.)  The Black edition also comes with a rechargeable wireless remote that replicates the small monochrome LCD screen on the Hero 3. You can navigate the two-level menu on your remote like you would on the Hero 3 itself.- The quality of the captured video is amazing.  You can select resolutions from VGA through 4k cinema quality.  We use ours at HD resolution and get great results.  The lens is wide angle, so you capture all of the action.- The camera is very versatile.  One of our favorite features is the looping feature that allows the camera to loop back over itself.- You can save your video in RAW camera format to do significant post-processing.  This is a great feature for pros.  It also has a ""Protune"" feature that records at 24 fpm (a TV standard).- You can take photos while it records video.  This feature works great, giving us clear wide-angle shots.- The LCD and extra battery pack that we used with our Hero 2 also work with the Hero 3CONS- The camera is fast and responsive, but a couple of times the camera has frozen while I'm paging through menus.  I have the latest firmware update, so maybe another one is needed by GoPro.  We have to shutdown the camera to unfreeze it.- The sound is decent, but not super-clear.  GoPro makes it clear that using the waterproof case will muffle the sound.  Well, that's the price you pay for a waterproof case.  With the standard case, the sound is better.  Without a case, the sound is very acceptable (but it still doesn't match the quality of the video).  We have not tried out the external mic, but it wold be a good idea to use it if great sound is important to you.- The battery life is only about two hours in our best case.  A second battery would a good idea.CONCLUSIONA great camera.  It is the first generation of an overhaul, so you might well-served waiting for the Hero 4, but the Hero 3 really is a good choice if you want to get your adventures on film.  We love using it for filming wildlife (using the MiFi iOS app), on rollercoasters, etc.  THe positives definitely outweigh the negatives.  Fun, versatile, professional camera.

B00A39PPCG,electronics,How is the sound?,"Sources: iPhone5 alone, iPhone5 with Decware Zen Head amp via LOD, iPhone5 with v-moda Verza DAC/amp, various computers using the Microstreamer DAC/amp.First impression of the V-MODA M100: Bass! The kind you don't have to quibble about. It's there in abundance for any conceivable need you might have. That aside, I see this M100 as 2 headphones in one (a bargain BTW) - the extra-bass model for gaming, TV action film, house and other bass-centric music, and the hi-fi model (using bass reduction) for symphonies, folk and acoustic, jazz, rock/pop/metal, and other such delicate genres. Unless otherwise noted, all comments below apply to the M100 using bass reduction, since I listen to music in quiet places mainly, and my tastes are mostly midrange-centric.The M100's sound is slightly dark, having 1-2 db less output in the presence area around 3-5 khz and more output in the upper bass than many other full-size headphones (ex: Beyer COP, B&O; H6, Senn MOE). Some of the other dark-sounding headphones I have don't compete with the M100, because they don't have the clarity and accuracy of musical tone that comes with the higher quality drivers and manufacturing standards that the M100 benefits from. Despite the impression of 'dark', the overall sound is quite lush, and very smooth from top to bottom. Although I stated above that all of the comments from here down apply to using bass reduction with the M100, I must repeat here that with bass reduction on, the bass is as strong as any good hi-fi headphone that has good bass. Some of the so-called 'neutral' headphones will have bass that's significantly weaker than the M100 even when the M100 bass is reduced, so I think the concept of hi-fi neutral is overdue for a revision.Some reviews I've read describe the M100's midrange as recessed, but of course that's with the default bass as I noted above. How you perceive the midrange depends a lot on where you play the M100. Outdoors, on public transport, in a noisy club - those environments tend to absorb most of the bass, so the M100 should be ideal in those cases when played flat (no EQ). Listening at home late at night when it's very quiet is where you'll hear the most detail, since the background noise level can be 30 or more db lower than outdoors in the daytime, and even a lot lower than the indoor daytime noise level. In summary, excellent sound for high fidelity music playback, if you follow my reasoning. Soundstage is mostly dependent on the music of course, but frequency balance plays a large role as well - since most reviewers are adamant about not using EQ, when they evaluate the M100 in their very quiet listening locations, the strong bass makes the midrange seem more distant, hence the soundstage follows from there.Isolation seems quite good, but most isolation is at the higher frequencies, so loud noises from air conditioners or dishwashers etc. may intrude if your music is soft and quiet. Leakage is low, but if you're in a very quiet office in a cubicle right next to other cubicles and you play your music loud, someone in the next cube may hear your music faintly, and some people are bothered by the least bit of leakage that way. It's very doubtful that leakage from the M100 would be noticeable to anyone on a noisy bus, train, or plane.My first M100 was pearl white, and this one is matte black. The sound seems about the same a year after the first one I had, and the fit is very similar also. But just in case I had the impression of a tight fit with my first M100, this current M100 is ultra-comfortable - so much so that I'm wearing it for hours at a time with no adjustments. The sound is so good (as described above) that I'm enjoying classical, jazz, electronic, rock, and other genres of music like never before - everything from Daft Punk, David Chesky, and David Lynch sounds just as spectacular as Michael Buble, Korn, and Miles Davis.The M100 in matte black (my color choice) is beautiful, and its military-gear stealth look is not only very classy, it doesn't tend to show dirt and grime. The military-grade look isn't just superficial though - the build quality is the best in the headphone business - all metal and perfectly finished, but not heavy on the head. At the time I purchased the M100, an extra set of metal earcup side plates was offered, with choice of color and even a custom logo. Those custom plates aren't expensive and they can be attached or detached at any time, so if the headphone is transferred to another person that person can use the standard side plates instead. Headband clamping force with the M100 is very moderate for a full-size headphone, and if the headband were ever to become uncomfortable on top of a user's head, I suggest pulling the earcups down an extra click so most of the weight is borne by the earcups.The earpads go completely around my ears, unlike some headphones that are described as circumaural (around the ear). The Sennheiser Momentum is one such headphone where the earpads sit partially on my average-size ears. The earpads are very soft and spongy, covered in 'pleather' I would guess, and are the most comfortable type of earpad I've used. The M100 has a single-sided detachable cable that can be plugged into either the left or right earcup. The fabric-covered cable is terminated with a 45-degree angled Apple miniplug, and the end that goes into the earcup is a standard (non-Apple) miniplug. In case of cable failure, any generic miniplug to miniplug cable could be used, as long as the sleeve ahead of the plug that goes into the earcup is no bigger than 7mm in diameter.The 4-foot cable has a one-button control with mic about 13 inches down from the earcup, and an additional mic about 4 inches down from the earcup. A second (7-foot) cable is included, having the same plugs as the 4-foot cable, but no controls or microphone. The 7-foot cable also has a short (3.5 inches) extension on the end in a 'Y' configuration, where you can plug a second headphone in. I didn't try it, but I wonder what the effect on the sound would be if you plugged two 18-ohm headphones into a music player using this cable. It seems like that would create a 9-ohm load for the music player, or even less if the minimum impedance of the headphones were less than 18 ohms. The M100 comes with a small zippered carrycase that's suitable for backpacks and airline carry-on bags.In previous reviews I've included the following music examples with comments about how the headphones sound with each track. My suggestion is instead of reading each one as an absolute unto itself, you could compare my notes here to those other reviews and see how the M100 compares with each individual track. Note that the comments below apply to the M100's sound played with Bass Reducer EQ as noted above.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has good detail and tone, and both male and female vocals sound natural, without favoring either. The M100 plays this perfectly.Ben Heit Quartet - Suite-Magnet and Iron (Jazz with a Bebop flavor): The piano that leads off sounds realistic, and the sax is soft. The M100 plays this music extremely well.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice is crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The M100 reproduces the space and detail convincingly, although if this is played very loudly the percussion may be too bright.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): Another track with plenty of space around the voice and instruments. The voice and high-frequency percussion (tambourine especially) sounds natural with no harshness. The M100 plays this music perfectly.Crystal Castles - Wrath of God (Electro-Pop): The moderate level of bass in this track has good detail, and the ambient electronic effects maintain their separation and never congeal into a glassy, hard, or ""ringy"" sound as some headphones do if they have uncorrected resonances. The M100 plays this track just right.DJ Shadow - Building Steam With a Grain of Salt (Electronic/DJ): This track opens with what sounds like very high and very low piano notes, and those high notes particularly might ring a few resonances in lesser headphones. The M100 handles those notes well, and reproduces the ambient voices with good tone and balance.Franz Ferdinand - Ulysses (Pop-Rock): The moderate level of bass in this track has good detail, and the percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced. The M100 makes this sound like what I imagine the original producers heard when they mixed it.Halie Loren - Sway (Jazz vocal): Bass instrument(s) here may sound boomy with some headphones, but the M100 handles this perfectly. The trumpet sounds natural but soft, and the voice has the right presence without sounding recessed or too forward. The M100 does a great job in both respects.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion hits hard here, and the M100 handles it well. The bass tones beginning around 0:45 into the track are the ultra-deep ""shuddery"" kind that require good deep bass response from a headphone, and the M100 delivers on those.Kaskade - 4am (Electro-House): The bass that kicks in around 1:01 into the track is subtle, but the M100 gets it right. The percussion and female voice balance well with neither overwriting the other. The M100 aces this.Katy B - Perfect Stranger (R&B-House-Garage;): The heavy bass that begins at 0:27 into this track is played very well by the M100. The voice is slightly forward, but it doesn't overpower the instruments or get lost in the mix. The M100 balances the different elements in this music extremely well.Machine Gun Kelly - All We Have (Rap/Hip-Hop): The heavy bass beats that begin at 0:23 into the track sound like drum impacts, although they're not sharp impacts. The male and female voices have a good balance and don't overpower the music or sound recessed. The M100 plays this as good as can be expected given the limited quality of the recording.Massive Attack - Angel (Trip-Hop): This track begins with a steady low-frequency sound and some solid deep-bass impacts. The voices blend well with the music and have just the right presence, although the recorded quality of the instruments isn't great. The M100 plays this very well given the limited quality of the recording.Morcheeba - Bullet Proof (Trip-Hop): Bright percussion and medium-strength bass impacts make up most of this, with some dance-club spoken intonations thrown in. The M100 renders the percussion treble correctly (bright, but not harsh), and the voices sound just right.Peter Tosh - Get Up Stand Up (Reggae): The bass here has a decent but moderate impact, and the lead and backup voices have good separation that's not too narrow or wide. The M100 renders the bass with good detail and the voices sound very natural.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are also some ""clip-clop"" effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The M100 reproduces all of these sounds faithfully.Rachmaninoff - Prelude in C-Sharp Minor Op3 No2 (Classical, Piano): Grand piano played mechanically from an original recording by the master himself. The bass is light here, but the piano tone is good quality. The M100 plays this track very well.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the M100 renders the tones and transients superbly.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are unusually strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The M100 delivers the impacts with proper weight, and makes the horns sound real.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string tones beginning at 0:18 are subtle, but clearly reproduced by the M100. The bass isn't very strong, but still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, sounds so perfect that this track could easily have been mixed using the M100 headphone.

B001E45XT4,electronics,How is the padding?,"I've owned a pair of Skullcandy Com TI Multimedia headphones for about 3 years now. They've always done well for me, despite not being a top of the line headset. I've used them for music, movies, video chatting, and in game communication. They broke last week.I was tempted to simply order a new pair, but These Plantronics caught my eye. I decided to give it a shot. Here are some impressions.The Fit:They're a bit wider than I'm used to with a slightly tighter hold on the head than I'm used to. Not uncomfortable, just...noticeable. I'm confident this will fade with use. The gap inside the ear cup is roomy, and the circumaural padding is soft and comfortable. It seems to be covered in a microfiber of sorts which is pleasing to the touch, but do trap some more heat than may be comfortable. (I recommend removing these every hour or so, just to let your ears breathe a bit.) They headset can expand to accommodate what I can only imagine to be heads of cartoonish proportions, so sizing should not be an issue at all. The mic slides out and can bend a bit for suitable placement.The Look:Aesthetically, they're damn cool. Matte black with a translucent red color scheme, the hideaway mic...it looks good, undeniably so. The square cups give it a vaguely futuristic look, which may be a plus for some. Frankly, it makes little difference to me, but there it is anyway.The Sound:The bass is a bit flat at first listen, but not to a point where it makes a listening experience any less enjoyable. It handles voice very well, on both counts. People sound fine on say, skype or world of warcraft, and your voice is equally audible to people on the receiving end.The Build:The headset seems well made, from top to bottom. The cushions seem fairly durable, the plastic does not bend or stress in any way, the mic boom seems well built and the cord is fairly resilient. The in-line volume control and mute switch also seem to be well made, although the volume control seems a bit...unbalanced. (The volume change from 1 to 2 is much greater than the volume change from 2-3 or 3-4. Volume setting 2 seems to be more than adequate, at any rate. My only gripe is that the plugs are not color coded for mic and audio. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2212, 2226)"

I don't know if it would be better if you hooked up more speakers or not because there really isn't much bass, but I wasn't expecting Bose sound quality here.  It does work great for boosting the sound on my device for movies, Netflix and videos, etc.  And I use it to boost the music from my iphone in the bathroom when getting ready.  I've even used it for music when we're out camping.  It's portability is really handy.  The only thing that would make this a five star mini-speaker is a longer cord.  That thing is short so it's not getting far from your device at all, but it's nice that it folds up along the bottom out of the way.  And the battery life is awesome.

B009A5204K,electronics,How is the sound quality of this product ?,"Love/hate with this product.For all the positives it has, I ended up returning it because of its' construction.Pros:- great connectivity, battery life and comfort.  The earbuds fit well and the sound is very clear.  It also holds a charge through a solid 5 hours a day.  I would charge it at the end of every day, so not sure how much longer it would last if I kept using it.Cons:- Although it is very comfortable and easy to wear during active runs and gym sessions, it just feels flimsy to me.The little earbuds are supposed to be held onto the neckband with little magnets.  These magnets are far too weak and barely hold them in when they are stationary.  They are also not the easiest to fit in place while the neckband is still around your neck.If you do manage to fit them in, the slightest head movement causes them to fall out.This is not only frustrating, but with them just dangling there, they easily got caught on my jacket, shoulder strap of my purse and scarf.It was an accident waiting to happen and I just knew they'd get torn off one day soon.Another concern was how they'd hold up being toted around in bag.  If you don't want to walk around with them hanging around your neck, there's really no easy way to transport them.  I'd wear them on the train to listen to music, but didn't want to leave them on once I got to work.  I'd put them in my bag, but then had to wrestle with a tangle when I retrieved them.Overall very disappointed because although user unfriendly, the sound and comfort of these were great.  If you're just going to be using them at home and not taking them with you, they will suffice.  A bit pricey for being limited like that though.  That's why I ultimately returned them.

B003ZX8B2S,electronics,How is the map?,"I have been a Garmin user for many years, and have owned many of the units, but I think I've purchased my last one.  My phone does a much better job.  Currently, my wife and I both have Nuvi 1450s, with lifetime maps and traffic.Garmin routing has always been ""quirky,"" and it has never improved.  I take an interstate into work, and the Garmin 1450 insists on routing me off and back on the interstate several times on the way (yes, I've checked and rechecked avoidances, routing methods, etc.).  Unfortunately, it behaves this way with disappointing frequency in other areas (my wife's unit behaves the same way). None of the turn-by-turn apps I've tested on my phone make this kind of error.  I can't imagine why everyone but Garmin can figure this out. I simply don't trust the Garmin in unfamiliar areas.I bought the 1450LMT so I could monitor traffic during my daily hour-long commute, but I've found that both of the traffic apps on my phone give me much better traffic info than does the Garmin.I had been using saved routes to work around the poor navigation on the 1450, but the latest firmware update has made the routes function much more bothersome to use.I still gave the 1450s 3 stars, because the display is good (easier to read than a smartphone!), although I should note that my wife's 1450 developed a circular dead spot about 3/8 inch in diameter after only a year.  The voice directions are clear and generally timely.  The maps are pretty good, and they do get updated.Bottom line, I'm done with Garmin until they figure out how to route efficiently and correctly.

The screen is brilliant and the speakers are amazing.  Normally, with most mobile devices, I struggle to hear music or movies with the volume up all the way.  With my phone or other tablet if I don't have an external speaker to pump sound through, it's not worth watching a movie.  With the Nexus 7, I have to turn the volume down slightly.  Oh joy!  Rapture!  A device with more than adequate sound!  I've never experienced such a mobile device before!Other than that, the device is beautiful and comfortable.  Top notch!But it's not all roses.  There are a few things to nitpick.  There's no micro HDMI port so even though the Nexus 7 is great to watch movies on if I'm not in front of TV, I'll still need my TF700T if I want to watch movies on a TV while on the road say at a hotel or at my parents house.  Then there's the lack of microSD card support.  There's not enough room on the device for all my music and because this is the wifi only version, I'm not always going to have access to my music on the cloud.These minor drawbacks prevent me from giving it 5 stars...but I knew these things going into the purchase.

B004T9RR6I,electronics,How much control does the camera give you?,"UPDATE (26 June 2012):I got ready to add a USB storage device (Seagate 2TB) to the router and when I launched the router page I was presented with a new screen and asked to create an account for Cisco Connect Cloud.  I created the account and was presented with a new way to manage my router.  The new way has a new (and improved) management screen that makes it easy to manage, it takes some time to get used to, but it is very user friendly (I am used to the more technical way, so I have to look closer through the options to find most stuff).  The system is nice since you can access it from different computers without using your home network.  You can now use neat apps to limit the network (like content and media and protect your network), most apps are advertised and some are available for Android, but most say coming soon for iPhone.  Some look promising and the new system is neat.  I look forward to the improved version for iPhone (over Cisco Connect Home). -- One thing to point out, the Cisco Cloud will log you out if you do not stay active (kind of bad for your own router...), but the device list customization is nice and you can add custom names and images for each item (to easily recognize suspicious devices.The iPhone app is also available in the Apple App Store and is a small install.  Once I logged in (with the account I created when I launched the router page), from the app you can see the status of your network (is it connected to internet, who [what devices] are connected), you can also edit most parts of the router settings (not the more advanced stuff, like the QoS, Gaming, and Internet settings), but you can edit passwords, wireless names and passwords, and guest access.  Pretty neat, and it will be fun to see what other apps become available that make this even better.I also wanted to add that when I tried to add my USB Storage device, I ran into trouble.  I had the drive formatted in exFAT (I did not want the 4GB file size limitation of FAT 32 nor a specific to Windows or Mac (since I use both)).  I plugged in the drive and the Cloud Connect did not recognize it.  I contacted support and they informed me that the router only supports: FAT32, NTFS and HFS+ formats.  So, I wanted to let you all know, just in case you try to use it with a LINUX formatted or exFAT formatted drive.  I am going to format it into NTFS and use the network only to connect to it from my Mac.  Once it was formatted for NTFS, the Cisco Connect Cloud recognized it instantly.  The settings were easy to understand and there were easy options to setup FTP settings for accessing files over the internet (I did not want this, since I just wanted to share the drive on the local network).  When I opened Finder on my Mac I could get to my drive over the router name in Shared section.  The USB storage section also included addresses to access your storage drive.I was excited to see this router after seeing the online push and emails that Cisco has sent out advertising there new Router with Apps.  I was curious on what they would utilize with the Apps.  Since my E4200v2 and E2000 both support the Cisco Connect Express app from my iPhone.  Apparently the big app, that is what all the buzz is about is the Cisco Connect Cloud.  I looked around for it, and it is not advertised on the box or on many sites, so I finally found it on the Cisco website, but it apparently will not be available until the Summer (I always believe that stuff should not be released until all the features are available, with apps and cloud based services this type of delay has become quite prominent). So I cannot use the main new feature until later...  Cisco says once it is available the Cisco Connect app/software will alert me.  As soon as it is available I will definitely try it out, but I have a fear with that high amount of Upstream traffic will slow my network down (I have AT&T; DSL), so I am curious about it, and will update my review when it is available.Now for the router itself:Like I said, I am updating from a Linksys E4200v2 to the Linksys EA4500.  So far there is no difference.  They have the exact specs (from what I see), just the new one has app enabled (for an app that is not out yet...)So Since they are near identical routers, installation was similar.  I never like using the install CDs, since I do not want there software on my computers.  So I plugged into the router using a network cable, and went to the router's home page (192.168.1.1).  The default setting is username: admin, password: admin.  I then from the main page set up my DSL connection, so since I have AT&T; DSL, I selected PPPoE, then inserted my att email and then my password (provided by your DSL provider), it is a different approach for Cable Internet (MAC Cloning is the easiest), although if you are not sure how to do this you might want to go with the software, I am familiar with setting up networks, so it is easier to do it manually.  Set your routers IP here, and the range of addresses for leasing (you can just use the default, unless you need more than 50 devices, then change it accordingly).I then went to the Wireless tab and set up Manual WiFi settings, I like broadcasting on the 2.4 and 5GHz so I can manually connect my 5GHz devices to this network and my 2.4GHz to there network (although 2.4GHz devices cannot see the 5GHz broadcast).  I gave each network a recognizable name for my network, and then used WPA-2 Personal for encryption, make sure to use at least two combinations (numbers + letters or + symbols), it makes brute force attacks nearly impossible due to time required (I use letters + numbers + symbols).\I then set up the Guest Access (which can be done from the web interface, this was not possible on the E2000s), I gave it a name and a password and limited it to 5 guests.  Guest access creates a network separate from your main network, different IP address group for the two (for example my home is 192.168.1.XXX, and my guest is 192.168.3.XXX), this way guest cannot see my machines on my main network.  A neat feature when relatives come over.I then went over to Quality of Service and set my Media Center, Roku 2, and Skype Applications as High Priority to ensure that they work properly even if I have a lot of activity on other devices.I also went into the DHCP Reservation (Home page toward bottom), and gave my Printer a Static IP address.  To do this go to DHCP and then if you see your printer in the list check the box next to it and hit Add, then give it a name and Static address.  You then need to tell the printer to use that Static IP (this ensures proper behavior).  If you do not see your item yet in the Client list, you can get your MAC address from the device (make sure to get Wireless if you plan to connect wirelessly or Wired if you plan to connect over Wire (they are different MAC addresses, even in the same machine! [Separate network devices]).  Then in the DHCP Client type in a name, your preferred IP address and then the MAC address.  I do this for printers to ensure that computers that connect to it using its IP address stay connected even if the network reboots and issues out new IP addresses (it takes a little extra time, but is worth it to ensure devices like Printers stay active on the network).This device can have USB HDD and USB Printer plugged in to serve as a file or print server.  This is great for people who have older USB printers and want to share it across the network without keeping a PC running all the time just to host it.  The file sharing is also nice for large USB HDD that you want access to over the network.In the end this is a great router, has some great features and is easy to install and monitor (whether you use the Cisco Connect or the Web Interface), I look forward to playing with the Cisco Connect Cloud (and wish that when devices come out that their new features were available at release), but in the end if you need a router able to handle larger networks, and high entense applications (I canceled Satellite for Internet Streaming and Off Air broadcasting (HD HomeRun to Media Center Computer with Hulu Desktop) and Roku 2, and canceled home phone for a Skype subscription.  Therefore, I need a router that can handle this type of network activity, and these routers (EA4500, E4200v2) have worked perfectly and never have any problem keeping my network live!

B005CLPP84,electronics,What is remote control?,"I purchased a regular roku hd early spring and absolutely loved it.  Got rid of my 85.00 mo. satellite bill and subscribed to netflix and playon for 15.00 a month, both of which have a ton of hidden channels so I get all the shows except one I always watched, and I can watch it online.  My hubby got an LG hdtv with apps and we were impressed.  After I read about roku, I purchased a LG hdtv without apps and hooked a roku to it and its superior to the one with apps now.  Netflix especially works better with roku.  After 3 mos. my hubby decided he wanted a roku since I was getting way more programming. Upon checking out roku I found the roku 2 available and we ordered the xs model with the Angry Birds on it.  It is a bit smaller than the original roku, has a place for a micro-mini sd card expanding the memory so you can add more roku channels then usual.  I really liked that!  The setup was great, it updated immediately and wirelessly with no problem 2 rooms away from my router.  I bought an ethernet cable in case the update wirelessly hit a snag, as it did on the LG, but didn't need it.  PLug in the electric cord, hook the hdmi cable to the tv and roku, turn it on and let it update and follow on screen instructions.  Simple!  I was surprised that  I could add all the same channels on his roku as on mine without having to activate the channels.  I knew netflix allowed 6 tvs in the same home on one account, but didnt know roku would let you add another roku without all the hassel of activations.  The only channel I had to activate separately was epix.  It is a 14 day free trial deal, so each account must be on a separate email account and each device activated separately.  I did activate netflix on the roku because the movie images are much larger then on his hdtv and his eyesight isnt the best.  It makes it a lot easier for him to select a movie.  This roku lets you use the ethernet cable or wireless.  It has the Angry Birds which loads after update.  My only complaint is that I cannot get round one of the Birds to work.  It loads and starts but I can't get any action.  Im not familiar with this game so will have to do some research on this.  The remote is better on the roku 2.  Its rounded instead of square, the arrow keys are more defined, it has a separate ok button.  It has 2 extra buttons, A and B to use when playing the game.  The instruction booklet is very poor concerning the birds.  No instruction on how to play the game or what those two buttons do.  The remote is similar to a wii, you wave it and the cursor moves to where you want it.  I may not have gotten a good install of the game so I will remove it and reinstall and see if that works.  This is a much improved device for 99.00.  Locally, the old rokus are being sold for the same prices, no discount.  May as well buy the new improved for 99.00 as an older model without the improvements for the same price.  This is an excellent gift, especially for anyone trying to save money in the bad times.

That is left to be seen.The design of the fan itself is great. It is flat, which is one of the design features that I was particularly looking for. The fan has a connected usb to connect to a power source but what is really cool is that there is a female usb connector on the backside of the fans male usb connection, allowing you to still utilize your usb port. The fan feels rugged and uses hard plastic for the lower components and a metal grill for the top surface. This is an important feature because there are tons of cheap fans on the market that can literally collapse under the weight of a laptop computer which is simply ridiculous.The fan is black so matches most setups aesthetically.It also uses one big single fan, rather than a series of smaller sized fans. The most ideal setup for this type of product is to have one mid size fan in the middle with a smaller size fan at each of the four corners. These fans are obviously more expensive but this is really the optimum design to cool your electronic devices.

I've owned 5 of the past Canon digital elph's (the most recent the SD790is), and I just returned the Canon SD940is.  I am blown away by the panasonic ZS3!  It does everything the Canon does, and more.  First, the response time of the camera is excellent:  shutter lag is minimal, autofocus is very quick, flash recharge times are quick as well.  I felt the Canon 940 was inferior to even the 790 in shutter lag and autofocus (I was missing shots waiting for the camera to fix on the subject).  The Panasonic has more pleasing photo quality, albeit slightly softer than the Canon.  Colors are more vibrant on the Panasonic, as is overall tone.  I feel like I don't have to mess with the image on the Panasonic like I did with the Canon.  Overall, a great point and shoot.Now for the true differentiating feature.....  This camera doubles as an excellent video camera.  I am blown away by the quality of the video captured in the AVCHD-lite format.  Even in low light situations, the video blows away any other point and shoot, and rivals the super compact $1000 Sony TG-5.  Where it surpasses the TG-5 is in the optical stabilization; the Panasonic shows far less handshake than the TG-5 (which is a huge issue for these ultra compact video cameras).  Finally, there is a point and shoot camera that can capture excellent video for those times where you don't want to drag along a larger video camera.  I own the Sony CX-12 AVCHD camcorder, and the Panasonic is not in the same league as that camcorder.  However, playing the files I shot with the Panasonic on western digital's WDTV via HDMI, video looks fantastic: sharp, vibrant colors with smooth panning.  I would not feel bad trading the portability of the Panasonic, and leaving the Sony camcorder at home (unless I was on a trip to Ireland or something of the like).  The video is truly remarkable for the size of the camera.Also worth noting; Panasonic was very smart to include HD motion JPEG as an option for video recording.  So if AVCHD-lite isn't your thing, you can capture HD video footage in the mp4 quicktime format.  I will say, however, the video is cleaner and smoother when shot in AVCHD-lite.Overall, for the cost of the camera, you cannot go wrong.  It is an excellent point and shoot with very responsive shooting times, and a great portable HD camcorder to boot.

I'm just going to say that the screen looks great, speakers are the best ever, and it's solid.But what I will include in my review is a few opinions.1) the bigger version is better.  Yeah it's the same hardware and software for the most part, but the extra screen space is really really worthwhile.  If you've got *any* spare cash, please consider 8.9 over the 7.2) accessories that should be included.  Amazon was great enough to include a USB cable, but that's it.  No covers, bumpers, screen protect or even a charger.  Yulp, not even a charger.  You do get the option to bundle things at a discount when you buy this, and it's to your best interest to do so.  Pick up the charger for $9.99, because when you change your mind later on, it's $19.99 separately.  Also, if you consider going mobile or throwing it in your purse, consider a screen protector or cover.  It will reduce the greatness of the screen slightly, but you really don't want scratches.  A spare cable is also really nice if you travel a lot.3) Ads.  It really urks me that you have to pay to have ads removed.  This is just amazon milking a little more money from the customer base.  You can find very similar tablets that match features and hardware for $199.99 that doesn't cram advertisements on your device.Overall I would not purchase this device for myself.  I feel that pricing it for $199 is kind of dishonest.  It cost to remove ads, it cost to add a charger, by the time you're said and done it's really closer to $225 before tax.  For relatively the same hardware and features and $199 price tag, I would recommend Nook HD or Nexus 7.  The only plus side is the tight integration to Amazon's electronic services.

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,How is the video quality for this gaming system?,"I've had the Chromecast for about a week now, and despite a few little hiccups have been incredibly impressed and pleased.  Considering the price, I feel like this is a no-brainer purchase if you enjoy streaming shows from Netflix, clips on Youtube, and/or movies out of Google's store.Setup was a little more complicated than I was expecting.  I have a dual-band router, both with the same hidden SSID.  The Chromecast has an option to enter in your hidden SSID so it seemed like there'd be zero issue.  Entered it correctly, verified, and it just couldn't find my network.  I went back and tried a few times, thinking I must have been fat-fingering a button.  No luck.  I un-hid my 5ghz SSID, tried connecting, no luck.  It only worked after exposing the SSID on both 2.4 and 5ghz bands before it would connect.  Somewhere on the device page it says it does work with 2.4ghz hidden SSIDs, and I may try re-naming that band and hiding the 5ghz again.  But I hear that's not actually too terrible a thing to break through if somebody's actually seeking to get in so I might not even worry about it.Anyway, once setup, it's worked great with my HTC One.  Finding content through Netflix, Google Play, and Youtube on your phone is so much more convenient and intuitive than searching on the apps on your TV, or 360, etc.  Basically - any box where you have to fumble with a remote to do searching and navigation, this is better than.  You kick off a movie/clip, cast it to your TV, and the phone is free to do whatever else you want while the content plays.  At any time you can get back into the casting app and pause/resume content.  Super slick.I tried out the casting extension on my chrome browser, and it works about like you'd expect.  You can cast a tab, and all content on that tab is sent to your TV.  Works reasonably well for me, and I can definitely see the use cases (photo sharing, watching things you can't get to through the other mediums you have).  I tried streaming a movie through my Amazon Prime account, and while it worked, the audio wasn't 100% synced up.  And of course if you want it full-screen, you have to give up your laptop while the movie plays.  Also - my laptop (retina MBP) got really hot, and really noisy.  My recommendation would be to not expect to use this feature on a regular basis for streaming content.One other downside I noticed is that while casting a netflix movie, the netflix screen takes up the entirety of my lock screen.  I received a phone call, and the phone was ringing but the caller information was missing, as were the 'Answer' and 'Ignore' buttons.  Had to ""back"" out of the netflix info (which is just weird on the lock screen to have to do) before they showed up.  Google Play Movies did not have this problem, yet still allowed you to pause/resume from the lock screen.Anyway - I really can't recommend this thing enough.  It isn't perfect, but it's also not expensive enough to expect perfection.  If you like Netflix, Youtube, and Google Play content to be on your TV, this is the easiest and cheapest way to get it there.  If you have other ways to get it there, this is still a worthy investment as it's infinitely more pleasing to use than a TV-remote based application.Very, very pleased.

B003ZYF3LO,electronics,What is the most important flaw?,"Before people start freaking out I am not comparing this to a Canon 1DX when I mention ""PRO"" in the review title, rather, that I use this consumer targeted camera for a very specific professional task.  I own 4 of these ""kits"", basically the D3100 and the 18-55 lens.  My company does high volume photography, mostly sports, schools and events (we will photograph over 90,000 kids this year) and I thought I would give these a shot to see how they would hold up for some of my basic sports portraits shoots and I am pleasantly surprised.  Make note of the word PORTRAITS after sports, we do not use these for action.I actually compared this, side by side, shot by shot with the Canon T2i when deciding which way to go since I was going to be purchasing so many of them.  It was actually a pretty big decision since I was deciding on a Nikon camera when my personal camera is a Canon 7D.  When comparing the 2 cameras I literally set them up on tripods right next to each other, took shots in the exact same settings, conditions, etc.  First, I compared everything in Manual mode, then I let the camera do the work in Shutter Priority, Aperture Priority and full Program Mode.  Without running through every single shot I can simply say the Nikon D3100 beat the Canon t2i, much to my surprise.  This was a VERY close comparison and, in the end, the price of the Nikon helped tip the scale in that direction.Image QualityThe D3100 wins here.  How, you say, is that possible?  The Canon is 18 megapixel and the Nikon is only 14.2...true, but Nikon has a secret weapon, the 18-55 lens!  Believe it or not, the 18-55 Nikon lens, the KIT lens that comes on this camera and many others, is actually one of the sharpest images Nikon makes.  I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't taken hundreds of shots, blown them up to 100% and compared them side by side.  Now, if you are looking for something where you plan to change lenses from time to time, then the Canon is the better choice.  However, in the case of my very specific needs, where I will never need to change out the lens on this camera because it is for sports portrait shoots only, you cannot beat the D3100.  I actually chose the Canon for another area of my business out of state where I needed more durability and flexibility...more on that in another review.As with any product, it will ultimately boil down to how you plan to use it.  If you are a consumer who is just getting into Digital SLR cameras, this is a great way to start.  It is cheap and it takes great images.  It has video, which is nice, although I do not use it so I can't give an in depth review of that functionality.  Make sure that you get the kit with the 18-55 lens though, that makes a big difference in image quality.It also has a great little feature that would be really helpful to beginners trying to understand how Aperture works.  It has a little animation on the LCD screen that shows an actual camera iris opening or closing as you adjust the aperture, which is helpful for beginners trying to understand the lower number being a bigger aperture concept.So, to sum it up:PROS:Price: You can't beat it, if you watch Amazon closely you will be able to catch it in the $500 range or maybe a bit less if you are luckyImage Quality:  Really amazing image quality WITH the 18-55 lens especially.Good for Beginners:  Has some really good tutorials to help beginners understand the basics of DSLR.Great ""Auto"" settings:  Produces really nice images on many of the standard settings for Shutter and Aperture Priority and full Program.  (although I recommend to beginners to try to learn how to shoot in Manual mode at least to understand how it works and NEVER use any of the silly settings like ""Sports"" or the other ones.)CONS:Not very tough:  It feels a lot cheaper than the CanonReally small:  It looks ridiculous with an SB900 flash on it!  (This is a con for me but might be a pro for others)Overall, I definitely recommend it for a beginner or someone with a very specific professional need like I have.  It earns 5 stars for how I use it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4073, 4087)"

B008RDI0TU,electronics,Does this have the ability to use batteries?,"UPDATE:  I've had this case on my ipad mini for several months now and I use it EVERY day.  It has held up perfectly, absolutely no issues with battery or keystrokes.  It had kept my ipad safe and very functional.  The multilayer protection allows you to really take advantage of travelling with your ipad.  The entire ipad is protected- this includes the screen, all ports, sides, front and back.Overall, I would highly recommend the Air Bender Mini. The quality of the keyboard and the protection it creates are great. Blue tooth works great! Immediate response and connects quickly once initially paired.-The keyboard is flawless, does not miss a key stroke and pairs immediately with the ipad.-Charges quickly and charge seems to last a long time.-The keyboard is nice and very responsive, all keys work well and it has very nice options and extra keys. The ipad becomes a lot easier to use since you don't have to switch back and forth from numbers, letters, symbols etc.-The keyboard is sturdy and it looks like it will last a long time.-When system is closed, it creates a lot of protection for the ipad.Possible improvements:Out of the box instructions are not too clear. I didn't know if the plastic hardcover was an additional screen saver or just a place holder while in the box. I tried to put it on top of the ipad but it didn't click into place. A suggestion would be to put a sticker with some instruction such as &#34;remove&#34; or &#34;screen protector&#34;There are no clear instructions on how to install the actual ipad into the top sleeve. I figured it out easily enough, but it took some playing around. Fortunately, I had the time and curiosity, but I can see somebody in a hurry becoming frustrated.There are many options for moving/adjusting/removing the screen, but no instructions/demonstration. You can move it horizontal, vertical, slanted, straight, tilted, it can slide in and out of the back for more options but it takes a lot of experimenting with. I was a little afraid I would end out breaking it before I actually got to use it. It's a shame that it's so versatile but not if you don't figure it out.Another example is the function on the back; the camera lens type thing is a little tricky to figure out. You can't really get a good grip on it and I always seem to drop it not knowing what exactly I did to release the mechanism. I have small fingers, and I can't seem to have enough room to grasp both sides to release it. Once you figure out the function, it great that the ipad can just come off the keyboard protected in a skin when you don't want to use the keyboard.When the ipad is attached, and if you are working on your lap -it always wants to fall back, seems to be top heavy and unless you are typing -you kind of need to hold it so it doesn't fall backwards. On the long view setting, even more top heavy while on a lap, almost impossible to work with the keyboard.Update: I tested the keyboard this morning on a table and it functions very well. The top heavy issue from the lap use is completely gone on the horizontal view and the long view. The keyboard is flawless, does not miss a key stroke and pairs immediately with the ipadI am one to always put a screen saver, then a cover of some form on all my ipods, ipads, etc. This contraption is nice in that it definitely protects the ipad from water, dust, bumps, drops etc. I feel comfortable that my ipad is safe but aesthetically it is not very appealing. Possible some colors or patterns would be nice.A nice addition to the package or to sell as an accessory would be maybe a dual head cable\splitter where one could charge the ipad and the keyboard at the same time if one wished rather than having 2 cables and needing 2 plug ins.***The instructions and the aesthetic value could use some work but overall the form and function work great. I would highly recommend this product for somebody who is looking for a keyboard. The quality and function far exceeds the aesthetic issues with the product.

B0088CJT4U,electronics,What is the light device?,"I have been using an old Linksys wireless router for nearly the past 10 years.  For the most part the router served me well enough to not want to replace it.  There were occasional instances in which the router would drop the connection during internet surfing or more importantly online game play, but I chalked it up as having to do with my ISP instead of my equipment.  Also sometimes this router would get in a funky state and i would be unable to connect to my DSL modem but that was resolved by unplugging it for about 30 seconds and turning it back on.  These issues were annoying but minor and infrequent occurrences.  I have tried other routers such as D-link and Netgear, but I did not like the interface enough to replace my trusty old Linksys.  I recently got the opportunity to get a new router from a company I never heard of before, TP-Link and I figured why not?Off the bat, I would like to say I do like the updated look of this router.  The glossy black finish and the large indicator lights on the front is a big upgrade in look from my 10 year old Linksys router.Looks aside, when I first got this router, honestly, I wasn't too confident that would would be as good as my Linksys, but I decided to give it a chance and if all else failed I could always go back to the Linksys.  However after using it for about a month I am very impressed with my new router and its features that are not present on my Linksys.  Since using this router I have not experienced any disconnections during online game play and while I won't say its ""faster"", my online games seem to play much smoother than before.I did really want to setup the TP-Link using the CD because of past experiences with using included CD's to set hardware up, but in hindsight the CD Setup was great and did not cause much issue at all.  After setting up the router using the CD and trying to connect to the internet for the first time, my ISP directed me to their page to setup a new username and password to use with the router.  I thought this for sure would cause an issue, but it didn't which was a relief.  To make things even better after the setup process was complete the router created a .txt document that listed all my settings, username/password and network keys for future use.Another thing I like about the TP-Link router is that the interface is just as if not more intuitive and user friendly as my Linksys was.  One of the things I disliked about the Netgear and D-link routers was that the interface was terrible making simple things hard to find and simple tasks harder to do than it should have been.  With the TP-Link router interface, every menu is easy to find and its functions are clearly explained.A couple of features I like about the TP-Link are the Dual band capability and the USB port on the back of the router which allows you to connect a USB device such as a printer or a External Hard drive for all computers on the network to share.  Neither of these features were present on my Linksys.I originally wasn't going to use the Dual Band setup but since it was so easy to set up and configure I figured it couldn't hurt to try it out.  I have my laptop, cell phone, and my son's 3DS connected to the 2.4GHZ network, while I have my XBOX and PS3 connected to the 5GHz network.  Since using this new configuration I haven't had any disconnections on my XBOX or PS3 while playing them online.  As I said before when disconnections occurred in the past I thought it was my ISP, but now I haven't had any disconnections since, maybe it WAS my old router that was the culprit.The feature I really like is the shared USB feature.  There is a USB port on the back of the router that you can connect a USB device to that can be shared across your network.  Since my printer was already shared over my network, I decided to use this port to connect my external hard drive so I could perform my system backups more easily.  Prior to this setup, I was using Buffalo Link stations and Drive stations for my backups which didn't always work properly (especially with the LinkStation) so I ended up slacking off on backing up because it became too much trouble.  However now with the USB share feature backups are as easy as connecting the USB drive to the router and mapping a network drive on each computer to that device.  Backups for me are extremely easy and I can do them every night without any issue.  I have noticed that the transfer speed during my backups seems to be slower than they were with my Linkstation, however since my backups are usually done at night when no one is on the computer this doesn't bother me too much.In conclusion, since using this new router I don't even know its there which is a good thing.  The transition from using my Linksys router to the TP-Link was smooth and mostly painless. One star deduction for the slow transfer speeds, but other than that no big issues. I still have my Linksys in case things change, but I am hoping that the TP-Link gives me many years of service as my old router did. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5036, 5050)"

B00426C57O,electronics,How was your experience?,"I brought this for my mother because it will be simple for her to use. I especially liked the simple remote control which is not overwhelming. However the wireless connectivity was a little difficult and very finicky. The wireless router is located about 20 feet away, and we've never had any problem conencting with laptops or iPhones/iPods. However, I had to fidget with the placement of the Roku and attempted 2-3x before connecting finally. It then downloaded an update and after it rebooted, it lost the wireless connection again. So I fidgeted with the placement again until it connected. Then I tried to setup NetFlix and the wireless had dropped again, so I reconnected, got the activitation code and it validated the Roku box. Thankfully, you cannot turn the Roku off so hopefully once it's connected, it stays connected or tries to reconnect. I am hoping it was just the initial setup that was slightly flakey. To be on the safe side, I made sure the wireless router and the Roku had as few electronic obstacles around it. I am very impressed with the streaming technology and how the Roku is able to buffer the streaming so the movie is shown smoothly and crisply. It does look so much better than watching NetFlix on the PC or Wii. I also have Netflix on the PS3 and Xbox360 and I find the quality comparable. Another great feature is that the audio is turned on for BOTH HDMI and left/right audio cables so you can run the sound to the receiver and TV. Unfortunately, I ran out of optical inputs on the receiver but I'm assuming that toslink connection is always on as well. I have high hopes that my mother will be able to use the Roku, and once Netflix starts providing closed-captioning on the Roku, it will be even more useful! I am just concerned about the wireless connectivity but if it does prove to be a problem, my solution would be to run ethernet straight to the Roku or wire the electrical outlets with Netgear PowerLine equipment (they seem to provide very good results).

B005CLPP84,electronics,Why the performance of this lens is very poor?,"I really wanted to like this device. Great concept and can save you hundreds on Cable TV bills, but most recent changes basically broke the product, which used to be a more reliable device and better value for your money.--The positive--If you are into movies, already have a Netflix or you're an Amazon Prime subscriber and you don't have any game console at home, this is a great little device. For about 100 dollars and without any extra monthly payments, you will be able to enjoy tons of movies for free, even some important TV shows.The interface is relatively easy to use, but configuring channels require a PC. This is kind of annoying when you have to do that with several channels, wish you can do that directly with the console only, but once you passed that stage let's say there are no more extra steps or additional settings that you need to tweak.On the aesthetic side, is really small. The company also states it uses less power than previous model, but I honestly do not think that you will save thousands of dollars anyway; the biggest savings come from dropping your Cable TV service altogether.--The not so nice and what changed --Here's are the bad news. The firmware and software is buggy. I was watching Amazon on demand and the stuff restart twice. It happened several times and continue to happen, even after firmware upgrade. Something similar with Netflix. The ""supported"" channels take an eternity to load, like CNN. I understand that this device is basically a ""man in the middle"", just streaming the online content to your TV, but the previous model was much more stable (I sold it to get this one)But, If you are more into TV shows or live news, you are out of luck with Roku 2. Most of the unofficial channels do not work anymore: PlayOn, Plex, NokNok. Those basically allow  you to watch local USA TV or CBS on your TV, via Roku. They were working on the previous model, for some weird reason (copyright issues or software problems) they no longer work on this one and no ETA of when is going to be fixed, maybe never, who knows.So in a nutshell. You will loose the capability of watch those unofficial channels I mentioned, some ports were removed, the box is smaller and uses less power, and gives you a higher resolution for some movies or show. Worth the money? I don't think so. You can do exactly the same (with the exception of games and getting a higher resolution) with the Roku 1. Hence, I don't see a reason to upgrade or buy the new one.This is a nice product but it is too buggy or the company started to loss its battle against major TV stations.By the way, I currently have a 12Mbps Internet connection. Not a T1 or Fiber Optic, but more than enough to handle HD video streamingBuy the previous model instead and enjoy while it last ... it is a shame that USA users are condemned to pay higher bills if we want live TV and good programming...** EDIT ***8/16/2011Bought the previous model again, which I sold by mistake. Run the setup, added PlayOn, it works!!! Time to sell Roku 2.People, this is one of those cases where new does not mean better or faster. Just one more comment, we can still have or get 1024 dpi resolution on previous model. Also, most channels are not providing anything higher than 740, so even in resolution you're not going to lose anything if you buy the previous model instead.I would probably take a look on Roku 2 on 6 months or so, when it gets a more stable firmware and patches.For those interested: my PlayOn runs on a Mac mini 2010. The Mac Mini has 8GB of RAM and I assigned 2GB to the virtual machine. The virtual machine runs Windows XP SP3 and the virtualization software is Parallels.

Yes it is, in a sence, a way for amazon to get you to buy from them all kinds of media, but im happy with that. I love amazon. Everybody in the family knew she was receiving this for christmas so it made it easy for them to buy a gift card to excatly the place she would want one to. On a parent note...i chose this tablet for 2 deciding factors. One: its user friendly. I didnt have to spend an hour trying to figure out how to operate it. It came registered to my amazon account, and when i wanted to put my daughters name on the kindle instead of the name it came registered to ( mine) it was a snap. And those types of things usually take me forever to figure out. Everything on this device is very simple to use. I was worried how to swap things in and out of the cloud before i received it, but that also is so easy. You dont even have to think about it. Its plainly there and explains itself. So for anybody that wants a tablet but struggles with electronics and how to make them work right, this is for you. I wish all devices were this easy. The second deciding factor for me was the parental controls. And im not even using the free time feature. That adds even greater saftey and control even over how long your kids are allowed on it. But just from the standard functions i was able to set a passcode for turning wifi on, im able to block anything i want without locking everything as a whole. I can block just movies, or just the web, so thats why i went with the kindle,its the tablet she asked for, but it was a great choice. The ease of use and the great parental controls the other tablets didnt offer. The picture qualty is amazing, as well as the sound. They are not lying when they say these features are great. So this is just my 2 cents on my thoughts on this device for our 8 year old.  My daughter has also done more reading on this tablet in a week then she ever has, so its been very good for her on that end as well. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2481, 2495)"

B001HK4LWA,electronics,How is the function?,"First thing I noticed about my T1i was it cramped my hands, my pinky fingers had no where to go and there was not enough camera to ""hang"" my hands onto.  The Opteka grip gives many more finger and hand placement options to counterweight those hefty lenses you put on the front...you do have hefty lenses right?  I was killing the canon battery rapidly, the dual capacity and the included batteries is great for me, the AA cartridge a nice save if a bad chain of events happens to ya.  You can get AA's anywhere !  I think someone should MAKE a battery grip that makes the camera wider as a full frame/body cam is...Canon wont cause thats what sells the big ones...I'd give much more for my T1i to feel like a 50D. This grip is so far a great bang for the buck !The shutter button is even usefull in landscape mode if you are adjusting tripod controls and sneaking your hand to shutter button without scaring birds...stealthier to go to bottom of cam than top for shutter release...although a remote would be great !

B0088CJT4U,electronics,How is the configuration?,"I had my internet up and running with this router in minutes. It was not simply plug and play, but I believe that is par for the course with cable internet service. I plugged all the cables in, and there was no internet connection. I simply then went through the guided setup available through the router's administration portal and I was all set. We noticed a big difference with our wireless network speed and reach after hooking this router up. Previously, we had trouble streaming high quality videos on our iPads from the other side of the house. After setting this router up, we have no problems. This could be due our old router being just old and slow. But I also used the dual-band feature, and have our iPads connected to the 5 ghz network. I think that we noticed the improvement because we are getting less interference from cell phones and baby monitors. We also have the 2.4 GHZ network running for devices that are not 5 GHZ capable (my cell phone, for example). Altogether, I'm very pleased with this router and would recommend to others.

B00829TIEK,electronics,What is the quality of room?,"I got this drive because it was thunderbolt and connected to by Apple thunderbolt display.  It connects to the back and the drive is available anytime I plug my Macbook Pro into the display.  this feature makes it very convenient to have time machine turned on.  The only downside I have found is that you need to remember to eject the drive every time you disconnect your macbook or you get the nasty message about not unmounting a disconnected drive.The setup for this drive was very easy, just plug it in and respond to the prompt on if you want the drive used for timemachine.  At that point the rest of the process was automatic.  On a Mac I am not sure what the purpose of the Seagate software is, it looks like it provides a good application for windows machines and on the Mac it provides a mechanism for uploading your pictures and movies.  I didn't find much use for this, so de-installed it after playing with it for a while.I noticed a significant speed difference between this drive and other USB 2.0 drive backup solutions I have used.  It makes keeping a timemachine backup of your machine a very easy thing to do and no issues with waiting for it to complete.I would definitely buy this solution again, perfect for the job.

B005KOZNBW,electronics,How was the response?,"Purchased this because my old Western Digital WDTV Gen2 was having serious issues playing newer MKV files. Preferred this over the WDTV Live Hub because it has a faster processor and more memory (512MB vs 256MB in the Live Hub), so is overall more powerful than the WDTV Live Hub. Also liked the included Wireless N capability.After unboxing it and using it for a day I have pros and cons immediately.Pros1. Far better remote than previous models. I like the better size and more ergonomic shape, the bottom has a rubber sort of material.2. The new Mochi UI is actually a pleasing sight and works well compared to older versions.3. Everything seems to play, but still occasional bug (see Cons). Newer MKV files will work.4. Doesn't get very warm even when playing high bitrate 1080p video.Cons1. Wireless N is flaky and lacks range. If you are 3-5 feet from the router it's fine. Anything beyond that, 20+ feet, good luck. Upon using WPS to connect to wireless router it initially worked but doesn't seem to want to connect anymore afterwards. So do not purchase this based upon it's wireless. I'm looking at using a wireless access point as a better alternative.2. Although it will play media like MKV files it still has issues with them on occasion. I've had a few that just crash back to the file browser and some that just lock up the device altogether, requiring a power cycle of the WDTV player just to get it working again.

B00DVFLJDS,electronics,How would you rate the battery life for the radio?,I was a previous owner of the 2012 Nexus 7 which I loved at first but quickly became frustrated with due to performance issues.If you are thinking about upgrading the new 2013 Nexus 7 is almost better in every way.Things I like:- much better performance even in chrome (although maybe not perfect)- MUCH better screen. I honestly don't care whether it is high res or not but the old Nexus 7 had almost yellowish whites and uneven backlighting. This screen is 100% better.- another note about the screen. I was very worried that it wouldn't get dim enough for reading in the dark but it isn't any more troublesome than my old nexus 7 and it gets VERY bright for outside reading.- sound from the speakers seems better- I'm very happy to not have any of the main bugs (GPS and touch issues) that others are complaining about.Things that could be better:- the battery life while actually using the tablet isn't as good as the old Nexus 7. It isn't bad but I could use the battery up in a single day with a long web browsing session if I wanted to.- it is a little harder to hold - a combination of the back being less grippy and the side bezels (in portrait) being much smaller.- the screen can be overly sensitive at times. I don't think this is the same as the ghost touch bug because I've checked that the screen works properly with an app and I have no issues using swype. But I often accidentally click links or zoom in when web browsing- chrome still kind of sucks but that is chrome's problem.Overall I'm happy with my upgrade and I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone.

B00009R6TA,electronics,How is the padding?,"I like this backpack because it is not too big or too heavy. The straps are well padded and there are extra straps to go around your chest and waist to make it easier to carry. The main compartment is large. I keep my Canon 5D Mark II with a 17-40mm lens attached and a 70-200mm f/2.8L with hood reversed on the side. That leaves room for another telephoto lens (or 2 zooms or primes) on the other side and a smaller prime under the camera. As you can see you, you can fit A LOT in here. The inside is well padded.

I don't know if it would be better if you hooked up more speakers or not because there really isn't much bass, but I wasn't expecting Bose sound quality here.  It does work great for boosting the sound on my device for movies, Netflix and videos, etc.  And I use it to boost the music from my iphone in the bathroom when getting ready.  I've even used it for music when we're out camping.  It's portability is really handy.  The only thing that would make this a five star mini-speaker is a longer cord.  That thing is short so it's not getting far from your device at all, but it's nice that it folds up along the bottom out of the way.  And the battery life is awesome.

B00F3SOHNU,electronics,How was my camera's resolution?,"[Edit 10/27/2013]After I began to edit the review, I thought it would be best to reopen the packed box and retest the tablet.  To my shock, it was amazingly fast compared to last Friday 10/25/2013.  Why?  I think that the two software updates that the tablet received needed a factory reset to actually take advantage of the updates.After the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I will retract my first review and expand it.  I want to thank those that participated in the discussion; their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.This review will be broken up to various sections.  They include: applicability of technical specs, applicability of software features, Samsung perks, UI, physical attributes, and the upgrading process.Applicability of Technical Specs:2560X1600 Screen:This screen is very bright, brilliant, and sharp.  It's actually one of the best screens I have ever seen on a tablet.  It actually blows the N8000s screen away.  Its very easy on the eyes while browsing the internet, reading a book or watching a movie.4 core 1.9 GHz Processing Power with 3gb of ram:The tablet can handle close to any application that is thrown at it.  After the updates and factory reset, S Note imported the entire 56 page pdf while the N8013 was still importing slide 17 of 56.  While playing graphically intense games, the tablet is smooth as butter.  When switching between apps and screens, the tablet does so rapidly with no lag.8220 mAh Battery:The original N8013 had around a 7000 mAh Battery and use to last all day.  However the increased processing speed and screen capabilities may draw excess power from the 2014 note's 8220 mAh battery.  So far, the Note 2014 has decent battery life.  The screen has been on for 7 hours and 43 minutes.  While the screen was on, I was taking notes with Lecture Notes for about 4-5 hours.  I spent about 30 minutes using Handy Scanner, an app that takes photos of documents and imports them into pdf files.  Also, I sent a lot of emails and uploaded a lot of files to to my Google Drive.  the brightness level of the screen was about 20% which is really bright in a lit room.  The battery is at 14%.  I got up at 6:00 am and started using it.  It is now 9:26pmRear 8 MP Camera:The camera is an upgrade over the 5MP camera on the N8013, however because the screen has a really good resolution, it seems to make the picture seem worse than it is.  I have this effect on my desktop computer with two monitors, bad pictures look better on the screen with the poorer resolution.  Anyhow, objectively, the camera is just like the ones from last year's cell phones.  The added flash is nice to have because a lot of tablets seem to leave this essential feature out.Capacity:Either you have the 16 GB or the 32 GB version; I'm pretty sure you know the benefits of both.  However its important to note that the 32 GB version leaves around 25 GB of actual space to use.  With the N8013, I never filled up the flash drive despite having close to 1000 songs, 200+ photos, and a years worth of lecture notes and document files.  However, usage patterns do vary; if you are the type of person that likes large games, then you could certainly get the 32 GB model of the device and then store extra content on a 64GB micro SD card.Applicability of Software Features:S Note:The main critical point of the 1st edition of this review revolved around S Note and the lag; S Note and the slow performance are the main reasons that I bought the tablet; the initial experiences ruined this tablet for me.  However, THE FACTORY RESET CLEARED UP ALL OF THE LAG/INSTABILITY IN S NOTE AND SYSTEM WIDE.S Note has a new interface that really contrasts with previous versions of S Note.  Shape and Formula Match have been separated from the main tool bar and included under the heading transform, the icon that resembles the cloud.On first thought, this seems innovative, however compared to the old version of Shape Match, this process can be counter productive.  For instance, on the old version, one could just select the shape match tool and then draw the shape.  If unhappy with the shape, the user could simply press the undo arrow and try again.  However, on the new version, you must write the text first and then transform it into a shape or text via the selection tool.  If you make a mistake, you must press undo and fix the thing that you were trying to transform.  This feature is annoying and counter productive in my opinion.  I frequently take Cornell notes where you draw a line down the middle of the paper, closer to the left side of the sheet.  With the new set up, I have two extra steps, I have to draw a line and then draw a free form or rectangular box around the imperfect line that I drew just to turn it into a straight line...As far as having Wolfram Alpha solve equations directly through S Note, some users have reported that its imbedded in the keyboard some where.Concerning old .snb files, the tablet does not support them on the fly, but it CAN convert them to the new format.  After the factory reset, the tablet is quicker and more stable at converting the .snb files; there have been no crashes during conversion.First glance, the previews to notebooks are gone on the new version of S Note.  The previews to the notes have been replaced with realistic looking book covers.  If you once depended on looking at the note in order to easily find it, think again; to get a preview, you must drag the icon down towards the bottom of the screen.There are more advanced templates available on the device; they actually look pretty nice.  Instead of calling home made templates ""templates,"" the device has a feature to import a photo to be used as a background for notes; this is better than nothing.As far as sync accounts within S Note, Google Drive seems to be missing as an option.  If there is a way to add it, please someone respond so that I can edit this.  In the mean time, I will look for a solution.  Currently on the 2014 model, Sync options include the Samsung Account and Evernote.Writing with the new S pen seems smoother and better, however that's due to the increased friction.  The increased friction seems to slow down writing a little, but an after market pen or more use may rectify this problem.[Edit: S Note Conversion/Import/Export File Sizes and Time to CompleteIF the relationship between file size and import/export/conversion time is linear, these results should be able to be generalized to your hypothetical 50,000KB files.My test file was a 16,314 KB pdf. To import the file, it took 197 seconds; this substantially quicker than the N8013. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the import would take around 10 minutes or 603.78 seconds IF the relationship is linear.This same 16,314KB pdf translated into a 59.74MB .spd S Note file once it was imported without any annotations. It took 40 seconds to export this file to a pdf document. For your hypothetical file of 50,000 KB, the pdf export should be around 122 seconds or 2 minutes.As far as converting .snb files to the new .spd format, the relationship seems to be 2 and a half minutes/80,000KB .snb file.]Multiview:Multiview is still here on the 2014 note.  Its useful but it doesn't use the same intuitive methods as the N8013 does.  Simply tapping on the icon for Multiview does not launch it along side another window, you must drag it over.I as well as other users initially reported that there is no pin window feature.  Upon further exploration, this is not true.  It is accessible from the Air View window; you must draw a space for the application and then select from the limited supply of apps including; calculator, alarm, You Tube, contacts, ChatOn, Hangouts, and internet.  In my opinion, this is counter productive in comparison to the old simple pin window button.Browser:The default browser has trouble with saving .ppt and .doc formats.  I went to blackboard and tried to download a .ppt for viewing and Polaris 5 wouldn't open it.  Using the Blackboard app rectified this occurrence.  I have not tested with Chrome yet.Polaris Office:Polaris Offcice is a great alternative to Microsoft Office for editing or creating documents on the fly.  I mainly use Polaris for converting powerpoints to pdf so that they can be imported to S note.  Polaris 5 can also be used for direct pdf and powerpoint annotations; this method does not seem to support palm rejection, but it's still very useful for those that follow slides, type notes on slides and do light annotations to the slides.Watch On:This is a great TV guide like application.  The bonus is that it uses the built in IR blaster.  This is a cool feature if you are missing the remote or want to impress friends.My Magazine:This is a great media hub for news.  If you follow world news, you can have a great deal of information in this one app.Sketchbook For Galaxy/ Photoshop Touch:Sketchbook For Galaxy is a great alternative to the missing Photoshop touch.  The sketchbook app provides an experience even closer to the real Photoshop desktop app.Samsung Perks:[Retrieved 10/27/2013 12:50 Central Time]""Get a $50 credit for music, movies and TV shows through Samsung Hub and a $25 credit for games and apps through the Google Play(tm) Store. New Hulu Plus users get a 3-month trial and new Boingo users get mobile Wi-Fi access for 12 months. Also, new Audible users get 3 free audiobooks and new Zinio members get a 2-month subscription to 3 digital magazines. New BusinessWeek+ Tablet App users can also enjoy a 1-year free subscription, and new NYTimes.com + Tablet App users get a 12-week free subscription. All that, plus up to 50GB of Dropbox space--yours for 2 years from the time you set up the app.""These perks speak for themselves :]User Interface:The tablet's user interface seems counterproductive in comparison to the more simple nature of the first edition.  There are some things that touchwiz does better and some things that it does worse.  All I can say is that the settings section is very confusing.  For example, Samsung even hid the developer options; they can only be unhidden by tapping the build # a number of times...Coming from the N8013's simplistic nature can be kind of harsh, but it is certainly doable.  Read the user guide or google the answers to your confusion.Physical Attributes:The tablet aesthetically is really nice on the eyes.  I always thought that the original N8013 was a little homely.  I'm not sure why the ""pleather"" (plastic leather) look has people complaining.  I think it looks nice.I do not like the capacitive buttons nor the home button on the bezel.  It becomes cumbersome to hold  the tablet in portrait mode; sometimes your hand may hit one of the capacitive buttons or it may be awkward to intentionally use them while the device is in portrait mode.  I have always found the softkeys that rotate with the screen better.  In addition, I don't like the feel of the home button, it seems like it may degrade over time; in my opinion, the less physical buttons, the better.  The iPhone, iPad, and iPod  home buttons of earlier generations seem more sturdy than button on the 2014 note; this may not be true, it's just a subjective thought.The S Pen tip certainly feels better on the screen compared to last year's model.  In addition, the S Pen seems even more comfortable to write with despite its skinny nature.  Another bonus is that it doesn't require a special rotation to get the S Pen into the stylus holder slot.Concerning weight and thinness, the tablet does look cooler than the previous edition, but if you are highly protective of the device and put it in a case, all of that really doesn't matter.The shift from Samsung's special usb cable is really nice.  Now, the tablet can interact with the USB cables that our smart phones have been using for years!Upgrade Experience:There are a lot of things that the tablet does that are similar to the N8000s, however there are a lot of things that are different.  There will be a learning curve and importing your old notes to the new note is not as straightforward as it could be.  However, the improved processing speed and screen are very compelling reasons to get this tablet.As of now, I officially recommend this tablet to new users or people that upgrade from a previous generation note.Again, I must reiterate  that after the factory reset, the tablet is much more stable and is quicker than the 2012/2013 model.  Moving forward, I want to thank those that participated in the discussion because their feedback and suggestions helped me to give this tablet another try.BEFORE BASHING THE TABLET AND INITIATING A RETURN PROCESS, TRY A FACTORY RESET AFTER THE UPDATES; I learned my lesson lol ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(12810, 12824)"

The only thing I find remotely useful is having an iPad or iPhone and watch youtube or amazon instant from it. All you need is to spend another $300 - $400 more to get this functionality. I am very disappointed with this for that reason. The apps/channels are limited. It seems to be yet another $100 accessory to an iPad/iPhone. On its own, I think the market has better products that offer more, like Roku and Chromecast, either better price or more features.I was looking forward to mirroring functionality of this as well, but again I was disappointed, the video pauses and then tries to catchup and the audio keeps cutting in and out. This happened with simple things like trying to play a slideshow from iPhoto. Watching videos or mirroring a game is out of the question. I am not really sure what use it is. Maybe PowerPoint without transitions or displaying something static.If you are an Apple-only fan and have the full apple suite, this product my be for you because I'm sure you can overlook all of these issues that I have had.I would suggest looking into Roku or Chromecast, or if you have PS3/4, Xbox360/One, or a Smart TV, you probably have the majority of what this offers.

B003MVZ60I,electronics,How is the audio?,"Ok, I finally got this puppy hooked up to my home theater. Getting Cat6 to the room in question was a bit of a pain so I had been putting it off.*I'd recommend Cat6 or better cabling and a router or switch with QoS features.*I'm limited on the features I'm acclimated to just yet so I'll update this review at a later date.Pros: Small footprint - inputs are great, including 2 USB 2.0 - the interface is easy to navigate and appealing to the eye - internet media selection is nice i.e. Netflix, Blockbuster, Pandora, Facebook, and so on - I got this gadget essentially to have a decent interface for Netflix that I could use with my universal remote. Honestly Wii has the best Netflix interface, but the one here is a close second, and since the Wii requires another remote, this is the winner. There is no ""search"" feature which the Wii interface has, but the built in categories are far superior and a bit comical to boot.Cons: It's a hundred bucks... The Netflix interface could have a search, but not a deal breaker. The unit is a little slow to boot.Thoughts: This is a nice little unit, pretty cheap all things considered, Windows like navigation.Update:I love this product! I've since purchased a few more. The interface issues I spoke of in my previous rating have been enhanced to include a search feature as well as more internet media options i.e. Hulu Pro etc. The one I would really like to see WD cut a deal with is Amazon. *Crosses fingers*You will likely have to do a couple of firmware updates, make sure you do them all, it really makes a difference.(They do take some time)I have had a couple of solid lock-ups, all you need to do is unplug the unit for a few seconds and plug it back in & you're off and running again. Don't take this wrong, it does not happen often and is definitely not a deal killer or anything; just nature of the beast. Just understand every now and then you need to re-boot it. Speaking of, an actual power button would be nice for this reason. (There is not one)So, highly recommend this product and Amazon had them on sale for $59.00 recently. *Presses Add-To-Cart*Happy Netflixing! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2128, 2142)"

B003ELYQGG,electronics,How much is the sound quality compared to more updated versions?,"This is a great value for casual listening.  I usually fall asleep listening to old spoken-word recordings which means I go through a lot of earbuds (tossing and turning pulls on the wires).  So to remain well-rested and financially solvent I need earbuds that are inexpensive and comfortable. I'm also a former (alas) musician and am demanding of sound quality.These Panasonic units fit the bill as decent, semi-disposable earbuds. They're very comfortable for my purpose. Since the earbud part is offset from the body of the driver, the driver doesn't press against the ear when sleeping on one's side. They've also held up to a couple months' use.The weakest point is sound quality. While not really objectionable, these buds are weak in bass and have a noticeable upper-midrange peak that the casual listener may perceive as ""clarity."" I'd rather the response was more even. But for 6 bucks who can complain?Bottom line, if you have reasonable expectations these earbuds are an excellent price-performance value. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1017, 1031)"
B004OOTRPC,electronics,Do you have a limited choice?,"The GoodI ordered the 55"" model from Amazon. It was delivered 4 days earlier than expected. As always, you can't go wrong by shopping at Amazon. When I first unpacked LG Infinia LW5600, I was so pleased at the aesthetics. I hadn't actually seen one in person and was amazed at how sleek looking the front was, and how incredibly thin this television is. It's amazingly about 1"" thick. It has a nice swivel base, which I love. At this point I wasn't going to mount it on the wall, but given it's incredibly thin profile, I would some day; it would look awesome on a wall. It was easy to mount on the base, and the television is light enough, a strong enough person could do it without help. I didn't have any problem. I turned it on went through the easy to follow initial setup. Easy Easy Easy to set up, and connect to a home network via WIFI.This set has more bells and whistles than you'll ever need, some being really cool. It has the standard stuff like Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, and even Facebook. It also has a web browser that allows you to brows the web just like you would on your computer. Pretty cool on a 55"" HD screen. The web browser even has some nice tools such as Favorites. There are Apps, just like you would find on a smart phone; some free and some for purchase. The ""magic wand"" remote is pretty cool, with it's Wii like function of just point at the TV, move the cursor over an item, and click. In other words, when you hear the term ""feature rich"" this TV certainly is.The passive 3D is pretty cool, although I don't have a 3D blue ray movie in my collection yet. The 2D to 3D conversion is surprisingly pretty cool and pretty well done. With the conversion feature, you won't get things popping out of the screen, but it does add depth to the picture, sort of like watching real life through a 55"" window. The glasses are very comfortable, to the point I forgot I had them on. You can walk around the house with them on and they do not hinder your vision. However, I did notice, with the passive 3D, you can't get to far off center from the picture because you'll get a lot of crosstalk. I did view some true 3D content in the apps section, which did have things popping right out of the screen. I was impressed with the 3D.The BadFirst let me say, I'm crushed this TV didn't live up to what is could be. I wanted to keep it so badly, mostly because if it's awesome features, and the sleek look. Then I started actually watching television. It was all uphill from there. Let's just point out the very poor sound quality form the speakers. I expected that. You can't expect theatre sound from a TV that's an inch thick, or any other flat screen TV for that matter. I also noticed, very distinctly, what some are calling the ""Soap Opera Effect"". It makes the picture, no matter what the source, BluRay, Cable, Netflix, etc... look like it was filmed on a home video camera. It's very odd and hard to explain, but it's like watching a low budget public access show that can't afford the really expensive professional video cameras and lighting they use to make Hollywood movies. Grab your video camera, go out in your back yard, and film your family, then watch it on your TV. That's what all programming looks like on the TV; even Avatar looked like it was filmed informally with a cheap camera, even though in HD. To be honest, at times, it was pretty interesting to see things in that perspective, but mostly it gets annoying because you never see anything as it was intended by the director. In other words, it's a huge drawback, but not the biggest.The biggest drawback is the different aspects of the horrible picture quality. First, let me explain, this ain't my first rodeo. I've owned plasma and LCD TVs, ranging from 40"" to 50"". So setting up a good picture is something I'm quite familiar with. I spent three days tweaking the settings in this TV, trying to get the colors, brightness, etc... where I like it. It seemed to get one thing right, I had to sacrifice another. Finally I just settled by saying it's not the best, but I could probably live with it, although it still ticked me off. Of the poor picture quality issues, this wasn't the worst. The worst and complete deal breaker was the incredible amount of motion blur and shuttering you get from this set. It's horribly intolerable, even to the point of causing horrible eye strain. This is in regular 2D mode, mind you. The ""True Motion"" feature is useless. In fact even LG Support suggests you turn it off. After the first couple of days of trying to get rid of the juddering effect, I called LG customer support and got a tech on the line. He said I'd have to switch the AV mode to GAME mode. This helped some, but only some. The motion blur and juddering were still intolerable, and what you gained by using GAME mode, you lost by adding a ghosting effect around any moving objects on the screen. The LG tech said, and I quote, ""if that didn't fix it, that's just how the picture is then."" Anyway, what's the point of having different ""Modes"" if you can only use GAME Mode? Didn't matter anyway, it still didn't solve the problem.In the end, the TV is sitting in my guest bedroom now, all packed up, and waiting for the shipping company to pick it back up to return it to Amazon. I went to Walmart yesterday and purchased a 60"" Panasonic 2D Plasma they have on sale for $898 This set was awesome right out of the box as soon as I turned it on. I spent less than 10 minutes tweaking the picture settings and I'm done. It's awesome every time now. I really wanted to love the LG set, but unfortunately there's no getting around the fact that you purchase a television to enjoy watching it, and this set did nothing but frustrate and annoy me. I wouldn't recommend it. You still can't beat a plasma TV for picture quality. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5819, 5833)"

The default auto-focus doesn't work to great in the dark, but the quick auto-focus is nice since it shows you green boxes where it's focused.  It's nice that you can zoom in using the LCD screen so that you can ensure your focus is good, but unfortunately, this doesn't work while in video mode.There's not fully-automatic auto-focus in video mode, but usually the cameras that do are too noisy.

B002C7481G,electronics,How is device?,"Hi,I am technical director at a software company. It has been a long time ago since I did my last programming, and nowadays I am doing mostly Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and Pdf document reading. Why all MS Office an Pdf ? Because 100% of our customers and suppliers use it.I like the iPad because I am truly a gadget fan, and I wanted to study its application to real business.My conclusion is that the software which is available for the iPad is still not mature, even tough the concept derives from the ipod/iphone, which have been around for a while now.From a hardware point of view, the device is quasi-perfect. Performance is great, size is OK (albeit I would prefer 16:9) and technological concepts behind the interface are very good. But again, almost everything is inherited from the ipod touch and the iphone. So from the hardware point of view, it is nothing revolutionary. An USB port would be a real plus.From the software point of view, there is much that needs to be worked out:The Numbers appliction, doesn't save files in Excel format, doesn't let fou open/save spredsheets from ""internet disks"" (WebDav Servers), with the exception of [...], which is really used for sharing documents and doesn't allow editing. So for working with Excel spreadsheets and sharing information for editing on the move with your co-workers, the Numbers application is useless.The Keynote app has exactly the same problem. No saving in Powerpoint format and no way of sharing the files for editing with your co-workers.The Pages app better, since it can save in Word format, but still no access to ""internet disks"".There are other offerings for MS Office compatible Suites, but I have evaluated 2 of them and both have big problems saving the spreadsheets, loosing the format and formulas when doing so. Result: Useless with the spreadsheets I use daily.The Mail Application is good enough, even tough you cannot send multi file attachments, so you will have to send the attachments one by one.The Browser will not render flash content. Until HTML5 becomes a widespread standard, this is also a minus, since flash is sometimes required for my business research.And as the last issue, there is not real printing support. Sure, there are some apps out there, but most of them uses ""tricks"" to print entire documents (like using a master pc for example: not really mobile).The iBooks application works very well if you are capable of converting pdf docs to the iPad format. Now I can read 500 pages technical specs on my couch instead od sitting endless hours sitting in front of my laptop (alltough I could use my laptop on the couch, believe me it is not really confortable).So my perception is that it will take some time until the available software matures enough, so that the device is ready for use in real business.As a home use gadget, it is a very interesting and promising device. But be aware: It is an ipod with a larger screen, which has it's advantages, since it can be used for tasks for which the ipod was not well suited to.As the time goes by, I will do more tests and post my findings ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3133, 3147)"
B00834SJNA,electronics,How is the quality of the datum?,"THE QUICK TAKE:  The Seagate Expansion 2TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STBV2000100 is a good option as a backup drive, or as an expansion drive that isn't used intensively.  It may also serve well as a working drive that's used more intensively but for temporary or replaceable files - such as a scratch drive or a media server.This drive is large enough and priced low enough that you can backup multiple computers for not a lot of money.However, if you're looking for an expansion drive - a second drive to augment a laptop or desktop - that you will use intensively, consider options with cooling and perhaps backup, especially if you will use the drive for your only copy of files.A DESKTOP DRIVE:  This is a desktop drive, not a truly portable drive.  You could use it to backup multiple computers around a home or office, but you're not going to enjoy carrying the drive and the power supply.A FAST CONNECTION:  USB 3.0 really is fun to use, if you have the right port on your computer to use it.  No more sitting around watching file transfers - the speeds are similar to those of a built in drive.KEEP A BACKUP: One of the keys to happiness in modern life is to keep at least two copies of every computer file you need.  If you have anything you would rather not have vanish tomorrow, get a hard drive - any hard drive - and make a copy. Right now.  Err on the side of caution.ALL HARD DRIVES FAIL - SO REPLACE THEM BEFORE THEY DO:  Hard drives are complex mechanical devices. They will absolutely, inevitably fail.  So manage them accordingly.I replace all my drives after about three to four years (if they survive that long).  It's much easier to replace a drive before it fails - it's very easy to copy a readable drive.  It's much harder to recreate a drive, especially a boot drive, after it fails - you need to reinstall all the software and settings, and maybe reconstruct the folder structure.And hard drives are cheap enough to make it not worth the risk to keep drives around longer than that.  I can usually get a bigger, faster drive for much less money than the original drive.Once you start to accept the reality that hard drives will fail, and manage your drives and data appropriately, you can drastically reduce the disruption that hard drive failures cause.BUY A GOOD MODEL OF DRIVE, THEN KEEP A CURRENT BACKUP:  As much as people like to claim that particular brands are better or worse, statistics don't really seem to back that up.  Buy a good model from one of the top brands - Seagate, Western Digital, Hitachi, Samsung - and then manage them as described above.That being said - some drives (or the firmware they are shipped with) have turned out to be real lemons.  Most of the big manufacturers make good drive models, and they have made bad drive models.  So much like your uncle, who never bought a new model car until they'd worked the bugs out of it - let someone else be at the bleeding edge of hard drives.  Buy models that have been tested by other users.It's a little soon to tell for the drive installed in this particular model, and some of the early feedback is mixed.COOLING QUESTIONS:  I can't really figure out why the cooling is so unconvincing on almost all external drives (like this one).  A tight-fitting plastic case, with no effective ventilation?  Really?  While drive temperature isn't perhaps quite as big an issue as some would make it out to be - that level of cooling just doesn't seem adequate for a drive that's running more than a fraction of the time.  If your needs fit that description - that is, if you need a back up drive, or an intermittently used expansion drive - then this Seagate external drive may be a good matchFOR AN INTENSIVELY USED EXPANSION DRIVE, CONSIDER OTHER OPTIONS:  If you need more space in an expansion drive, and plan to use the drive intensively, consider other options.  Perhaps a NAS (network attached storage) or a drive enclosure with more effective cooling, and possibly something with multiple drives and built in backup.WATCH HOW YOUR DRIVES ARE SHIPPED:  One of the key factors in whether a drive will last is how it's handled and shipped.  External drives such as this one are usually packaged somewhat well, although online vendors still don't seem to really get the concept of filling the shipping box so the product inside doesn't bounce around on its way to you.

B00007E7JU,electronics,Was prompt the delivery?,"This lens is what truly got me obsessed with photography.  Having a prime lens (one that does not zoom in or out) forces you as the photographer to be the zoom and to move your body to the best possible position for the shot.  This makes you think so much more about your positioning during your shot and forces you to actually move around which is a huge positive.  Also, having a lens that has an aperture as wide open as 1.8 forces you to actually learn about aperture and when it is a good idea to shoot with it wide open at 1.8 and when it is a better idea to use a smaller aperture.  At first you'll be very tempted to shoot with it wide open, but I have found I more often shoot with this lens at 2.8 because the depth of field is more usable otherwise it's too easy to let's say have one eye in focus while the other eye is out of focus.Like many others I use this on a canon T3i with a 1.6 crop sensor which means this lens will actually be 80mm.  This makes it a very ideal lens for portrait photography but it can be a little tight for let's say street photography.  If the focal length is a little long I would suggest going with an 35mm prime instead.  This lens doesn't have as nice of a build quality as some of the more expensive canon lenses but the price is unbeatable and the image quality is unbelievable at this price point.

Going in, I knew it wouldn't be a pure Android ecosystem nor would it have the latest in hardware. I looked at the Google Nexus 7 (Asus) and a Google Nexus 10 as well as the Asus Transformer tablets. The positive aspects of those tablets mainly focus on the Android operating system. Since I'm a fairly heavy consumer of Amazon products and services, the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) isn't a bad choice.It's easy to navigate, although the Carousel is rather annoying than useful. I prefer Android Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean as it allows far more flexibility and customization. That said, KFHD 7.2.3 is actually based on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, according to Antutu Benchmarks.The Silk Web Browser works much like any other Android browser, and the Kindle Fire integrates seamlessly with your Amazon Cloud services (books, music, movies, etc...) As a Prime member, I can also watch Prime movies in HD. For some unknown reason, Amazon does not allow Prime movies to be played in HD if using a PC - only devices such as the Roku, PS3, Xbox 360, and Kindle Fire allow playback in HD.The KFHD has a micro-USB and micro-HDMI port, with 3 buttons on the side for volume and power. I have a Belkin Chambray case that I first used, but it made the KFHD look and feel cheap. There are lots of cases on the market that use straps to hold the KFHD in place, and then another elastic strap to keep the cover in place. That just looks and feels cheesy. I opted to buy the Amazon KFHD leather case that uses the magnetic closure system. It is perfect! The magnetic flap is exactly what I was looking for! In addition, the buttons work perfectly through the case.The experience of watching a movie on the 7"" screen isn't that great. I prefer watching movies on a larger TV. I also found that reading a book on the KFHD hurt my eyes almost immediately. The lighter background on a LCD causes more strain than the e-ink/pearl screen on the Kindle Touch/Paperwhite. So essentially the KFHD is really more useful for reading magazines, browsing the web, playing games, and perhaps watching a movie/listening to music on the go.The KFDH 7"" has a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor with only 1GB of RAM. I can detect that it is slower than my Samsung Galaxy S3 (1.5 GHz dual-core with 2GB RAM), as it scores only about 6,500 points in Antutu while my Galaxy S3 is at 11,000 points. The screen on the KFHD is crisp. I am able to read magazines using Zinio. In the full page view, the text can be too small although it is good enough for me to skim to find interesting articles.Speaking of Zinio, the Amazon Appstore is probably the sorriest excuse for a marketplace that I've seen. Google Play has far more updated apps. The same apps in the Amazon Appstore are sometimes outdated by several generations, or they simply aren't in the Appstore. I had to sideload Zinio onto my KFHD.I opted to use a regular USB charger, and it takes awhile to fully charge the battery. However, in standby mode it sips power. Another good aspect with the Amazon Onyx case is that the magnetic closure puts the Kindle to sleep (or rather turns off the screen) when the cover is closed without having to do anything else. The battery life is acceptable - the screen is what uses the most power.Overall: 4/5 stars. I have to admit that it is overpriced for what it is, there are better Android-powered tablets (Nexus 7) at the same price point with more hardware power. The Amazon Appstore is sorely lacking compared to Google Play. The 1.2 GHz processor is fairly slow, and there's only 1 GB RAM. The lack of a SD card slot is also a mistake. If you want to read magazines without ever having to zoom in, the KFHD 8.9"" or a 10"" tablet is the answer, but I felt the 7"" is suitable because it is smaller, lighter, and easier to handle.Bottom line is that if you're interested primarily in Amazon content, the Kindle Fire HD is for you. The 8.9"" is best for reading magazines but the 7"" suits me fine. If you plan to root the KFHD, you're better off just buying an Android Tablet like the Nexus 7. The Nexus 7 and other tablets have better hardware (more RAM, faster processor, SD card slot, etc...) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4356, 4370)"

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,How is the time?,"Simply put, the Chromecast is fantastic. For the price, especially if you got in when they had the Netflix deal, this was almost impossible to pass up. Now, I'm a bit of a tech guy and have a computer plugged into every TV in my house, but this is still great for sharing YouTube and Netflix videos to the big screen without having to go switch inputs and grab my keyboard. I like the CEC support to turn on and change the input of your TV automatically the most.I can only give 4 stars out of 5 though because while the product is fantastic and the price is right, it still hasn't been adopted by many other apps than the initial few. Hulu recently added support, but Google has been fairly quiet about the product since announcing it. Still, even if you just used it for YouTube, Netflix, and/or Hulu, it's so cheap it's still a great buy. I'd really like to see Google use this technology more though and it would be worth a full 5 stars.For those comparing with Apple TV or Airplay, I don't see any reason for these products to co-exist as they do very similar tasks. The difference though is that using Airplay requires you to buy an Apple TV at minimum which is a good bit more expensive. Simply put though, if you're an Apple person with a lot of Apple products, you may be happier with an Apple TV using Airplay. Otherwise, this cheaper alternative can perform similarly if not even better once Google and other companies (hopefully) start to utilize it more. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1468, 1482)"
B002J9HBIO,electronics,Does the camera glove has no extra pockets?,"On my old laptop bag, the handles started coming apart so I was looking for a new one. I wanted something a little smaller that still had a front pocket for extras such as an iPod, the laptop power cord, a small external hard drive, and a couple cables. This case was in my price range and is well reviewed. The very first review and a few others I read mentioned that this bag was a little small and potentially a tight fit. I have a Lenovo e420 14"" laptop and decided to buy the 16"" bag so I would have a little extra room.When the case arrived the first thing I noticed is the bag is very slim. My 14"" Lenovo e420 fits comfortably in the bag leaving a little extra room so it does not scrape the zipper. If I had gone with the 14"" bag I have no doubts that there would have been issues with the laptop rubbing on the zipper. I have enough extra room to put a manila folder with some paperwork in the pocket along with the laptop itself. The second/middle zipper has several pockets inside that are good for storing small things. In my case, some SD cards and thumb drives. In front of those small pockets there is room for the laptop power cord, a small usb external hard drive, my iPod Classic, and a couple small misc cables. With all those items it makes the pocket a little bulgy and doesn't leave much room for anything else. The very front zippered pocket on the bag is really tiny. I have a cellphone charger in it and that is a very snug fit by itself.Honestly had I known the bag was practically a notebook sleeve with a front pocket I probably would've opted for a different bag. That being said I'm going to use this one for awhile and see if it grows on me. I like that the bag is smaller than my old one and that its very lightweight material. It feels like it will provide some decent protection and the material of the bag itself won't damage or scratch my belongings inside it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1897, 1911)"

B001SER47O,electronics,How do you rate the video?,"My daughter ordered this with birthday money after researching cameras online. It was one of the cameras recommended by Ken Rockwell, and one of the few low-end digitals that still has an optical viewfinder. My pragmatic daughter insisted on this, since sometimes in bright light the LCD is hard to view.The camera is tiny! Even after seeing a picture of the camera hiding behind a credit card I was not prepared for how small it is! The buttons are recessed and the whole camera slips easily into a pocket without snagging on anything. Despite its small size, the LCD is easy to view, and the buttons are very usable.The second moment of awe was powering on. The camera turns on and off very quickly! Some other point-and-shoot digitals we've had have had a considerable delay before they are ready to shoot, extending the lens and running through the self-test of the software. This camera is not quite instantaneous, but it's very fast!The pictures are good quality, and it's easy to switch between photo and video mode. Another fun surprise was that the auto-focus places the camera in macro mode when you try to focus on something right in front of the lens. In short, the features of the camera are very well done.I can't comment on the battery life or sturdiness/durability because we've only had the camera for a short time and my daughter is fastidious about taking out the battery when she isn't actively using the camera.

B005KOZNBW,electronics,What is the quality of support?,"First off this is a great little gadget. I bought the Roku 2XS and heavily considered the Apple TV before this one (I have an Iphone and Ipad). I ended up returning the Roku, not ordering the Apple TV and keeping this one. Why? Please read along.FYI, you can jump right into the PROS and CONS if you don't want to see my rationale and comparison of WD to Roku and AppleTVMy decision on buying and keeping the WD was heavily influenced by its claim (and now after trying it for a month, I declare it ""truth"") that it plays any format of video you throw at it. It does. AVI, MKV, MP4, MPEG, anything. You throw it in, it plays to perfection. On comparison, AppleTV barely plays anything non-Apple supported and the Roku was miserable in playing video formats. Other than every other MKV it played NOTHING. Deal breaker.If your main or primary goal is streaming I would suggest the Roku over the WD. Especially if you have Amazon Prime (not supported by WD). It is sleeker, has a much more elegant remote and a smaller box.Coming back the WD: The main function, streaming, works flawlessly in HD setting (at my internet speed of 20MBPs download, 3MBPS upload). Navigation menu is easy to navigate and is well laid out. Not as good as Roku,I might add.Overall it is good but not great and a quick recap as to why is below in the PROS and CONSPROS+ Plays ANYTHING you throw at it via USB+ HD playback is excellent+ You can skip to ""desired time"" as opposed to going with the 2X to 16X forward speed. Sounds trivial but is very helpful when tried+ Has a free remote APP you can download from the APP store (don't know about Android)CONS- No Amazon Prime (I don't get this. Understand AppleTV not offering it but why WD, why?)- Terrible remote like the 1980's VHS player remotes) . You need to push the keys really harr and have close to perfect line of sight to the box- Netflix app asks you to confirm your account every other day. Annoying. Needs an update to fix this.Finally, which player is better fit for who:- WD : If you have multiple formats of videos to watch on your TV and use Netflix, hulu, hulu+ or vudu (plus pandora and a few other music stations) this is for you- Roku : If you want to watch all the mainstream streaming services and Amazon Prime and not care for USB video playback of various video formats, this is for you- AppleTV: If you want to remain in the Apple universe, have an extremely slick gadget (and remote), have the ability to mirror your IPAD or IPhone on your HDTV, and you don't care for Amazon Prime then this is for youOverall, I am very happy with my purchase despite it comes with a remote, that at first look wants you wonder what the heck they were thinking.

B005HMO6A6,electronics,What do you think of the artistic design?,"I really don't have anything new to report after reading many of the reviews, I just wanted to add my comments.I purchased the Airbender keyboard and case to compare it to the Logitech aluminum case. WIth the latter, I used the keyboard infrequently however every time that I went to use it, I took a considerable number errors and miskeys until I got into the swing of it. My opinion is that the keys are just to close together on the keyboard and hence I regularly ended up pushing both adjacent keys.Enter the Airbender. The first thing I notice, and looked for, was a tad of spacing between the keys and was pleased to see it. This is achieved I feel by reducing the size of the keys from 16mm on the Logitech to 14mm on the Airbender. Hence there is, in my opinion,  just enough space to allow me to type without constant errors. I did find that the right shift key was a little awkwardly spaced to the right of the ""page up"" key and it is a little small, however with time I am sure I will get used to it.As previously mentioned by other reviewers, the clamshell mechanism is a little fiddly to get it situated however, when it is finally set up, bingo! I especially like the way it can be either landscape or portrait or anything in-between if you so desire unlike other clamshells on the market. The ability to be able to detach the iPad quickly from the keyboard is ingenious and useful although I did, again, find it a little fiddly re-attaching however I am sure practice will make perfect. Compared to the Logictech which, when the iPad is stowed away, is very sleek and has a nice look due to the aluminum case, the Airbender is a little more bulky however the practicality of the product outweighs the negative of this feature.I think I read that it was not possible to charge the iPad while the case is closed however mine seems to be able to do this without a problem. I also read that the auto off function using, I presume, magnets was spotty and I have to say I have also found this. That being said, I usually manually switch off my iPad and keyboard prior to closing the case so it is not an issue. In the case that I do forget, hopefully the timer auto off will work however I am not sure if this will happen if the case is linked with the bluetooth keyboard. Either way, this is certainly not a big issue in my mind.All in all, I think this is a well designed and thought out case. It is exactly what I needed and , although bulkier than the Logictech, I am very pleased I purchased it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants the benefit of a true keyboard as opposed to the screen keyboard. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2629, 2643)"

B007PRHNHO,electronics,How is it feel ?,"I'm actually writing this review with this keyboard and it only reminds me how great this keyboard is. I had purchased the Apple bluetooth keyboard for my original iPad but stopped using it after some time due to having to carry it around separately. I recently purchased the 4th generation iPad and saw this keyboard thanks to a banner ad from Amazon. I decided to give it a try.First, the keyboard itself has a great feel to it. Very easy to type and great feedback. The best feature of the keyboard has to be that it doubles as a smart case so no more carrying around a &#34;separate&#34; keyboard. It protects your iPad and attaches very nicely to it. Simply open this keyboard cover on the iPad and it slides nicely into the middle of the keyboard. It displays the iPad at a great angle for reading and fits pretty securely into the slot. The slot also seems to have a magnetic connection to it to hold the iPad more securely as well.Connecting the keyboard via bluetooth is of course very simple. It also has an on/off switch which is nice for battery preservation. It's also a better switch than what Apple's had where I couldn't easily tell if the keyboard was on/off.The keyboard charges with a standard (yes standard) USB mini connection. The cable that comes with the keyboard only hooks up to a USB port on say a computer and not a wall adapter but that was ok for me. The cable is also VERY short. But that was ok for me because I have simply been using a different USB mini power cable that plugs into the wall that I use to charge my bluetooth headset for my phone. One less charger to carry around. Also, so far the keyboard seems to hold a charge for a LONG time. I haven't run out of battery yet nor even seen the low battery indicator the keyboard claims to have. I've gone 7 days without charging and it's been fine. Now during that time I wasn't using it all day but still...I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard. The feel of the keyboard is awesome, the fact that it connects so well to iPad as a Smartcase makes it like you aren't even carrying a keyboard, and it adds protection to your iPad screen.

B001S4OTS6,electronics,How to receiver size?,"I bought it at Sam's.  Even though I wasn't actively looking for a keyboard, it met two requirements I had for an HTPC keyboard to replace the existing one.1 - The mouse is not targeted to right handers.  As a left hander, I am continually frustrated by Mice that are unusable for me.2 - Range - I had been using a MS Laser 5000 keyboard and mouse on the HTPC.  The range was so limited that one had to sneak up on the computer to get things to work.  The advertised range for the Wireless Desktop 3000 was 30 feet.  That caught my attention so I purchased one and sure enough if works fine from across the room.  That in itself makes the purchase worthwhile.They also advertise that the mouse works on any surface and it seems to.  I can sit on the sofa and use the mouse on the arm of the sofa with no problems.  However, the 5000 mouse is equally responsive on any surface, it just doesn't have the range.Unfortunately, the keyboard design has changed from the Wireless 5000.  The key layout has changed enough that I wouldn't want to have to switch between the 3000 and 5000 for normal use (both of my desktops use the 5000) but for the HTPC where we don't do a lot of typing the new keyboard is fine.The ESC, function, PrtScrn, ScrLock, and Pause keys have been miniaturized as have all of the dedicated function keys.  The keys are also aligned straight across the keyboard as opposed to the curved design of the 5000.  One would thing that the ergonomics of keyboards would be pretty well understood by now but we keep changing them with every new iteration.From my perspective, if you like your current keyboard and mouse there is no reason to make an impulse purchase (I bought mine at Sam's on impulse mainly for the range).  However if you need a new keyboard on have an old mouse that's finicky of some surfaces, this keyboard may well suit your needs.Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1896, 1910)"

The small profile of the box is nice but left the designers with only one real option when cramming ports into this thing, that was to put one of the inputs on the side and the output port on the other side.  Makes it tricky to find a place to put it as HDMI cables are not known for their ability to flex a great deal.Pros?  Smaller is good except for the con I mentioned.  The remote works well but I rarely use it.  The auto-detect feature works exceptionally well.  There is no signal lose or degredation that I can see.  I'm using Mediabridge HDMI Cables with it (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019EHU8G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12) and they seem to work really well.  Cannot complain about this purchase at all.

At first, I wasn't sure if I'd like its key action as much as a traditional keyboard or a laptop keyboard (it actually falls somewhat in between the two). But after my first few minutes typing on it, it was clear that it has great action! I am actually able to type very quickly on this keyboard, much more so than traditional &#34;full&#34; action keyboards and definitely more so than standard laptop keyboards.I love the various function keys that are available. Also, I love the battery life in this keyboard. The documentation from Logitech said you get about 15 hours use between charging. I thought that was going to be a bit short--but I'll give it a try. After the first charge, I was able to use it for almost 2 months before I needed to charge it again. And now, 3 years later, I only charge it about once a month. So no complaints there.I would definitely purchase this keyboard again. However, next time, I might consider the solar powered one so I don't have to worry about charging at all.

B00834SJNA,electronics,How is the usb?,"We expect our computers to do a lot.  They store our files, they help us to communicate, we use them in our work, and much more.  Our computers have become an essential part of our lives, as necessary as a car or a microwave.  In some cases, a computer may be more important than some of the things we previously considered key devices in our life.As our expectations of our computers has grown, so too have our expectations regarding memory.  Just a short time ago, we thought 100's of megabytes (or even megabytes) was a lot of memory, only to find that even a terabyte could be filled with memories and entertainments.  Expansion drives provide a relatively cost effective way of adding storage to a computer, particularly if the computer is doing everything you need it to do with respect to processing power.This particular expansion drive seems to be a cost-effective way to add a lot of memory to a computer.  This drive is compatible with USB 3.0 and includes a USB 3.0 cable.  The transfer speed of USB 3.0 is about ten times faster than the previous, widespread standard, USB 2.0.  The faster speed means that, if you have a USB 3.0 interface on your computer, this expansion drive will appear to operate nearly as fast as your internal drive with respect to transferring files, except for very large files.  As one example, we loaded a movie (not high resolution) onto this drive and played the movie flawlessly from the drive.  The only flaw with the transfer speed is that it says nothing about the speed of the hard drive itself, which I was unable to figure out.  For the kinds of files I typically save, it was sufficiently fast.This drive is plug and play.  Connect the drive to your computer, and seconds later, it shows up as a drive on your directory.  The drive operates just like any other folder on your drive.  You may readily move files into and out from the drive, or launch files directly from the drive.  You should eject or shut down the drive before disconnecting it from your computer.While this drive seems to have a lot going for it, there are a couple of potential issues or annoyances, and one possible concern.This drive lays flat.  I have one other Seagate 2 TB external drive that stands up vertically.  I prefer the vertical arrangement because it takes up less space on the desk where I typically use the hard drive.  I have accidentally pulled the vertical hard drive over because I forgot to disconnect the cable, which is clearly not an issue with this hard drive, though that particular issue has not happened to me recently with my vertical external drive.Another possible problem is that this drive gets warm if it is used for very long.  One reason this could be an issue is the location where the drive is used.  Many people are heading to the desert in support of various U.S. initiatives and taking an expansion drive with them.  Since air conditioning is not ubiquitous in many of these locations, overheating is a potentially significant concern.Yet another incipient issue is decreased life.  I have seen some concerns regarding this particular drive and a shortened life, but the reports seem to be preliminary and may be isolated failures.  I think there is insufficient data at this point to be a cause for alarm, but neither am I sufficiently comfortable with the reliability of this drive to recommend it without a least a bit of reservation.  I suggest monitoring reviews on Amazon or doing some additional research to see whether these drives suffer from a shortened life.One thing I find troubling is the location of vent holes in the case.  I am a big fan of venting for electronics that have the potential to get warm.  This drive has vent holes on the bottom and on the back, but that does not necessarily optimize flow of air through the drive.  While the position of these holes prevents spilled fluids from readily entering the drive, the position of the holes is less than optimum from an airflow perspective, which may be part of the reason this drive seems to get warm.I now have several external drives.  I think the primary reason is my paranoia that highly valuable files will be lost because of some unforeseen and catastrophic circumstance.  I can replace my computer reasonably quickly, but I cannot replace the files on the computer.  Thus, I have an external hard drive set up for automatic backup, another hard drive available for transporting files, and a hard drive backup to the primary backup.  Yes, I have many duplicate files, but at least I minimize the risk that the files will be lost permanently.  The particular hard drive appears to be cost-effective and small.  I am a little concerned about the life of the drive, but it will take me time to learn whether that is an issue.  Until then, this drive is now an important part of my life.Enjoy!

B0088CJT4U,electronics,What is the light device?,"I have been using an old Linksys wireless router for nearly the past 10 years.  For the most part the router served me well enough to not want to replace it.  There were occasional instances in which the router would drop the connection during internet surfing or more importantly online game play, but I chalked it up as having to do with my ISP instead of my equipment.  Also sometimes this router would get in a funky state and i would be unable to connect to my DSL modem but that was resolved by unplugging it for about 30 seconds and turning it back on.  These issues were annoying but minor and infrequent occurrences.  I have tried other routers such as D-link and Netgear, but I did not like the interface enough to replace my trusty old Linksys.  I recently got the opportunity to get a new router from a company I never heard of before, TP-Link and I figured why not?Off the bat, I would like to say I do like the updated look of this router.  The glossy black finish and the large indicator lights on the front is a big upgrade in look from my 10 year old Linksys router.Looks aside, when I first got this router, honestly, I wasn't too confident that would would be as good as my Linksys, but I decided to give it a chance and if all else failed I could always go back to the Linksys.  However after using it for about a month I am very impressed with my new router and its features that are not present on my Linksys.  Since using this router I have not experienced any disconnections during online game play and while I won't say its ""faster"", my online games seem to play much smoother than before.I did really want to setup the TP-Link using the CD because of past experiences with using included CD's to set hardware up, but in hindsight the CD Setup was great and did not cause much issue at all.  After setting up the router using the CD and trying to connect to the internet for the first time, my ISP directed me to their page to setup a new username and password to use with the router.  I thought this for sure would cause an issue, but it didn't which was a relief.  To make things even better after the setup process was complete the router created a .txt document that listed all my settings, username/password and network keys for future use.Another thing I like about the TP-Link router is that the interface is just as if not more intuitive and user friendly as my Linksys was.  One of the things I disliked about the Netgear and D-link routers was that the interface was terrible making simple things hard to find and simple tasks harder to do than it should have been.  With the TP-Link router interface, every menu is easy to find and its functions are clearly explained.A couple of features I like about the TP-Link are the Dual band capability and the USB port on the back of the router which allows you to connect a USB device such as a printer or a External Hard drive for all computers on the network to share.  Neither of these features were present on my Linksys.I originally wasn't going to use the Dual Band setup but since it was so easy to set up and configure I figured it couldn't hurt to try it out.  I have my laptop, cell phone, and my son's 3DS connected to the 2.4GHZ network, while I have my XBOX and PS3 connected to the 5GHz network.  Since using this new configuration I haven't had any disconnections on my XBOX or PS3 while playing them online.  As I said before when disconnections occurred in the past I thought it was my ISP, but now I haven't had any disconnections since, maybe it WAS my old router that was the culprit.The feature I really like is the shared USB feature.  There is a USB port on the back of the router that you can connect a USB device to that can be shared across your network.  Since my printer was already shared over my network, I decided to use this port to connect my external hard drive so I could perform my system backups more easily.  Prior to this setup, I was using Buffalo Link stations and Drive stations for my backups which didn't always work properly (especially with the LinkStation) so I ended up slacking off on backing up because it became too much trouble.  However now with the USB share feature backups are as easy as connecting the USB drive to the router and mapping a network drive on each computer to that device.  Backups for me are extremely easy and I can do them every night without any issue.  I have noticed that the transfer speed during my backups seems to be slower than they were with my Linkstation, however since my backups are usually done at night when no one is on the computer this doesn't bother me too much.In conclusion, since using this new router I don't even know its there which is a good thing.  The transition from using my Linksys router to the TP-Link was smooth and mostly painless. One star deduction for the slow transfer speeds, but other than that no big issues. I still have my Linksys in case things change, but I am hoping that the TP-Link gives me many years of service as my old router did. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5036, 5050)"

Due to the poor quality of the mouse I received along with other reviews having similar issues, I decided to go with a different mouse then to try my luck again with this one.Issues:Did not track accurately.  Tracking is sporadic.  It would appear to work properly, then not at all.Did not click accurately.  Had to click several times for the mouse to work.Tried changing mouse pads, no pad, putting a piece of paper underneath.. nothing helped.  The logitech software was the current, updated version.  What's sad is that when I went to return it, the tech at Staples (where I bought it) tried to test it and it wouldn't even work on his PC.  At least on mine, it somewhat worked.  The tech's PC did recognize it and yes, the mouse was turned on.  The pointer just wouldn't even move.I had major challenges with finding a mouse to work for my needs.  I finally settled on this one due to the following:Right size for my small handsErgonomicSomewhat ambidextrous.  I am left handed but typically use the right hand for the mouse (gee I wonder why that is.. gripe, gripe, gripe about the lack of good left handed mice!)  I could get away with using it in my left hand if needed (due to nerve pain I have to switch between my left and right hand as needed) but not for long term use.Had the unifying receiverFeatures: Had all the features I could possibly want or need.  I loved the hyper scroll and application switcher.  The buttons were unobtrusive and I never hit them unintentionally.I tested several other unifying receiver mice made by logitech and this was the one that fit my ergonomic needs the best.  TheLogitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Macdoes have a good selection of features but it was too small.  TheLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Macwas too big and not at all for left handed use.  TheLogitech LX7 Cordless Optical Mouse - Dark Blue ( 931395-0403 )is my backup mouse and is OK and theLogitech Wireless Mouse M505 (Black)was the next choice if just going off of ergonomics and comfort, but for the price and lack of features I decided to look outside of Logitech.What I found instead was theMicrosoft Explorer Mini Mouse.  This mouse fit similarly to the M705 and it is MUCH lighter and MUCH cheaper!  It also works better in my left hand then the M705.Like I said in my title, I wanted to love this mouse but it was so defective I didn't even want to try a second one.

But of course, with Prime, you also get a lot of free movies.Now, I'm not saying that the movies from THIS service are necessarily better than the movies from than THAT service -- there are probably more films available right now from THAT service for sure -- but, it is getting close enough that it was time to stop paying the seven bucks a month.But there was another issue.  I have a streaming box from, well, you know who.  Now, I really like their devices.  I have a phone, a tablet, and a streaming box from them (similar to Roku).  But they don't let you install apps on that device, and there is no pre-built app for Amazon's streaming service.  So, that required me to buy a new Roku box, which comes preloaded with an Amazon streaming app.  (No no.  Jailbreaking, even if it would work, is a horrific idea from a security standpoint.)I almost made the mistake of ordering the ""wrong"" Roku box from Amazon.  When I initially looked at the quick spec list, I was disappointed since it didn't appear to me that any of them had both wireless and wired Internet capabilities.  But luckily, I stuck with it and realized that the most expensive box was the ONLY one that had ethernet.  This is important to me because, while I have a wireless network, it is of course almost always better to connect your devices through wires, particularly through Gigabit ethernet, which I have throughout my house.The setup was relatively easy, although the hardest part:  getting the batteries in the remote!  The battery relase button must be pushed down; I have to say that I think that this is the first time I've ever seen this.  After that, it was just some quick registration with a couple of web sites to enable movie playback.First movie:  ""Marnie.""  Now, I reviewed that film on this site, and while I didn't completely like it (you may read my review to see why), the digital transfer was fantastic.

I don't load any songs onto the player itself. Instead I use a 16GB MicroSD card which transfers music much faster and stores much more. I don't have anywhere near 16GB of music, but it's nice to have the option for expandable storage rather than be stuck with however many gigs Apple allows you. Transferring music works just like transferring files to and from a flash drive (because it basically is, especially if you use a MicroSD card). Pull up your music library folder and your storage folder and transfer as necessary. Easy as pie. There will be no doubt as to which songs are on your device.This player is quite small but never uncomfortable to use. The screen is bright enough to be clearly visible in sunlight and the colors contrast so that the text stands out. The buttons are solid and have been quite durable. I greatly prefer having a solid directional pad than a touch circle or touch screen. Separate power and volume buttons seal the deal for great controls. The interface is clean and simple, giving you easy access to sorting music by artist, album, or song, as well as a radio and audio books for those who are interested.I only have two problems with the player that I easily get around. It does not read MP4s, so I use a free M4a to MP3 Converter that I got from CNET.com. And because the player sorts by artist or album, not both at the same time, you'll end up with albums spread across multiple artists. For example, I have an Eric Clapton collection that spans his whole career. The album includes songs from Cream, Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominoes, and songs featuring BB King or J.J. Cale. Each one is labeled as a new artist separate from Eric Clapton, so to listen to their songs I have to go to the artist rather than have the whole album filed under Clapton. Minor complaint but Zune did it and I liked that.Easily the best player I have owned. If mine ever dies, I would buy a new one of the same model immediately.

It's not louder, but the sound quality is better in mid- to high-frequency. T325 is more on low-frequency sound, which mixes into road and wind noises.Bad: After using T505 for a week I realized how much T325 has been improved on human interface from T305/T505. T325 has auto connect, big call button, and can speak names when a call arrives. T505 has stiff and small buttons, don't do auto connect, and can only speak telephone numbers. As for voice dialing, T505's sound is tiny; it's hard to hear to whom the phone is dialing to. Voice dialing is not very reliable on both T325 and T505, but with T325 I know to whom it's calling and can stop it if the calling name is wrong.FM broadcasting: Only T505 has this feature. The sound is pretty good. However, it searches for a free FM frequency whenever it powers on. That means the frequency always changes. For this reason, it's extremely troublesome to use this feature. I guess if I don't turn T505 off, it's less an issue. However, I don't like the idea of having a tiny FM broadcasting station working over my head all the time. :-)So I decided to return it, and probably will get another T325 or the roadster.

Aren't we discussing image quality or are we discussing something else?Given the very large images produced by modern DSLRs, I can crop the image from this 50mm and get the zoom effect I need given the minimum zoom of 50mm (times crop factor). I can also place this lens on my Elan 7 film camera and get spectacular results. I use this lens more and more and zoom using my physical zoom (feet) and digital zoom (Photoshop or Aperture or any image editing software). The results are always great. No, I cannot print to 40x60 inches if I crop from this lens, but I am not planning to do that anyway.When I shoot a wedding (not bridal portraits, I use the 85mm prime for that) the photos made using this lens are always the best and always the favorites. I know it does not have the little red ring around it but that is just to show other photographers that you are hip and with it, not necessarily to get better images and certainly not based on the money-to-image-quality ratio. Nope, buying a more expensive camera or a more expensive lens will NOT make you a better photographer. Using a prime lens, however, like this very affordable option, will certainly improve your images.The cons are obvious: low build quality. This means that the lens is likely to last for only ten years or so, judging by the fact that other Canon primes (and all Canon lenses in general) are notoriously and incredibly reliable (the more expensive f/1.4 version of this lens a notable exception, but still very, very, very reliable).The sum of all my comments is but this: for the money, there is no finer nor more useful lens for your Canon EOS Camera.

B0043T7FXE,electronics,Does this product much better?,"I purchased this trackball January of last year (2011). Since then, it's put up with 10-12 hour per day usage. I wouldn't buy a different one, even if there was another of its type on the market.Pros:- Thumb ball design- Battery life is amazing (plus ships with a name brand battery)- Programmable buttons- Storage compartment on the mouse for the receiverCons:- Wireless (some would list this as a pro, but I really prefer a wired mouse. If your desk gets as dirty as mine, you'll understand why the first time you lose it)- Tracks get dirty quickly- Troubleshooting software requires a mouse -.-Overall, this is a great mouse, if only a little overpriced. But this is the only option, so I suppose Logitech would jack the price up a bit. If you're like me, and have been using this type of mouse since before you were potty trained, you'll want to get it. The range is about 15 feet, assuming no obstacles, and the response time is good enough for average gamers and home users. But really, if you're comparing response times, you should be going for a wired mouse (usually).Just a note on Logitech's support. I've had mixed experiences with Logitech's support, having been an original Revue owner. Recently though, I had to put in for the warranty on this device, as it was acting up and losing connection when it was used for long periods of time. Their support times were amazing, and after going through a few troubleshooting steps and giving them some personal info, they put in for a replacement. Four business days later, and I just plugged in the mouse a short while ago. That is incredible in my opinion.TL;DR: If you're used to a thumb ball, you have no other choice. Go buy it.

B00DVFLJDS,electronics,What is your feeling?,"I got one that was an ""open box"" item and the volume stopped working - the buttons and even settings wouldn't change the volume which had been set to the lowest setting (mute).  I tried turning off but then it didn't turn back on.  Took it back and it was replaced with a brand new one!Now I've had it for a while and have 3 accounts setup, one for myself, one for the wife and one restricted account for my 5 yr old.  The wife mainly watches videos (YouTube), son plays games and I play and surf.  Response is great although our internet connection is at tops 6Mbs so there are times when something that needs internet access may lag a bit.  I noticed one app that I play on my HTC One S always complains about the connection when I use the HTC phone, but on this tablet it just runs smoothly without every complaining - odd since they use the same WiFi connection.  The tablet response is good.The Android OS on this tablet is simple compared to my phone which has the HTC Sense version - not that the phone is ""hard"", but it may be why the phone seems a lot less responsive than this tablet.If you used any of the other OS (iOS, Win8, Firefox, etc...) then you will find the controls somewhat familiar.  Although there will be differences, they won't keep you from using the tablet.  You still have the apps you can download - some are free and some are paid apps.The volume control issue on the initial tablet seems to happen a bit as this one did the same, but I found out I could just change user accounts and it will work again - odd, but hopefully there will be an update that will prevent that from happening at all.Overall I am happy with the purchase and although there are a few things I wish it had (like expandable memory slot for a SD card for one, HDMI output for another), I think it's a great, fast and nice size for our first tablet.Update: Still have issue with ""mute"" getting stuck and having to swap accounts to get audio volume to function again.  But now also have an issue where the notification pull down bar (or whatever you want to call it) appears as we try to launch apps, swipe, or do anything.  We are having to power off and back on before it will work again.  Whatever they did with the latest release appears to have made the tablet worst than better and I've adjusted my rating accordingly.Update2: With the install of 4.4 KitKat, the screen problems appear to be gone now.  I haven't been using Mute a lot lately so not sure if that issue is also gone.Update3: And the problem is back!  Put a video on YouTube title Ematic vs Nexus 7.  The Ematic is a quad-core for $80 and in my opinion a better buy since it works (at least for now).  I'm going to see if Asus will take their paper weight back and give a refund.  This would be great if it worked correctly.Update4: Tablet's been with Asus for over two weeks.  RMA says waiting for customer confirmation ""swap"" so I called to find out what that meant and was told I will receive an email when Asus decides what to offer me.  Not a good experience at all.  You take a chance with these tablets that they will not work and you'll be stuck paying to send them back to Asus and wait for them to decide ""what to offer you"".Update4.1: May 30th received the replacement.  Asus sent a notice saying they shipped it and to check the ""courier"" site for updates but only listed ""TRUCKING"" as the courier with no tracking info.  On May 29th Fed Ex left a message saying they will be delivering a package that required a signature - that would have been hard to arrange if we were in a situation where no one would be home.  The item shipped from CA and not TX so I figured it must be a replacement unit and I was right as the serial # is different.  So far the replacement seems to be working.

B002C7481G,electronics,How is the processor?,"So I have had my iPad now for about a month. The bottom line for me is that the iPad has some strong points but, overall, is very limited in its usefulness. It might be well suited for someone in different circumstances but my scenario is that I have a small work laptop that is with me all day and I have a pocketable iPhone which is with me (almost) at all times. At home, I have the work laptop, another laptop and a desktop.Strengths* The iPad is a good digital photo frame. Not worlds better than others you can get, but it's good.* The iPad's greatest strength is with magazines. Magazines have never looked better than on an iPad, particularly photo-oriented magazines covering travel, sports or food. It is materially better than reading a physical magazine. For this purpose I might have wanted the iPad to be even bigger.* The iPad is a nicely compact tablet for web searches. You can do web searches, the page is bigger than your iPhone and the device doesn't take much room on the counter. That's handy.Weaknesses* The iPad does not replace a computer (or any other device). It is meant as a satellite device for people who have laptops, so for instance it doesn't have USB ports to load content directly onto the device. When we went on a trip we wanted to take the iPad instead of a laptop but we couldn't because you can't offload your pics from your camera directly to the iPad. Also, it is in my view not a good word processing platform, or in any case not as good as a compact laptop, so if you need to do actual work you still need your actual laptop. Bottom line: it is a ""third device,"" not a replacement for one of your current devices.* It is not really portable (for men). It doesn't fit in your pocket, so the average man (who doesn't carry a purse) will be leaving it at home.* It doesn't support Flash. The reality is that Flash is all over the web, so if your browser doesn't support it, it's inconvenient.* I can't imagine when I would watch a video on it. If I'm out and about I might watch a YouTube link on my iPhone. But if I am at home I'm sure I would rather watch on my internet-connected TV or on one of my PCs (all of which have larger screens). If I am traveling I probably wouldn't bring the iPad anyway.So for me the iPad is a niche device solving a small set of problems not well addressed by the iPhone-laptop combination, basically for reading magazines and doing the occasional web search. That's fine, but I am not sure it is worth $500-$800. It depends how flush you are I guess. Listening to music on the go is a mass market desire, as we saw with Walkman and later the iPod. Reading backlit magazines and having another way to do searches in the house are much more limited use cases. 3 million Apple fans have bought the device (including myself), but I will be surprised if it becomes a real mass market solution.

Anyway, this one is still going strong, and I don't think I've ever had to change the batteries since purchasing.It has a button on top below the scroll wheel that will let you make the scroll wheel either tactile so that it ""clicks,"" or free so that you can scroll super fast. Awesome feature. You can also program the thumb button- a nice feature. The mouse is a touch on the large side for me, but it feels nice in the hand. Sometimes the top button that controls the scroll wheel can get in the way, but it's really not a big deal to me- in fact, I usually just use it as a rest for my scrolling finger.As stated in other reviews, if you think the mouse is too heavy, you can actually remove a battery and it will still work.Overall, it's a great mouse that has held up longer than any of the others I've owned. Worth the money!EDIT (3-3-13): I've owned this mouse for about two years now, no issues. The scroll wheel still glides (or clicks, whichever you prefer) without issue, and no problems with any of the buttons.

I found online a PDF with instructions from my ISP giving me exact directions on how to allow the camera to operate freely on the network. I then typed the info from the instructions, rebooted the camera, and I WAS UP AND RUNNING.If connected to wifi, the new forwarding adress would not work, if not connected to wifi and running on 3G, the forwarding address WOULD work.BOTTOM LINE, MORAL OF THE STORY, I had everything I needed completed in less then a few hours!.

B0088CJT4U,electronics,How is it number ?,"You have read about what the router can do. I am not going to regurgitate it all back to you again, instead I will go over what stood out and what I had problems with when using this router in my network.As far as what good things stood out the router has 3 external antennas that are detachable allowing you to upgrade the antennas if you want. I like having antenna options. There are dedicated wireless and power on / off switches on the rear of router allowing easy rebooting and absolute control over the wireless signal. I was able to achieve my rated download and upload speeds from my ISP. I did not have to reboot the router because it locked up. The router runs really cool to the touch. There are wall mount slots on the bottom of the router. overall things generally work like they should.As far as what bad things stood out to me the router has a shiny black finish making it a fingerprint and dust magnet. There are no rubber feet on the bottom and it has a tendency to slide around on my desk. I dislike the bright blue LEDs that are angled up on the front panel.  I only need to see what is up at a quick glance directly at the router. I don't need the router to be constantly attracting my attention even when I am not directly looking at it. I don't like the fact that I can't see all LAN and Wireless clients along with their MAC and IP Addresses listed on a page. The wireless signal strength is not as strong as that from my Netgear WNDR3700v1.  Placing my cell phone back in my bedroom in the same exact spot swapping the routers in the same spot on my desk and measuring the signal using Wi-Fi Analyzer I measured the following:TP-Link 2.4GHz -76 dBm and 5GHz -88dBm vs Netgear 2.4GHz -65 dBm and 5GHz -84dBm.So my older Netgear with internal antennas seemed to have a better signal between those spots. I also had this weird problem where I had a Seagate Wireless Plus drive connected to the router via wireless. When I would do file transfers from a wired PC on the network to the Seagate drive the other devices on the network (wired or wireless) would slow to a crawl. I haven't gotten to the bottom of what that problem was yet so it could be the drive or the router at this point. I will have to do further testing in the future.I did not have a problem setting up the router. I have been through a lot of routers in my time. If you are new to configuring a router you may need some help figuring out what does what. Each page has a help section to the right of it. It is nice that it is there but you sometimes get that problem with a not so smooth translation to English so you aren't quite sure what they mean. You can figure most things out but some things are tough because of the translation and limited info.Overall not the most impressive router in my eyes but it is OK. I have had to test routers before that just wouldn't function for any period of time, at least this one can perform its core functions while maybe not near the top of what I would hope for, at least it does it reliably. Remember too that routers are a moving target with firmware updates, some things might get better and some things might get worse in the future. If you can get one for the right price it might be worth a look to you if you are in the market for a router.Update: I removed a complaint about no guest wireless. As support pointed out to me in the comments a new firmware came out after I started using the router to review it. The new firmware has guest networks for wireless along with several other fixes and improvements. So as I said a moving target and things can get better. I am happy to see active support for this router. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3657, 3671)"
B0052YFYFK,electronics,How is the quality?,"I'm completely satisfied with this purchase.  This wireless headset is the most comfortable set of headphones, of any kind, that I've ever used.  It's a little odd looking, yes, but function and comfort are my priorities in this case.  In fact, I chose the white version because I want it to be obvious to those around me that I have headphones on, and I'm not ignoring them or talking to myself!  I can pull out one ear bud, if someone is speaking to me and I don't have to deal with a long tangled cord to retrieve it and pop it back into my ear.  This is one reason I like this design so much: the cords are short and easy to manage.Honestly, I don't get what the magnetic spots are about?  I only seat the earbuds in the little magnetic pods when I'm hanging them up to charge, if ever.The majority of the product sits around the back of your neck (if I'm wearing it right), so the weight is not on your head or ears, and you barely notice the thing is there at all.  I wear it around my neck,let the ear-buds dangle; when a call comes in, the headset vibrates, and I can quickly pop one or two of the buds in.  There is a button on the left side to answer/hangup. People on the other end tell me the sound is great, even when I'm in a noisy room, or on a windy patio.  The volume control is also on the left side, as is the on off toggle, and the charging port.  I like that this product comes with an actual plug-in AC cord, not another USB thing that needs a special adapter or computer to charge it. Also (I think) the port looks like a common generic mini-usb size, that should be easy to replace if you lose the original.  I hate all those propriety cords!I bought these mostly, so I could pair it with my iPad and watch TV or Movies, while in a room with others who don't care to listen to what I'm watching.  I can get up and walk away, wash some dishes and continue listening without being tethered by wired headphones.  It's especially nice for news shows, where you can keep following without even needing to see the visual at all.It was easy to pair up with my ipad or iphone.  Just turned on the bluetooth on my devices settings, the LG headphones appeared in the list, and I clicked ""connect.""  Within seconds, I heard a few little beeps in my ear, confirming the headset was connected.  The few times that it didn't connect right away, I simply flipped the on/off switch (on the left side of the headset)once or twice, and my device suddenly connected to it.The sound quality is just great for phone calls or listening to a TV show or Movie.  No interference issues whatsoever.  Nice and clear.  Love the controls right there on either side of your collarbone.I didn't get these to listen to music, or even make phone calls, but I like them so much that I use them for both of those functions quite often.  With regular headphones, I hate having to look at the screen and swipe/tap to pause, jump to the next song, or change the volume. Somehow I always accidentally tap something I didn't mean to! But I've discovered that I can control my iPhone without even looking at it, (repeat or jump to the next song) by using the controls on the headset.  FYI: the round button on the right side will Play/Pause music on your iphone/iPad even if you weren't already listening to music.  The rocker type control on the right side will jump forward/ repeat/ jump backward to the next song on the playlist, or in your music library.As far as the sound quality goes for music-listening:  eh. shrug. I'm not sure.  It's fine, is all I can say.  Not awesome.  Not tin-ey.  But I don't think they sound as good as my skull-candy earbuds for cranking up the music.  It's not what I bought these for, so I have no complaints.  I don't want to crank up anything when I'm wearing these, since I need to be aware of what is going on around me, when I'm watching my son, driving or shopping.  (Don't get all fired up now ... I rarely listen to music on headphones when I'm driving!  But I DO use them to hear driving directions from my iPhone, without having to turn down the car stereo, or bother other passengers in the car).I was pretty skeptical when I ordered the LG headset, but after using it for a few weeks now ... it's definitely a keeper.  I love them!  The only reason I didn't rate it five stars, is because the sound quality is fine, but it would be nice if it was great. But minus one star for the lousy instructions. I don't even remember if there was an instruction sheet provided.  But I do recall having to just wing-it and figure out the operation on my own.  FYI for those also wondering: Charge them up first, it doesn't take long.* LEFT SIDE: on/off swith, charging port, volume rocker and phone controls.* RIGHT SIDE: Music controls: Play/Pause Button.

In order to use with Windows, you do in fact have to download the HFS+ driver from the Seagate website and reformat the drive (at least, this drive wasn't recognized by my PC running Windows 7). Of course if you are a Windows-only user, you probably would not even consider this product because of the name ""Backup Plus for Mac"".

B001EZYMF4,electronics,How do you get so high?,"Just really getting into ear phone, ear buds. Recently purchased an I Pad 2 and my son loaned me a pair of  unnamed earbuds. All  I can see is a S on the end of each bud. I was surprised  at how good they sound.My family owns an  iMac, Mac Pro Book, two iPhones and four IPods. Also own one hellava home  theater system. High end Harman Kardon AVR coupled to a Klipsch RF 7  horn loaded speaker system in a 7.1 configuration, Oppo Blu Ray hooked up to a top of the line 50 inch Panasonic Plasma. The Klipsch 12 inch sub literally shakes the pics on the wall. You can feel the bass in the pit of your belly.All that that being said is just to establish I know a little about music and the potential of how it can sound comng from quality equipment. My musical taste are wide, but at heart I am a  R & B purest loving great and funky bass lines. I just opened and hooked the Sennheiser CX  300 II buds up to my IPad II.First impression is they don't sound any better than the buds  my son loaned me. What is annoying so far is they are itching my inner ear canal.  The other buds don't do that.  I just switched them out to recheck again they definitely itch, not a good thing. I do detect an improvement in bass and the tremble is too shrill. I can see ear fatigue coming already. I understand music is recorded across a broad spectrum using various techniques. When you factor in the time span of my music collection, late 1960s until now, one can see it takes versatility to handleball of the content. I can attest that while the music is playing you cannot hear anything outside. My wife was watching a DVD and I could not hear a sound. In fact the bass sound waves fooled me because I could feel them in my belly, but I could not hear anything.I am well aware of burn in as my Klipsch speaker system required it and indeed over time they sounded better. I hope this is the same with these buds. I am not saying they are bad buds at all. I am saying the verdict is still out. At the price point $24, Idon' t see a mistake. Time will tell and I will report my findings as objectively as I can................................................................................................................................................................................................................As promised have had time for burn in and yes they needed several hours of play time to do that. With that said I am a R&B; fanatic. I love the bass runs in great R & B songs. These buds expose the  imperfections  in older recordings. However they handle the newer recorded music wonderfully. Listening to Michael McDonald's, I Second That Emotion is a treat. The bass is deep and clean, the midrange is good also. On the Temptations, Beauty's Only Skin Deep, Jamerisons bass licks are clean, but this is an old recording and these buds reveal the limitations of the equipment.I will definately purchase another pair of this brand.

I've noticed that the smooth texture of the cooler's base and many ventilated holes makes it harder for dust to collect. Several coolers I've owned and seen have had the problem of getting too dusty. Not a problem here.- The two fans give you the option to move them around, placing them wherever you'd like to place it. This is an ingenious feature because now you can move the fans to where you need it most. This is great, considering notebook cooler designs have always been stationary.- Overall good design. The angle and strength of the cooler is excellent and provides hours of comfort.

B003VAM32E,electronics,What do you think about grip?,"The Logitech G700 gaming mouse is by far one of the most desirable mice I have ever owned. I had upgraded from a 6 year old Logitech Performance Lazer mouse, which still works for the most part, but some of the buttons are hit and miss. A lot of the functionality and the like for the G700 have already been reviewed in the comments so I won't bore you with repeated like to like reviews. What I will be focusing on is it's battery life in fine detail.The Logitech G700 comes with a 1.2v AA 1,900 mAh eneloop brand rechargeable battery. It is rated, according to the manual and double checked by Logitech support team, that the mouse can function on a full charge with continual use between 8-10 hours of battery life. That's right ladies and gentlemen. A retailed value Logitech mouse of $99 will last you 8-10 hours on a full charge with its included battery. Ridiculous you say? Well you are spot on. One could easily spend $20 bucks on a cheap mouse on any brand and get 2-3 months of battery life. Sure it would not have the Logitech label on it, would not have the 13 programmable buttons and some other fancy stuff but bottom line you would not have to recharge the battery every day, or even every week with a mouse rated to run 2-3 months on a single battery. So lets just come to realization that the battery life on this mouse is extremely awful, probably the worst I have ever seen in the history of wireless mice. While talking to the Logitech support team they stated its comparable, the Logitech MX Performance mouse, lasts up to 30 days on a single charge. Why the HUGE difference in battery life? Well according to the Logitech support team both mice have the exact same rechargeable battery. So again I ask myself why does the G700 only last 8-10 hours on 1 full charge and the MX Performance lasts 30 days on one charge and they both contain the same battery? What is destroying the battery life on the G700? What drains it so quickly? The Logitech support team had no direct response and made the excuse that because the G700 has more buttons and it's a gaming mouse that it drains the battery faster and this answer was from an assistant manager after I got fed up with the international gentlemen who had to look up every question and was hard to understand. I call BS on that answer I really do. So I decided to go out and do some testing...I went out and purchased the Logitech MX Performance mouse so I could compare the two. I also decided to purchase a pack of eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh to see if truly this G700 really has an awful battery life or I just got a bad battery. In theory I should be able to get roughly 4 more hours of battery life with an extra 800 mAh if this battery truly only has a running battery time of 8-10 hours on a single charge using its stock battery giving me an estimated run time of 12-14 hours. After further testing the Logitech MX Revoltuoin triumphs the G700 in battery life by far using the eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh on both mice. So again the question remains why does the G700 chew and spit out battery life in a matter of hours VS the MX Revolution lasts a full month on a single charge? I did some research and found that gaming mice naturally have a higher polling rate (ping rate) and they just hog battery juice from their internals because they require more power for more precision and less lag time. Plus gaming mice are for the most part are wired, not wireless and there are reasons for that because of the power gaming mice require to function at their best. What does this gibberish polling rate mean? Basically speaking its how many times your G700 talks to your computer. For example if your polling rate is set to 1000Hz then your G700 is updated every 1 millisecond. That means your G700 and your computer talk 1000 times per second. That's a lot of talking which means a heavy load on your battery. However if you change it to the lowest setting for the G700 which is 125Hz then your G700 only updates every 8 milliseconds which is 125 times per second which is a lot less talking which means less battery consumption. What does this all mean to the average user? Well if your not a hardcore gamer where every millisecond counts on your life then your in luck and should be able to get up to a couple days of battery life on a single charge depending on your average usage. Please note the below instructions are for getting the longest battery life out of your G700 and may not be up to snuff with your gaming needs. Here is how to do it...1. When your G700 is NOT in use toggle the On/Off switch underneath it to ""OFF."" This way your G700 is not always trying to ping your computer even if it is not being used.2. Install the Logitech Gaming Software for your G700 from the Logitech website and set some settings. Set the polling rate to 125Hz. This is the best setting for using less battery juice. Also set the ""Advanced"" settings to ""Power Save"" which will put your mouse to sleep quicker when idle resulting in less consumption of battery juice in case you forgot to toggle your On/Off switch.3. Get a better mAh battery. Logitech threw in a common 1,900 mAh battery which is normal but stupid on their part since the gaming mouse beats it's battery to a pulp. Go out and upgrade your battery to a 2,700 mAh battery. For those who don't know mAh is basically the capacity of your battery. In most cases the higher the mAh the more capacity on name brands minus some fine fine details. However If you go and buy a higher mAh with Chinese writing all over it on some shady website chances are it's a cheap imitation and like all cheap imitations they are...well cheap and expect them to work half as good or less than a name brand.Because of the below average support from the Logitech support team as well as the lesser capacity battery included where a higher capacity battery was obviously needed I took away 2 stars. I would of taken 3 stars off if I had paid the full retail price but I was able to price match Amazon.com at my local retail store and got it to a more reasonable and comfortable price. I hope my review educated you and most importantly helped you achieve greater battery life then you ever thought possible on your Logitech G700 Gaming Mouse. Thanks for reading!

They've always done well for me, despite not being a top of the line headset. I've used them for music, movies, video chatting, and in game communication. They broke last week.I was tempted to simply order a new pair, but These Plantronics caught my eye. I decided to give it a shot. Here are some impressions.The Fit:They're a bit wider than I'm used to with a slightly tighter hold on the head than I'm used to. Not uncomfortable, just...noticeable. I'm confident this will fade with use. The gap inside the ear cup is roomy, and the circumaural padding is soft and comfortable. It seems to be covered in a microfiber of sorts which is pleasing to the touch, but do trap some more heat than may be comfortable. (I recommend removing these every hour or so, just to let your ears breathe a bit.) They headset can expand to accommodate what I can only imagine to be heads of cartoonish proportions, so sizing should not be an issue at all. The mic slides out and can bend a bit for suitable placement.The Look:Aesthetically, they're damn cool. Matte black with a translucent red color scheme, the hideaway mic...it looks good, undeniably so. The square cups give it a vaguely futuristic look, which may be a plus for some. Frankly, it makes little difference to me, but there it is anyway.The Sound:The bass is a bit flat at first listen, but not to a point where it makes a listening experience any less enjoyable. It handles voice very well, on both counts. People sound fine on say, skype or world of warcraft, and your voice is equally audible to people on the receiving end.The Build:The headset seems well made, from top to bottom. The cushions seem fairly durable, the plastic does not bend or stress in any way, the mic boom seems well built and the cord is fairly resilient. The in-line volume control and mute switch also seem to be well made, although the volume control seems a bit...unbalanced. (The volume change from 1 to 2 is much greater than the volume change from 2-3 or 3-4. Volume setting 2 seems to be more than adequate, at any rate.

It is easily legible even in bright light.Audio - They are clear and crisp with the ability to adjust the volume.Audio Directions - The audible directions are the best feature! I caught myself laughing, because the directions are clear and concise: ""Turn left in point 2 miles on to Oak St."" And then when you are literally arriving at that intersection, you'll hear, ""Turn left on Oak St."" How more precise can you get?

The speakers on these devices are just horrible and sometimes, I don't want to have headphones on. I wanted a nice sounding small unit that would allow me to enjoy music anywhere from just about any device.The JAMBOX is small, easy to use, sounds very good for background music, is an excellent design and even runs on batteries.SIZE: this thing is very small, you can take it anywhere and tuck it away in a place where it almost disappears. All you get is music.DESIGN: These folks included a simple interface that uses only four buttons and voice feedback to tell you how to pair a device, charging status and much more. It comes with a manual, but honestly, you can set this up with no trouble out of the box. It is well constructed with a nice feel. It even looks good.BLUETOOTH CALLING: The bluetooth implementation works for sound and as a speakerphone. I was not purchasing this as a speakerphone but WOW, this things is great for conferencing as long as everyone is in front of it. Yes it has an integrated microphone. Rejection is very good, we could all clearly hear the caller and they could hear us as well.SOUND: The sound is actually very good for background music. You won't get big stereo sound field, excellent imaging, thumping bass or dance party volume levels -- but what you do get is actually quite impressive. The sound is balanced from top to bottom and is actually very natural. Acoustic music with vocals like James Taylor, Nora Jones or Shane Jackman are reproduced with excellent balance and clarity. Electronic pop music can lack the dynamics and extended bass, but the bass you do get is not boomy and sounds very natural.

If you are worried the JAMBOX will not play loud, it will, just not THUMPING loud. Because of the smooth high end and good tonal response, you can listen to this thing for a long time with almost no fatigue.BLUETOOTH MUSIC: As most devices, the BlueTooth audio is not as good as if you use the 1/8 audio jack. If you want the best sound plug your phone or computer into this thing. It will amaze you. You may need to turn your headphone output down some so as not to overdrive the unit. It will get a little distorted. The BlueTooth sound is very good, just not as good as when using the plug. Jawbone does something very interesting with the BlueTooth audio. Some devices with BlueTooth audio can be overdriven with the audio output from the source and will distort in at the higher levels. I play guitar and some distortion is good, but not on prerecorded music. NO! The folks at JamBox know then and use something called compression to dynamically limit the amount of sound from your device to the JAMBOX when your BlueTooth level is to high. This compression can sound like 70's pop radio where all the dynamics form the music are taken out. if this bothers you, turn your device (phone/iPod/computer) BlueTooth volume down until the compression is eliminated then use the volume on the JAMBOX to adjust the sound. BUGE IMPROVEMENT.In summary, of the BT Speakers out, this one is the best value for me. Smaller than the Bose, sounds about as good, super easy to use and has MUCH better sound than the sub $100 solutions. If Steve Jobs were to design a BlueTooth portable music device, it would look like the JAMBOX. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3716, 3730)"
B00007E7JU,electronics,What is the body of the device?,"My daughter's friend is a professional photographer doing weddings, portraits, etc and when she got started she told a friend she was going to have to get a better camera that the photos weren't as good as she thought she should get.  She has a Canon EOS Rebel XS and they explained it wasn't the camera but the lens and suggested the EF 50mmf/1.8II.  She loved it and uses it on most shots.  So when I was looking for another lens I checked this lens out and read many reviews and decided to go ahead and purchase this one ""last""(LOL)lens.  I got it before we went to visit family at Christmas and couldn't be more pleased. The shots were clear and sharp and if I had had time to practice more I am sure the shots would have been even better.  I am a novice and do not ever plan to be a professional but just want to do some really nice shots for me.  I use point and shoots just for fun but my iphone does just about as good and use my canon for those nice set up shots or nature shots.I read many reviews and agreed with most of them.  The lens is light but not cheap feeling to me and is my most used lens.  I use my big telephoto zoom lens for nature shots as we live in Colorado and the shots are amazing if you wait for them.  I have the 18-55mm that came with the bundle I bought with the camera but don't use it much.  I had friends try the lens on my camera during the holiday and they all love it as well and they all have other DSLR cameras too.If you want sharp good photos then this is the lens.  I keep it on my camera almost all the time and since it is so light I use my DSLR more than ever.  The bigger lenses are heavy for me to use constantly due to my RA but this smaller lens is just right.It arrived on time and in excellent condition.  Love it, love it, love it.

B00FFJ0HUE,electronics,How much is the amount of sony?,"The ASUS Transformer Book T100 delivers a ton of value in a mostly compelling package. The beauty of today's computing devices is that consumers are no longer forced to buy one-size-fits-all, and instead, have the choice to buy what best fits their needs. I've used the ASUS T100 (64GB) over the past couple of days, and while I wouldn't consider it powerful/comfortable enough as primary computing device, I think it makes great sense as a secondary machine, especially with the advances in cloud storage.From my perspective, the ASUS T100 is basically a tablet with the ability to become a mini-notebook. Whether you will love or hate it strongly depends on what your intended application and expectations are. I plan to use the ASUS T100 for both work and recreation, with note-taking, email, web browsing, presenting, and video playback being the most common tasks, and from my initial impression, it does these jobs quite well. While I found the keyboard a bit too cramped for my liking (smaller-than-normal keys + tighter spacing + my big hands = not very happy), and wasn't too keen on the touch/clickpad (doesn't always respond to the first touch, two-finger scrolling can be a bit jerky, loud and hollow-sounding click), it wasn't a deal-breaker considering the price point. The keyboard dock is really usable, and I appreciated having it when I was typing longer emails and editing office documents.The ASUS T100 features a Intel Atom Z3740 Quad-Core processor which is exceptionally power efficient and much better performing than previous Atoms, though it is still slow compared to traditional notebook/ultrabook processors. For example, the year-old ""low-end"" Pentium 2117U, rated at 17W TDP, is more than twice as fast as the Atom Z3470 in single-threaded workloads though it can also draw ~4X more power. The Z3740 is pretty even with the Pentium in multi-threaded workloads, through the slower single-threaded performance will be more evident with slower app/program launches, etc.At the end of the day, I like the ASUS T100. ASUS has developed many 2-in-1 transforming solutions in the past and its expertise shows in the T100 ~ while made of the plastic, the overall build quality and precision is good for the price. I more or less agree with the specifications such as as the CPU and 64GB of eMMC, though I think 2GB of RAM is too stingy, especially since it cannot be upgraded later. Overall, I think the ASUS Transformer Book T100 is a much needed breath of fresh air and I'm excited about the future possibilities.Notes:1) Compared to the ARM versions of Microsoft's Surface RT and upcoming Surface 2 (non-pro), the ASUS T100 offers an exceptional value proposition by bundling Office 2013 and being compatible with regular Windows software.2) For my own computing needs, I found the combination of a portable machine with good battery life, paired with a powerful desktop to be ideal. The ""good-enough"" performance of the ASUS T100 along with great battery life and ability to fall back to full-blown Windows makes it well suited for this role.3) Web Browsing and Document editing on Microsoft platforms is generally a great experience. Internet Explorer on both Modern and Desktop modes is fully functional and delivers a rich web experience with Flash, Javascript, HTML5, etc. Office 2013 allows for native viewing and editing of documents which is something iOS and Android sometimes have difficulty with.4) Office 2013 Home and Student is pre-installed and includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and One Note. A serial number for activation is in the box.5) The charging cable is Micro USB but is very short by laptop standards. It attaches to the tablet side instead of the keyboard dock. The USB port on the keyboard dock is on the LEFT side.6) The Windows 8.1 UI feels very fluid though App/Program launches can be sluggish.7) Free space on the 64GB version is ~ 37GB. Windows 8 has a built-in recovery mechanism which allows you to re-install/repair Windows or remove all user files.8) The T100 supports Microsoft's Connected Standby feature which means it only sips power in the suspend state so you don't need to turn it on/off frequently. Modern Apps such as email are refreshed periodically even in suspend so the live tiles are ""fresh"" when you resume the system. Resume from suspend is nearly instantaneous. It should be noted that desktop apps are suspended during Connected Standby so they are not refreshed.9) Boot times are quick ~ the system can boot to the start screen in &lt;10 seconds.10) A full-sized USB port on the tablet would have been highly appreciated...Hopefully a future version will have multiple USB ports!11) Slightly Annoying: The Windows button on the front/bottom of the tablet doesn't do anything! The only way to get back to the Start screen from the desktop is either to hit the Start Button or use the charms.12) Battery life is really quite good. I haven't run it down from 100% to zero but 8 hours of light use is very doable. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4991, 5005)"

Still no go. Then I used another cable I had bought from the same vendor almost a year earlier, and the problem stopped. You could feel the difference in the tighness of the connectors of the last cable I tried.All three cables were from eForcity.  Don't know what to say about that except, buy more than 1 and preferably from different vendors. I think charging $20-$40 is criminal, but I would pay $10 for a known to be decent cable.  I think eForcity would eventually make it right, but a person would be more likely to think it's the hardware malfunctioning since the cable still works to some degree. That's what the 1.3b rating is about. Unfortunately there are no easy ways to tell if a cable is good other than to swap it out unless you have the proper measuring and testing equipment.Update 07/06/09--eForcity must be complimented for their customer service.  I received two replacement cables shortly after notifying them.They worked but I stuck with the original cable I had bought from them a year ago. As I stated before, apparently a cable can work for awhile and then fail partially due to the high data transfer rates. The replacement cables are working okay on another less sophisticated system.Great pricing, but you take a chance here. Also, the ad states HDMI 1.3b specs, but the packaging only says 1.3, which is not the same spec!I would upgrade eForcity's star rating just based on their customer service and the original cable I have from them but it can't be changed at this point.

B005CT56F8,electronics,What is a quick and accurate review?,"In the last year I've purchased eight Seagate 2 TB consumer grade retail internal drives as external RAID 5 storage.  My initial experience with the drives were good. They performed well and were quiet. However, within 9 months I had two failures. Both failures were immediate and showed no error conditions prior to their failure. Due to the RAID 5 configuration, I didn't experience data loss. Seagate replaced both drives without question, although I still had to cover shipping to send the failed drives to Seagate.Before my 2 TB drive failures, I purchased a Seagate 3 TB drive as part of an upgrade OWC did on my iMac. From the day the drive was installed, I had problems with OS and application stability. Within 9 months, the 3 TB Seagate drive had failed. I asked that OWC replace the failed Seagate drive with a Hitachi 2 TB drive. The iMac has been stable ever since.My conclusion from just my experience, is that Seagate drives have an unusually high failure rate when compared to the same number of Hitachi drives I've deployed. Seagate replaces failed drives without any pushback, but I'm uncomfortable placing critical data on the replacement drives. I end up deploying them into non-critical transient storage or as part of a layered backup strategy. To date, all of the replacement drives Seagate has sent me are performing well.Update: Two months after Seagate sent me a replacement for the 3 TB drive, the replacement has failed. The replacement drive is flagged as being out of warranty, even though the drive is only two months old. I don't expect that I will buy another Seagate product again.

B003LR7ME6,electronics,How do you like the texture?,"I bought this case to protect my iPad 3. Overall, it appears to be a good case, though I have a number of quibbles with it. I have had the case only a few days, so these are initial impressions.Good stuff: The case fits the iPad 3 very well. It is a bit snug, perhaps; I have seen some reviewers complain about this, but I consider it to be an advantage. The auto-on-off switch, activated by a magnet when the case is closed, works just fine. My primary concern was that the case would hold the iPad securely, without slipping, especially when being used as a stand in the upright position. The case I bought for my original iPad failed in this regard. The new case, however, uses a velcro closure that feels very secure. It does not slide around in the case at all.Neutral stuff: The buttons on the side of the unit are not easy to reach, but that is more a function of the design of the iPad rather than the case. Exposing the buttons would require exposing more of the iPad, which would not be a good design decision (IMO). Be advised that while the product literature suggests that this case is made of leather, it isn't. I knew that when I purchased it, so that wasn't an issue for me. However, if anyone is led to believe that this is a leather case, be assured: it isn't. The case features a hand strap on the back of the flap, for use when the flap is folded around. I have not found a good way to use this flap, so I consider it a neutral feature. (YMMV) Finally, I have not used the stylus loop, and I don't plan to, so I have nothing to say in that regard (except that it successfully stays out of the way if you don't care to use it).Bad stuff: This case is heavy. I was surprised at how heavy it is. With the case, it gives up any gains in weight that it had over the original iPad; in fact, I believe the iPad 3 with this case weighs more than my iPad 1 in its case. This is only an issue when I am supporting the iPad in my hands, but it is noticeable at those times--and annoying. Also, this case smells. It has a chemical, fake-leather smell that is unpleasant and sticks to your hands. I expect that the smell will fade over time (I have used fake leather steering wheel covers in my car, and they have the same problem), but for now, it's yet another annoyance. Finally--and this is little more than a quibble--the angles at which the iPad sits when the case is used as a stand are not quite to my liking. The angle in the upright position is too steep, and the angle in the leaned-back position is too shallow.Summary: I gave this case four stars, and I would recommend it to a friend. Of course, I would inform him of the disadvantages that I have noted in the review. However, they do not outweigh the advantages of the case (again, IMO).

So using those I've always used a ""claw/finger"" grip and lift the mouse with my fingers.  This mouse is GREAT for that!  The ""small"" cover/grip is nice and flat on the sides with a small footprint.  99% of the other gaming mice out there have a huge palm-grip design with all these crazy grooves for your thumb, long enough to rest your whole hand on, etc.  If that's the kind of mouse you like, then this might not be for you as even the ""large"" cover/grip is really only slightly larger than the ""small"" grip.  It's a little more contoured, but isn't gigantic where you're gonna rest your hand on it.Great feature is you can set 5 different sensitivity points on it in 200 intervals from 200-3200.  Any 5 you want!  Easy to change and play around with.Only negative I have so far is the weights.  Like I said, using the ""claw"" grip one picks up the mouse from time to time with the thumb and pinky/ring fingers.  Well the weights are in the back/rear side of the mouse, so when I pick up the mouse it tilts/pivots back a little which DOES move the cursor initially.  Used to the 50/50 weight distribution and possibly mice not SO sensitive!  Maybe I need to play with the weights a lil more, play with my grip, or just remove them entirely (which is a shame as it takes that feature of the mouse away).

A metal stand is included which is cleverlydesigned to fold out, even with the hand strap in place.The hand strap looks good but I'm not sure how much I will use it. I'mused to holding the ipad with one or two hands along the edges.Fortunately, you can adjust the strap length or remove it as necessary. Thestand rotates with the hand strap so you can set it up in any orientation.I found the case to be easy to install and it fits precisely around theipad. This case is designed to cover all the ports so you will need to foldthe covers up to access the ports underneath. Folding these covers out ofthe way is an extra step that takes some getting used to. If you arelooking to provide protection for these ports, the solution works well andlooks good.This is a 3 piece cover designed to protect the whole ipad but not add toomuch bulk. The case is surprisingly light but still provides goodprotection. The inner case is rigid and provides an integral screen guardand a full coverage frame for the outer cover. The outer cover is softerand has flexible covers for the earphone, charger, and mute buttons. Thespeakers and microphone have clear passage ways for good sound performance. Onevery nice feature is that the case does not stick up very much beyond thescreen, this makes it easy and comfortable to hold. The extra width of thecase gives you a place for your thumb and prevents you from triggering thescreen. This is very convenient when holding the screen in landscape modeA few minor concerns: 1) The screen cover is integral to the case so itdoesn't appear to be individually replaceable. 2) there is no Smart Coverfunction to turn off the screen.Overall, a very nice case that serves to fully cover the ipad-mini and yet notinterfere with it's function.

B000Q8UAWY,electronics,What is a quick and accurate review?,"I got this mini hub as a freebie at a trade show and I am using it occasionally, while on the road - I preemptively plug in the thumb drives that I need and then I attach the entire assembly to whatever machine I may be using when I need them. It's been okay so far.Any prospective buyer should be aware of the following before making the purchase:- Definitely meant for travel and laptops, less suitable on one's desk or desktop machines (see below).- The cord is VERY short. This is an issue with desktops. I suppose it's possible to plug the hub in and leave it hanging off the front or the back of a desktop computer but it's not something that I would do.- Related to the above, it is not a fashion statement. The hub is functional and allows 4 USB devices to be plugged into it but it is not likely to win any design award. I mention this because, with the chord being as short as it is, the likely space this hub will occupy is on your desk.- It is not powered. As such, do not plan to use it with (more than one) USB-powered hard drives. It should be okay if the drives use their own power supply.- It does not have many blinking lights like some other hubs do. I like that.Overall, the Ultra Mini Hub is a useful device and it should be an excellent buy to the extent that the buyer is aware of the issues I listed above. It is specifically designed for occasional use while traveling. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1395, 1409)"

B002MAPRYU,electronics,Where do I place the button on the measurement pattern?,"I've known people to have problems with the 4GB model, but my 2GB works just fine even after 2 years of regular use. I don't load any songs onto the player itself. Instead I use a 16GB MicroSD card which transfers music much faster and stores much more. I don't have anywhere near 16GB of music, but it's nice to have the option for expandable storage rather than be stuck with however many gigs Apple allows you. Transferring music works just like transferring files to and from a flash drive (because it basically is, especially if you use a MicroSD card). Pull up your music library folder and your storage folder and transfer as necessary. Easy as pie. There will be no doubt as to which songs are on your device.This player is quite small but never uncomfortable to use. The screen is bright enough to be clearly visible in sunlight and the colors contrast so that the text stands out. The buttons are solid and have been quite durable. I greatly prefer having a solid directional pad than a touch circle or touch screen. Separate power and volume buttons seal the deal for great controls. The interface is clean and simple, giving you easy access to sorting music by artist, album, or song, as well as a radio and audio books for those who are interested.I only have two problems with the player that I easily get around. It does not read MP4s, so I use a free M4a to MP3 Converter that I got from CNET.com. And because the player sorts by artist or album, not both at the same time, you'll end up with albums spread across multiple artists. For example, I have an Eric Clapton collection that spans his whole career. The album includes songs from Cream, Blind Faith, Derek and the Dominoes, and songs featuring BB King or J.J. Cale. Each one is labeled as a new artist separate from Eric Clapton, so to listen to their songs I have to go to the artist rather than have the whole album filed under Clapton. Minor complaint but Zune did it and I liked that.Easily the best player I have owned. If mine ever dies, I would buy a new one of the same model immediately.

The 'cast is also an open platform so they say the final word is far from being said here, and there's a lot more to come.There is no remote or some on screen interface. The device is controlled via mobile devices or pc/laptop using the chromecast mobile app. I have the app on my iphone and Nexus 7 (android). Integration with the devices is OK but can be improved in terms of interface however playback for Netflix and Google Play was flawless for me.Setup is super easy and simple. You basically don't need to type in almost any information other than naming you device (optional but useful if you have more than one). Just plug it in, and let the app on you phone/device set up itself. Note however that the chromcast turns off when not in use so you have to turn on your tv and switch to the chromecast to wake it up so you can set it up (say on another device).I hope this device will support other apps in the future, like Amazon for example.

The main question you should ask yourself is do you shop or buy from amazon. If the answer is yes, buy it. If you don't, then buy something else. It's pretty much as easy as that. I don't understand all these people that buy the Fire HD to ""try it out"" and complain that it takes the Fire 4.5888888 seconds longer to load a screen than the nexus or ipad. Can you really not wait a total of 5 extra seconds for a device to load a page? I think if that is a deal breaker for you, perhaps you have bigger problems at hand. There is really nothing that I found that I can complain about with this tablet, I'm owned several kindles over the years and I loved the 1st fire which i recently sold once I ordered this one. Many people have already stated the improvements and I agree 100% with what other reviewers have said. This is my first Kindle also with the ""Ads"" on the device and I must say, it's not nearly as annoying as I had thought it was going to be. I also like the whole ""customers have also bought"" section on the home screen as it gives you other items that you may like. My book wish list is quickly filling up thanks to that tricky little feature. As others have said, the screen is amazing. Watching a film in HD, hell I think the picture is better than my 3 year old Toshiba HDTV. The built in speakers do sound better than any other speakers on any device I have heard, however I still mostly use headphones while watching movies or videos on it. Again, its a great device, there is nothing I can complain about here. The fact that for under $300 I have a HD tablet with case and charger is pretty much amazing.

Instead, the buttons are made of cheap plastic and have the feel of a a $29.00 organizer you might buy at Walgreens. The keys on the remote and the remote itself are slippery and the ergonomics of holding the remote appear to fit the hands of a species not of this earth. It is much easier to press the buttons on my Sony or Tivo.Its also very easy to press the wrong item on the LCD as the choices on the LCD are very close together.The main thing this unit is good for (when it works) is turning multiple components on or off in sequence. Because the remote is clumsy to manipulate, turning the components all one as programmed often doesn't work. There isn't much tolerance for not aiming it at the sweet spot of your components which you have to determine by trial and error.The macros are nice, but the unit is slower than the native remote, ie the Tivo so it somewhat offsets using the macros. Once I turn on my components I now just start using the Tivo remote until I am ready to turn all my components off.Essentially, for me this is a $200.00 device to turn my components on or off.

B003ELYQGG,electronics,How is the bass?,"These earbuds are nothing special. Their best attribute is that they are cheap. The sound from them is nothing special. In comparison to my standard white IPod buds these seem to emphasize the higher frequencies. There seems to be nothing happening in the bass range with these. I don't think they are efficient enough to have much bass at all. To be fair, my IPod buds overly emphasize bass so they are not that accurate either. I also compared these to a pricy Sennheiser set that I've owned for a couple of years and let's just say there is a reason why the Sennheisers cost more.Surely these Panasonic buds are very nice to use if you think they might get damaged somehow in use as it will not break your heart to have to replace them. These might be especially useful if you only listen to talk radio or have high frequency hearing loss. If you really like to listen to the most of your music and you must wear earbuds then these are not for you.I also have to note that these are packaged in a difficult to open blister pack that required several passes with utility shears to break into. I hate to see all the plastic that has to be discarded just to get this product out of the package.Cosmetically, they are OK. They don't hurt my ears and are comfortable to me. They come with a couple of other size ear pieces if you are hard to fit. The wires take a set when folded so they are not very well-behaved and don't coil nicely and lie flat when you put them away.

B000R5LWRI,electronics,What is the quality of the product?,"I am upgrading our house network to increase transfer speeds between all our devices and to implement a more robust backup scheme.  Chose the ASUS Black Knight N66U router as our primary networking device, a dual band 450 Mbps device, which then led to the need for higher speed wireless adapters on a few key computers to take advantage of the higher router speeds, and after much research, chose the TRENDnet 450's to match the router specs.  Have installed these on work laptop and audio workstation desktop so far, and will purchase another for home server when get that up and running.Honestly, I've been moving away from the old stalwarts like Netgear, Dlink, and especially LinkSys (after Cisco acquisition), as I don't think they are on the leading edge of performance, reliability, and ease of use any more.  TRENDnet, on the other hand, seems to be on the rise, and offering good price/performance, especially on the adapter side.  Had a TRENDnet 300 Mbps 2.4GHz dongle that worked very well, so that and reviews led me to the 684UB.Conclusion, the TRENDnet 684UB is an very good low priced choice!  However, for MAXIMUM throughput, get the slightly more expensive but worth it Asus USB-N66ASUS Dual-Band Wireless-N900 USB Network Adapter (USB-N66)First and foremost, am getting much higher link speeds than via old N and G adapters linked to my previous dual band N router (Netgear WNDR3700 dual band 300Mbps).  Am seeing up to the rated 450 Mbps link speed with the TRENDnet 684UB working with the Asus Black Knight, especially on 5GHz band, and had never exceeded 100 Mbps with previous setup.  2.4 GHz link speeds are up as well, 50-100%, despite the crowding in that band in general and where I live specifically.  I know link speeds are not the same as throughput, BUT, throughput is some *fraction* of link speed, so, if you don't get the higher link speed, you are limiting throughput as well, and now, I can work with the maximum *potential* speed that 802.11N currently provides.  Have not done formal speed/throughput benchmarking, but will update this review if I do.  Real world speed FEELS fast, and much faster than previous setup.Second, these adapters are really small!  No, they are not a USB dongle in size, but I want speed first and foremost for this application, and the device just needs some physical size for antennas to send and receive at these new higher 802.11N speeds.Setup was drop dead easy, just downloaded the latest driver and utility bundle from the TRENDnet site (I almost never use included CDs with devices, as the drivers are almost always out of date), installed, plugged in, and connected to my router with WPA2-PSK security (this specific security protocol is necessary to get to the top speeds in the 802.11N spec).Another cool thing I am testing is on my laptop, where I have both the built-in dual band 300 Mbps Intel radio and now the TRENDnet both operating simultaneously.  Have not done any benchmarks yet that would measure the benefits of such a setup, but I'm intrigued.  And it's just plain cool to have 2.4 and 5 GHz connections show up simultaneously in Windows wifi taskbar app.Summing up...Pros+ True 450 Mbps link speeds on 5GHz band in real world (router two rooms away thru three walls)+ Very small size - 3"" tall by 2"" wide+ Can locate device for optimum reception via USB cable+ GREAT price+ Easy setup, can be managed by Windows or through optional utility software+ Looks like a high tech shark fin :-)Cons- Throughput drops under load, as noted by others elsewhere (- 1 star).- Utility software is kind of primitive, but seems to work fine.  I did notice at one point that I had to enter my SSID password in both the TRENDnet utility and Windows Wireless Networking for things to work right, but kinda serves me right for leaving both enabled - heh hehTips* Location/orientation.  Move the adapter around, changing orientation, height, location, to get the best signal, and watch the link speed change to see which location provides best link speed.  I just held the adapter in many different positions for a few seconds and eyeballed the average link speed to find out what was best.  Turned out location/orientation within the range of the bundled USB cable could affect speed by  as much as 50%!  For me, higher was better (perhaps obviously), and the best orientation was sideways hanging off the edge of my 26"" LCD, with the lights facing down.  Hmmm... but it works.* Tune your router.  The router is of course the other key enabler of overall network performance.  Each router is different, but on the Asus Dark Knight I'm using the already mentioned WPA2-PSK security on both bands, 40MHz channel width on 5GHz band, and 20/40 Auto on the 2.4 GHz band, and, critically, power output turned up to the 200 mW maximum.  The latter REALLY helps both bands, but especially the 5GHz link speeds.Highly recommend the 684UB for those who have dual band 450 Mbps routers and need a high performance, reasonably priced adapter to match.

I might have appreciated a rubberized feel to the sides of this mouse rather than the textured hard plastic, but it's just as effective.This mouse lost a star due to a couple annoyances I have.First off, this does not use the Logitech universal receiver that the company uses for other wireless keyboards/mice. It's receiver polls at a much higher frequency. This paired with the fact that the mouse runs off of one AA NiMH battery, means the battery life is pretty abysmal; few hours at most. They've cleverly designed the charging cable to turn the mouse into a cabled variant which is convenient, but I now find myself almost exclusively using the mouse in this way rather than via wireless which defeats the purpose.Secondly, I lift my mouse off the mat while using it quite often. It's a habit I've had for 15 years or so. When I do that with this mouse, I almost always push one or two of the bottom thumb buttons. It's been enough of a problem that I've had to manually set these buttons to do nothing in games and the Logitech software (it would affect the DPI of the mouse).

The 26 was fine but the 32 main board had a blown resistor as well. Samsung will only fix the capacitors and not anything that may happen to the LCD due to cascade failure! Anyhow the price to fix the 32 was close to $300! So for a bit more we bought the 40 with Smart TV.We had tried the better Samsung 40 LED with 3D and faster processor in the past but found the picture with the faster processing to be fake looking and would turn that feature off. The 3D worked but we felt it would be best for a larger TV and will consider it when we replace our Pioneer Elite 60 Plasma. Hopefully not for a long time Just Love that TV and wish Pioneer had stayed in the game.As many reviewers have stated; and it is the case with most slim LEC/LED's with the speakers in the back; the sound can be low at times. We have adjusted the settings for clear voice. It seems that conversation is the first to be effected and the sound can be too low to hear. We always have the remote in the ready to turn the volume up and rewind to hear what we missed. Sure you could turn the volume up; and we have; but it becomes too loud.It took a bit but I finally got the screen / color settings to our liking. Our set had a push to the red side and flesh tone was off most of the time. Even now it will shift from time to time. One second the flesh tone will seem fine and the next it looks like everyone has a tan or slight sun burn. Not sure if this is due to the background colors present. Another item is the off screen angle doesn't seem to be as good as the higher level sets. Colors and settings are a personal choice and some might light the all the settings on and the picture really bright. I prefer the subtle approach and will turn most settings down. If you turn on the Black enhancement features to full you will crush you your shadows and details. I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed. Also this is a 60Hz set with 1080p. Don't let the 60Hz scare you or be fooled into needed the 240Hz. The picture is great and as stated before we found the higher speed sets to look fake. Almost like watching a live play.The Smart TV works great for us. We have it connected via a hard connection and are not using the wireless. Having the wireless is a Great feature but a hard connection is always best if you can. The update has added Amazon Prime to the menu which is something we were looking for.

Amazon Prime has quit a bit of children programing and my son loves Thomas the Train.The remote has all the functions you will need and lights up! It also controls our PS3 if we watch a Blu Ray!The downside. This TV doesn't have a swivel stand! Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set. Also with the weaker off angle on this set it is needed to direct to the screen to the viewing area. This is mainly need for us because we have the TV in the corner. If you had the set straight it would be fine. We bought this TV Swivel at Amazon that works great -B009UDTUNGA minor but weak area is the cable retainer. It does not stick to the stand! The stand has a small area that is not flat to attach the retainer to but the double sided tape to hold the cable retainer to the set keeps falling off.

If you look in the product photos,you'll see the iPad part connects on a swivel through what is essentially a camera lens cap.  That part is ok and secure,except the camera lens cap part is on a very loose hinge itself.  The main hinge, however, is very stiff.  So, you have to use a fair amount of force to open the case.  Once you get it about 30 degrees or so open, you have to switch your grip.  If you don't, the weak camera lens cap hinge comes into play,and all the force you were putting on the stiff main hinge moves to the no resistance camera lens cap hinge.  More than a few times it would suddenly flip open on me, causing me to nearly drop my iPad.  Not cool.  I also started to experience some other issues, like the keyboard was doubling some letters--like the letter &#34;E&#34;. Talk about the worst letter to double every 4/5 times you type it...Another issue is adjusting the view angle.  The iPad holder part has a ratcheting mechanism that locks the screen at a set distance from the keyboard.  Problem is, it ratchets going out.  Which means any time you what to adjust the angle, the ratchet part offers no resistance and the screen just slides right over the top of the keyboard.  Any adjustments become two handed, one to mess with the stiff hinge and screen angle, the other to make sure the screen stays at the right distance from the keyboard.Finally, the charge light went on and stayed on.  To me, this was indicative of some serious quality issues, and I wasn't going to hang around and see what failed next. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1670, 1684)"

B00426C57O,electronics,How was your experience?,"I brought this for my mother because it will be simple for her to use. I especially liked the simple remote control which is not overwhelming. However the wireless connectivity was a little difficult and very finicky. The wireless router is located about 20 feet away, and we've never had any problem conencting with laptops or iPhones/iPods. However, I had to fidget with the placement of the Roku and attempted 2-3x before connecting finally. It then downloaded an update and after it rebooted, it lost the wireless connection again. So I fidgeted with the placement again until it connected. Then I tried to setup NetFlix and the wireless had dropped again, so I reconnected, got the activitation code and it validated the Roku box. Thankfully, you cannot turn the Roku off so hopefully once it's connected, it stays connected or tries to reconnect. I am hoping it was just the initial setup that was slightly flakey. To be on the safe side, I made sure the wireless router and the Roku had as few electronic obstacles around it. I am very impressed with the streaming technology and how the Roku is able to buffer the streaming so the movie is shown smoothly and crisply. It does look so much better than watching NetFlix on the PC or Wii. I also have Netflix on the PS3 and Xbox360 and I find the quality comparable. Another great feature is that the audio is turned on for BOTH HDMI and left/right audio cables so you can run the sound to the receiver and TV. Unfortunately, I ran out of optical inputs on the receiver but I'm assuming that toslink connection is always on as well. I have high hopes that my mother will be able to use the Roku, and once Netflix starts providing closed-captioning on the Roku, it will be even more useful! I am just concerned about the wireless connectivity but if it does prove to be a problem, my solution would be to run ethernet straight to the Roku or wire the electrical outlets with Netgear PowerLine equipment (they seem to provide very good results).

B003LR7ME6,electronics,How is the current protection?,"Having bought the new Ipad, of course I want a protective case. I prefer one that covers the back also, not just the front and can be a good stand. I found a number of cases with a consensus of excellent reviews. I chose this one because I like the way it uses a tab to create the triangle, some other just have the ipad sit in a notch. It also has a handle to support it with one hand.Having used the product for over a month I am very happy with it. All the buttons are accessible through the cutouts. One thing to do is make sure the flap that holds the ipad in on the edge with the full slot is velcroed tightly so it can't slip at all. The stand works well - I even just use the ipad in bed, sitting it right on my chest. The magnet system to sleep/wake the unit when the cover is opened or closed works perfectly. My only concern is that I see a slight tear at one of the hinges.  I don't think it will develop into a problem, so I give it 5 stars - obviously if it does not last my opinion will change. (The product doesn't seem to have any additional warranty.)Some buyers mentioned an odor issue when they first unpacked it. I did not have that problem.Since the ipad and case are black, and the ipad works in any orientation it can take a bit of feeling to find the on-off button...I may stick a little colored sticker to make it obvious.

B002HWRJBM,electronics,How is the connection?,"UPDATE Sept 15:  My original review was mainly positive but knocked off a star for some minor issues.  I got a replacement which fixed one problem but introduces another.  I'll insert comments into my original review.----I agree with almost everything said in the other positive reviews about the great ergonomics, the scroll wheel that you can toggle between hyperscrolling (very useful) and the more common measured/notched scrolling, the many useful features attached to the other buttons, the way you can use the mouse while the battery recharges, and the incredibly tiny receiver that works with other compatible devices.Maybe you're having trouble thinking of a way to justify spending $100 for a rodent.  I was too, but I thought of a way to justify it that maybe a few of you might find helpful:Before now, I'd never spent more than $30 on a mouse (except once, a $50 microsoft bluetooth mouse that doesn't work too well).  But I was never happy with any of them.  They were either uncomfortable after an hour or so of use, or stopped working after a while, or something.  So, after a few months, I'd give up and buy another one.  Over time, I spent probably $200 on a series of cheap mice.When the Performance MX came out a few weeks ago, I saw all the positive reviews (from users and from professional publications and websites), and it occurred to me that maybe if I spent more for a really good mouse, I'd be happy and wouldn't have to keep buying $30 mice every few months.As I said above, in most ways I think this is a great mouse and agree with the many other positive reviews.  But I've experienced some minor issues, too.1.  When you start pushing the mouse around after it's been sitting idle - even for just a few minutes - there's an annoying one- to two-second lag before the cursor reacts.  UPDATE Sept 15:  Logitech tech support figured out that this was a defect.  I got a replacement, and it's perfect.  With Amazon, I didn't have to pay shipping for the replacement, and I didn't have to return the first mouse until after receiving the replacement.  Very happy with Amazon's service.2.  At this time, the number of devices that are compatible with the unifying receiver is very small:  just two keyboards and three mice.  The unifying receiver would be far more valuable if there were more different types of compatible devices.  For example, I would like to see a numeric keypad and also a presentation/pointer that could work with the unifying receiver - logitech makes both such devices now, but they won't work with the unifying receiver.3.  I'm probably being too picky here, but I find the ""click"" to be a bit tinny, and louder and less satisfying than other mice I've used.  UPDATE Sept 15:  the replacement mouse is worse.  The left button makes the same tinny click when you press down, but when you let go it makes a louder sound, almost like a knock on a door.  (The right mouse button doesn't do this.  Go figure.)  This gets annoying after a while.  Sorry, but if I'm paying $100 for a mouse, I want it to be just about perfect.Since almost all the other reviews of this mouse are very positive, I am sure that my experience with two of them each having a minor but annoying defect is uncommon.  In absence of these apparently rare defects, this is a really great mouse. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3313, 3327)"

B000HCT12O,electronics,How was the feature?,"I have owned this mouse for 2 years now and have finally given up on it. It does have amazing features and an amazing grip but it still has flaws that render it useless for some.Reliability:2 years, dropped so many times and still works like the first day I got it. I think it's reliable enough and the finish is great, not a single scratch.Installation:Is straightforward. You can use the Windows built-in drivers (plug and play) and it will work straightaway. However, if you want to use the many features of the mouse you'll have to install Logitech SetPoint.Software:SetPoint is OK. It has it's bugs (in Vista x64 it would sometimes forget your settings on startup and you would need to double click the SetPoint taskbar icon for it to activate - an example is the wheel setting, being click-to-click or middle button). Older versions (I'm at 4.80) had problems in recognizing the mouse in Vista x64, this seems to have been solved from 4.xx.Features:Nevertheless it gives good flexibility in configuring the mouse. Which, in turn, comes with many features of which:- Configurable wheel (free to spin - or normal click-click-click), if you don't want a middle-button you can set it to shift between the two. Or you can even let SetPoint automatically decide based on your scrolling speed.- The wheel itself would act as left/right buttons if you push it to the sides. I never used this feature and as I don't find it easy. It's not very comfortable really.- 2 additional buttons on the side, and one in the middle just behind the wheel - configurable to whatever you like.- A 2nd wheel...ish thing.. It's useful to scroll through open windows.The mouse feels great in the hand and is quite comfortable but it may need to be elevated slightly higher than the normal position comfortable for the keyboard. This of course also depends on how big your hands are, mine are big.Tracking:Is great. Works fine on almost all surfaces I tried it on. You will hardly find a surface that this mouse doesn't track on.Speed:Not the best feature. 800 dpi and response (or refresh) rate is way low. I'm not sure if this is wireless lagging or because of the sensor itself but the mouse is SLOW so forget using it for fast action gaming. Seriously, forget it and go look somewhere else if you want this mouse for gaming. THAT, and add to it how HEAVY the mouse is, it WILL set you back in games.Wireless:Bad. It interferes with 2.4GHz wifi. I changed routers, changed channels, changed all kinds of settings in my wifi network and it still interferes like crazy. Of course this only happens when there is heavy load on the wireless network - like downloads or something. But you would expect better from Logitech. This is not acceptable.Because of speed and the wireless problems I finally gave up on it and purchased a wired habu (microsoft-razer). Yes, it's old but I got it for a good price and honestly I didn't know what I was missing. I didn't want to take another chance with Wireless for now (although another cheapo mouse I have has no issues with wifi whatsoever) and I wanted something lighter and faster (which wireless mice normally lack).

B0099SMFVQ,electronics,What is the easy key?,"This is one of those keyboards that you can immediately tell is top quality. Granted, Logitech has a history of making good keyboards that feel and work well even after years of prolonged use. In fact, despite occasional forays into other brands, I've always come back to them. It's gotten to the point where I'd pretty much consider myself brand-loyal.The downside to their products is they're usually more expensive than the competition. There aren't many choices for bluetooth keyboards with memory- the only other one I found was IOGear's Multi-link keyboard. That one looked technically superior in some respects, e.g. it has a trackpad and 6-device memory. It's also about half the price, and I'll admit I was (again) sorely tempted to jump the brand boat and check it out. However, I decided not to due to the fact that I'd probably use a bluetooth mouse anyway, and I don't plan on using this with any more than 3 devices anyhow. Plus, the Logitech K810 has some advantages of its own- namely that it's backlit, rechargeable, and can actually detect when your hands are on it for power management.The keyboard itself is both compact and slim, and is very attractive. It also feels great typing on it despite the fact that it's a compact keyboard. The keys are very quiet in general and the backlighting works well. It lasts a good amount of time on a charge (usually about 2 weeks if you use the backlight), and is rechargeable via micro USB. The keyboard layout is pretty standard, with 3 F keys serving the dual purpose of switching devices and the others to control various functions like backlight intensity and volume control. You switch to the regular F# functionality via a FN key.Switching devices is the big draw of this keyboard, and it works very well- practically instantaneously. The keyboard seems to have memory, so if you type while switching it will backlog the keystrokes. Pairing was also straightforward- there is a standard pairing button on the bottom, and after pushing it you select which device setting to use, then pair as usual. The keyboard also has a manual power switch if you're going to store it. Overall, it works very well in general.The keyboard does lay flat (and only flat) so in that respect it's very similar to Apple's bluetooth keyboards. The feel of this one is different from Apple's but very nice in general- it's comfortable to type on for long periods of time and doesn't take long to get used to. Build quality appears to be very solid- no clattering if you shake it, and although I wouldn't toss it around the room it does look capable of taking a few drops.I've used quite a few bluetooth keyboards over the years, including older Logitechs, cheap ones by Anker, and Apple's. This is definitely my favorite one so far. The switching function and backlighting make it pretty unique, and I would say it's worth the high price. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2882, 2896)"

B0074WDDN8,electronics,Is this lens have manual focus?,"A little bit of history:I started my foray into DSLRs with theOlympus Evolt E510, simply because I used an OM-10 for years before that. Being new to the DSLR game, the ""philosophy"" of 4/3s seemed very sound to me; high quality lenses that are compact and can be coupled with compact bodies that will put out excellent image quality; of course the added benefit of in-body stabilisation seemed to just make a great sum of parts. I went through a range of 4/3s bodies including theOlympus Evolt E-3and while I was always pleased with the lenses, the image quality always left more to be desired. Also, once I switched to the E-3, the bulk of the system didn't make sense to me as it was pretty similar to full frame and yet lagged in image quality. After 2 years with 4/3s I finally moved on to theNikon D700and have been with it ever since.The caveat of full-frame is obviously the inherent size and weight of the system and I hated being ""the camera guy"" every time I was out with friends or even shooting casually and that's when I started dabbling with micro 4/3s. The initial iterations while exciting, still were slow and not great in terms of IQ, but the E-M5 changed it all. Over the years the system has matured and the E-M5 finally brings a good quality semi-pro body that is small, light, beautiful and most importantly excels in image quality. I use this camera with Panasonic lenses,Panasonic 12-35mm/F2.8,Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0&Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 Leica Lensand this entire system fits neatly in a shoulder bag with 3 batteries.I've been shooting with this system for 3 months now and have found the image quality to be very similar to my D700. I still use my D700 for paid work because I'm used to it, but I don't see why the E-M5 wouldn't work for anyone that wants to use it professionally. Of course, the depth of field differences will always exist, but those are inherent characteristics of the systems and it's up to the user to make the best or worst of it.Overall, the E-M5 finally realises what 4/3s was supposed to be and I recommend this camera very highly for anyone that's either looking to enter into a camera system or wants to supplement a full frame system with something smaller and lighter. But of course, there are a few compromises, but none that should be detrimental to use. I also like the new stabilisation system which has allowed me to get tack sharp shots at up to 1s of exposure! Also, the weather sealed body makes a huge difference too.This camera is a definite winner. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2515, 2529)"
B000HJPK2C,electronics,Is the focus of the binoculars simple and accurate?,"I own and have used the lens for over 3 months now. I have experienced some softness out beyond 200mm while using it on auto-focus, but I am learning to work within the limits of the lens. Given what has been said in some reviews about softness out past 200mm (and my own initial experience) I decided to run some tests for how sharp the pictures could really be. The one caveat I had is that for the tests I ran I used manual focus - I wanted to test the optics not the AF or VR functions since they are not a requirement for using the lens. Also, I am starting to get very interested in Equestrian photography. I need the long zoom and have found that pre-focusing on a point, rather than depending on Auto-focus is much more effective for obtaining the results I am looking for.For my test I used this lens mounted on a D300 to take some pictures of a bell tower. Because I was specifically testing the lens for sharpness past 200mm (I shot several at 300mm) I focused the lens manually, and used a tripod. As it turned out there was chain link fencing over the opening to the bell which I could not see, from where I was standing in a parking lot across the street. That made my test even better.I then took several shots of the bell and the tower, being careful to focus the lens on specific characteristics of the bell. The shots were all sharp. I then downloaded and examined the photos at high magnification on my PC. I did not lose any significant resolution of the chain link (which I could only make out after I downloaded the pictures) or the objects I was focused upon until I viewing the shots at 200% or greater magnification. At that point you could actually begin to see the individual pixels. So I have to say that I do not agree with the reviews about how the lens gives poor results out past 200mm. I have obtained excellent results through the entire zoom range.I will say that the AF-S system for the lens seems to hunt a lot when there are a lot of objects in the field of view (i.e., the leaves on a tree while trying to photograph a bird), so it does sometimes focus on something other that what I want - that could have been what the others were complaining about. But if I assure myself that it is focused on my target and use the AF lock built into the camera that problem goes away. Also if I use the lens on manual focus the problem goes away.I am very happy with the lens and highly recommend it. I believe it is an outstanding value for the price.

B003ELYQGG,electronics,How would you rate the designs for the new house?,"These are some cool little ear buds.  The bud part is oval shaped (after being inserted onto the post, otherwise the silicone buds do look round in the package) instead of perfectly round and they seem to fit in my ear better than any other buds I have tried.  I have VERY small ears so I have a difficult time finding earbuds that are comfortable, and these fit the bill.  The in ear part is also slightly off center so they seem to block noise better and have a more secure fit.  I have shaken my head around quite a bit with these in and they refuse to fall out.  Other buds have not been so kind to me.  The sound is acceptable, and for the price you seriously cannot go wrong.  They come with three different sized in ear pieces.  They are a little more difficult to swap out due to the shape of the bud post being oval and the bud itself being round, but it isn't that big of a deal. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(890, 904)"

The only thing I find remotely useful is having an iPad or iPhone and watch youtube or amazon instant from it. All you need is to spend another $300 - $400 more to get this functionality. I am very disappointed with this for that reason. The apps/channels are limited. It seems to be yet another $100 accessory to an iPad/iPhone. On its own, I think the market has better products that offer more, like Roku and Chromecast, either better price or more features.I was looking forward to mirroring functionality of this as well, but again I was disappointed, the video pauses and then tries to catchup and the audio keeps cutting in and out. This happened with simple things like trying to play a slideshow from iPhoto. Watching videos or mirroring a game is out of the question. I am not really sure what use it is. Maybe PowerPoint without transitions or displaying something static.If you are an Apple-only fan and have the full apple suite, this product my be for you because I'm sure you can overlook all of these issues that I have had.I would suggest looking into Roku or Chromecast, or if you have PS3/4, Xbox360/One, or a Smart TV, you probably have the majority of what this offers.

I would say it covers 95% of my need, but when I see this nice touch screen universal remote from Logitech that requires internet/software to sync up, I thought maybe I should pay $160 for the touch screen, and given that it would always have the latest update, it must cover all the edge cases and 100% of my need!  Well boy was I wrong--I didn't even get 1% out of this remote!First I am fairly comfortable w/ computer and I have never had issues installing/updating any software, so it's surprising to me that they can screw this up.  But after running into the below issues, I am going to return it (nope, not going to waste time calling their CS)1.

After configuring the software w/ all the  devices, I try to update the H1 remote.  The update got stuck at 3%.3.  It recommended me that I disable my anti-virus and firewall (already off).  So I did and tried again.  Same problem.4.  Googled ""harmony one stuck at 3%"", turns out it's a common issue (so common that when I typed ""Harmony one st"" it autocompletes ""Stuck at 3%"").  There's supposed to be an alternate way to update using a website (If that's the case, why do I need to install the software on my computer!?)5.

B001PIBE8I,electronics,What is remote control?,"When I set this up, I was really happy with how easy it was. Basically, you plug it in and then register it on your computer. Depending on which programs you will use with it, you just go onto your computer and enter a code and everything is set up.That being said, while I still truly love this player, I have a couple of issues with it.1) I am always afraid that I will lose the remote. It is so small.2) The remote is erratically responsive or unresponsive. It seems like you have to get it at the exact angle for it to work correctly. This can be annoying.3) It got unplugged one day, and my amazon.com video library did not show up anymore. I'm not sure if this was an amazon.com issue or a roku issue, but I had to uninstall the amazon on demand program and then re-set it up.4) The quality is not always what I would expect HD to be even though I have it plugged in with a gold HDMI cable. Sometimes, there is a lot of pixelation, and I have a top-of-the-line LCD tv.Despite these small issues, you can't beat convenience. I used to plug my laptop into the TV, and this ROKU makes it so much easier. I don't have to plug in speakers or make sure the laptop is charged or set the screen on my laptop or the myriad of other issues I had before.If you are someone who can overlook the small stuff and enjoy the convenience, this is a great player.****UPDATE!**** 9/18/10I think I may have had a bad unit the first time around.

B00BGGDVOO,electronics,Do you have any computer with mouse?,"After deciding to ditch cable TV I started to research alternative set-top-boxes that can provide on-demand content in addition to allowing live streams. The Roku showed up everywhere - blog posts about ditching cable, forums, and reviews. This encouraged me to take the plunge.I was quickly disappointed - the Roku is not a cable box replacement. Nearly it's entire library and design is only centred around the idea of on-demand content, not live streams. The Remote control included is ONLY Wifi, with no Infrared, so if you want to program your universal remote with it you're all out of luck. Neither me nor my spouse liked this included ""toy"" remote or the interface design.The big problem with it, in my opinion, is that each channel is completely separate. Say you want to watch a movie, or see what is streaming on a twitch channel or talk radio station - you have to go into that specific channel/app then look, and then go back to the home screen and move onto the next channel - rinse and repeat. If you've just got home from work and are tired you just want to relax in front of the TV, and the Roku does not provide that experience - if you have lots and lots of channels it's just not possible. This would be excusable if it was android based using existing apps, but this is a brand new platform, they could have done so much more, yet it offers nothing more than many gaming consoles or android mini-PCs.If the Roku could smartly combine my YouTube subscriptions, Netflix movies, and show me what shows were playing on live streams, all at the same time, it might be onto something. It would be great for independent content creators to make their own live streams that could be installed and immediately show up in a central guide. This limitation makes the technology feel early and I don't want to be an early adopter, especially if it doesn't feel like the device will ever become this.I will give some positives - the interface is very fast, certainly the fastest Youtube and Netflix interfaces I've ever seen on a non-PC. The design is slick and the way the Media Player can read NTFS drives is a good feature not often seen on devices like this.Ultimately I decided to return the Roku to Amazon. There are different devices slowly appearing which will offer better Cable box replacements as time goes on, here are a couple of examples:- ""Mohu Channels"" integrates Android Apps and Over the air TV into a single guide, due to be re-released sometime this year.- Channel Master DVR+ which also receives (and records) Over the air TV and includes Custom Apps in the guide (currently only Vudu but more are promised for this year) ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2651, 2665)"

The default auto-focus doesn't work to great in the dark, but the quick auto-focus is nice since it shows you green boxes where it's focused.  It's nice that you can zoom in using the LCD screen so that you can ensure your focus is good, but unfortunately, this doesn't work while in video mode.There's not fully-automatic auto-focus in video mode, but usually the cameras that do are too noisy.  You can change the settings so that half-way pressing the shutter button makes it refocus, but it does the slower method and changes the exposure while it focuses.The battery lasts plenty long when doing photos, but video...not so much.

The 4 ports are full, everything else is run through the wifi including the new Wii.  I port forward HTTP, FTP, SSH, Oracle, and Terminal Services through to statically assigned IP addresses and everything else is making use of the routers DHCP services.  In short -- I think it is getting a pretty good test!Setup was a breeze, but that is standard for Linksys routers I have found.  The instructions were clear and would allow an absolute idiot to set this up although I didn't need them being familiar with their other routers.I live in a largish apartment, and rather than being in a central location the router is squirreled away in the corner office on top of a desktop and below my TV - not ideal I know but the coverage throughout the apartment is always at maximum strength, is as fast as can be expected and I am happy.  I often play online games in my living room on the opposing side of the apartment without problems of laggyness.I first turned on the router in July 2007.

B008RDI0TU,electronics,Does this have the ability to use batteries?,"UPDATE:  I've had this case on my ipad mini for several months now and I use it EVERY day.  It has held up perfectly, absolutely no issues with battery or keystrokes.  It had kept my ipad safe and very functional.  The multilayer protection allows you to really take advantage of travelling with your ipad.  The entire ipad is protected- this includes the screen, all ports, sides, front and back.Overall, I would highly recommend the Air Bender Mini. The quality of the keyboard and the protection it creates are great. Blue tooth works great! Immediate response and connects quickly once initially paired.-The keyboard is flawless, does not miss a key stroke and pairs immediately with the ipad.-Charges quickly and charge seems to last a long time.-The keyboard is nice and very responsive, all keys work well and it has very nice options and extra keys. The ipad becomes a lot easier to use since you don't have to switch back and forth from numbers, letters, symbols etc.-The keyboard is sturdy and it looks like it will last a long time.-When system is closed, it creates a lot of protection for the ipad.Possible improvements:Out of the box instructions are not too clear. I didn't know if the plastic hardcover was an additional screen saver or just a place holder while in the box. I tried to put it on top of the ipad but it didn't click into place. A suggestion would be to put a sticker with some instruction such as &#34;remove&#34; or &#34;screen protector&#34;There are no clear instructions on how to install the actual ipad into the top sleeve. I figured it out easily enough, but it took some playing around. Fortunately, I had the time and curiosity, but I can see somebody in a hurry becoming frustrated.There are many options for moving/adjusting/removing the screen, but no instructions/demonstration. You can move it horizontal, vertical, slanted, straight, tilted, it can slide in and out of the back for more options but it takes a lot of experimenting with. I was a little afraid I would end out breaking it before I actually got to use it. It's a shame that it's so versatile but not if you don't figure it out.Another example is the function on the back; the camera lens type thing is a little tricky to figure out. You can't really get a good grip on it and I always seem to drop it not knowing what exactly I did to release the mechanism. I have small fingers, and I can't seem to have enough room to grasp both sides to release it. Once you figure out the function, it great that the ipad can just come off the keyboard protected in a skin when you don't want to use the keyboard.When the ipad is attached, and if you are working on your lap -it always wants to fall back, seems to be top heavy and unless you are typing -you kind of need to hold it so it doesn't fall backwards. On the long view setting, even more top heavy while on a lap, almost impossible to work with the keyboard.Update: I tested the keyboard this morning on a table and it functions very well. The top heavy issue from the lap use is completely gone on the horizontal view and the long view. The keyboard is flawless, does not miss a key stroke and pairs immediately with the ipadI am one to always put a screen saver, then a cover of some form on all my ipods, ipads, etc. This contraption is nice in that it definitely protects the ipad from water, dust, bumps, drops etc. I feel comfortable that my ipad is safe but aesthetically it is not very appealing. Possible some colors or patterns would be nice.A nice addition to the package or to sell as an accessory would be maybe a dual head cable\splitter where one could charge the ipad and the keyboard at the same time if one wished rather than having 2 cables and needing 2 plug ins.***The instructions and the aesthetic value could use some work but overall the form and function work great. I would highly recommend this product for somebody who is looking for a keyboard. The quality and function far exceeds the aesthetic issues with the product.

B00142MUDI,electronics,How is that effect so good?,"This is my 3rd flat panel tv, and by far the best in terms of picture clarity and features.I have no complaints.  The picture is vivid, crisp, and satisfying.There are plenty of hdmi, component, and other inputs so no worries there.  And they all work, unlike my westinghouse unit.  The unit was easy to assemble (4 screws to the base) the online menus are easy to use, and the price here at amazon was better than at any store.  Free delivery and no sales tax were a bonus.I don't use blueray discs so 720p is fine.  The $400 premium for 1080p wasn't worth it to me.Hint: Use a premium credit card that doubles the warranty from 1 year to 2.

I type a LOT in my line of work (Russian translator/analyst), and I must say that the keystroke on this keyboard is very smooth, smoother than any other keyboard I own.  The backlighting feature is very nice, good and bright, and the feature that turns the keyboard backlight off when not used for a while and then switching back on when you are in proximity is very nice.

B003ZX8B2S,electronics,How is the device?,"Although my wife and I drive all over the southern United States for recreation, for some reason I just never saw a need for a navigator. I could always get some kind of map off the Internet or stop at triple-A and get directions, and once I got close, drive around until I found whatever it was we were looking for. Sure, sometimes I'd drive by the place four times before figuring out that was it. Sure, I'd end up in the wrong part of town at a bad (dark) time of day. Sure, sometimes we'd have to run to catch the start of a concert or to not lose our restaurant reservation. But that's all part of the ""fun"", right?Not anymore.Garmin Nuvi takes care of all that. With updated, always current, always correct lifetime maps, it always gets me where I'm going in plenty of time. Unlike a map, it not only tells me where we're going, but it gives me suggestions and directions, like ""stay right"" or ""take the SECOND exit"". The programming and operation is easy, with just a little three-page manual to tell you all you need to know to utilize all of the Nuvi's features. The big screen is highly readable and understandable. And as far as I can tell so far, as long as you put in the correct address, it knows how to get there. I even kind of like the sensible female voice (someone told me her nickname is ""Terrible Tammy"" - I don't know). This unit is desirable because it not only comes with lifetime maps, it comes with all the cords and accessories you need to get it up and running. I have only two small gripes: The map downloading process is painfully, excruciatingly slow. I know I don't have the fastest computer in the world, but it isn't doorstop material yet, either, but the overall software installation, map download, map verification, and loading onto the Nuvi took very close to two and a half hours. Make sure you update well in advance of any planned trip. (I suggest starting it at bedtime the night before.) The other gripe is that the suction cup mount really needs to be completely free of dirt and the windshield where you are attaching it sparkling clean. Any kind of residue on the glass or grit on the suction cup is going to send your Nuvi to the floor, where mine has been four or five times already. Even with those two nits, this is a device that exceeded my expectations and has made travel more, not less, pleasurable. So I'm going to give it the five stars it would have deserved if I had a faster computer and a clean car. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2460, 2474)"

B005HMO6A6,electronics,What size would you find good?,"I am typing this review on the NT38B and will be comparing this to two other keyboards I have used with my iPad - a Logitech Ultrathin KB cover and the Zaggkeys Pro.  Somewhat unfair because both of these items are far more expensive.What I like about the NT38B:The versatility of the cover - being able to orient the iPad in many different configurations.  This is especially helpful when in the field or on transport (i.e. planes and subways)Pairing was simple but for some reason took longer than my other keyboards.The thinness of the unit - it fits in my charger unit without my having to remove the iPad - this is a big plusWeight is nice and light but the tradeoff is that the keyboard is a little flimsy and bends a bit on uneven or soft surfaces (like my lap!)Positive closure on the unit - the Logitech drove me crazy as the unit would not stay closed and almost caused a nasty accident which prompted me to not use it again.Secure footing - many units topple backwards with the iPad in portrait mode - not the NT38B - it is steady as a rockKeyboard - good assortment of command keys and great layout.  The size of keys are good but for my liking, they could be a little smaller but with the same spacing so there is a little more room between each key - this helps with the speed of my typing as I tend to trip over neighboring keys.  The action is pretty good for an inexpensive keyboard but still cannot compare with the Zagg which I think has the best action in the business.  Still, the issues I have had with other cheap keyboards did not appear with the NT38B - things such as stuck keys or repeating keyssssssss, etc.  There does seem to be a slight lag at times but I am a fast typist.  Still, not an issue with the Logitech or the ZaggThis next item is picayune but I miss the lit keyboard I have with my Zagg.  I would be willing to pay $15 more to have that option.Overall, this is the best inexpensive keyboard/case for an iPad that I have used. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1969, 1983)"
B00DVFLJDS,electronics,How do I send a text message?,"A local brick and mortar store in my area started selling these early, so I picked one up on my way home from work yesterday.  This is my first tablet, although I have friends with iPads, iPad minis and the original Nexus 7, all of which I've used before.  To me, this device blows them all away and for the price you can't go wrong.I got the 16GB model because I'm not one of those people who stores a lot of content locally on the device.  I usually keep about 50 apps installed, some of them games, and there's plenty of storage for all of that.  The rest of my media is either streaming or stored in the cloud.  There's no microSD expansion, but honestly, I don't really miss it so far.  Cloud storage shared between your various devices is the future, and so far it's working well on this tablet as well as on my phone.The screen is straight up gorgeous, and content looks clean and crisp.  I'm running mine with auto-brightness and it seems to always pick a good happy medium between visibility and battery savings, so no complaints there.  Small text is easy to read and Netflix videos look great.  The dual speakers are loud enough, but they don't personally blow me away.  They do go to full volume without any noticeable distortion, however, so that's good.  If you're using this tablet for playing music you may be slightly disappointed, but for watching YouTube videos and movies they're perfectly acceptable.The battery life so far has been stellar.  Mine came out of the box yesterday with a 59% charge, and by the end of the night (about 7 hours later) with HEAVY use I was down to 19%.  The battery is technically smaller than the previous generation's battery, but this new chipset uses that power more efficiently and the device sips power in standby mode so this should last you 2 days on a charge unless you're constantly streaming full HD movies to it.  It does support wireless charging using the Qi standard, but I haven't tested that out yet although I fully plan on getting a wireless charging pad soon.Overall system performance has been nice and snappy.  It's my understanding they're using OpenGL for the system UI now, and all the animations and transitions feel much smoother than they ever have before.  Just swiping through and navigating around Android 4.3 feels great.  iOS may still be a bit smoother, but the difference to me is negligible after this most recent update to the Android OS.And my personal favorite feature is the name itself; This is a Nexus device and will come with all the developer goodies that I've come to love.  This is my 3rd Nexus device and I love how easy it is to flash custom software to it.  Within 20 minutes of getting this thing home yesterday I had unlocked the bootloader, flashed a custom recovery and backed up my current ROM before rooting it.  It's only a matter of days until we get custom ROMs coming out for it with cool features added in.  I'm personally looking forward to using the PIE controls and getting HALO running on it.If you're in the market for a tablet that's not too big to be portable, and that sits at a killer price point for the screen/performance that you get, the new Nexus 7 is a no-brainer.

B0052YFYFK,electronics,How is the quality?,"I'm completely satisfied with this purchase.  This wireless headset is the most comfortable set of headphones, of any kind, that I've ever used.  It's a little odd looking, yes, but function and comfort are my priorities in this case.  In fact, I chose the white version because I want it to be obvious to those around me that I have headphones on, and I'm not ignoring them or talking to myself!  I can pull out one ear bud, if someone is speaking to me and I don't have to deal with a long tangled cord to retrieve it and pop it back into my ear.  This is one reason I like this design so much: the cords are short and easy to manage.Honestly, I don't get what the magnetic spots are about?  I only seat the earbuds in the little magnetic pods when I'm hanging them up to charge, if ever.The majority of the product sits around the back of your neck (if I'm wearing it right), so the weight is not on your head or ears, and you barely notice the thing is there at all.  I wear it around my neck,let the ear-buds dangle; when a call comes in, the headset vibrates, and I can quickly pop one or two of the buds in.  There is a button on the left side to answer/hangup. People on the other end tell me the sound is great, even when I'm in a noisy room, or on a windy patio.  The volume control is also on the left side, as is the on off toggle, and the charging port.  I like that this product comes with an actual plug-in AC cord, not another USB thing that needs a special adapter or computer to charge it. Also (I think) the port looks like a common generic mini-usb size, that should be easy to replace if you lose the original.  I hate all those propriety cords!I bought these mostly, so I could pair it with my iPad and watch TV or Movies, while in a room with others who don't care to listen to what I'm watching.  I can get up and walk away, wash some dishes and continue listening without being tethered by wired headphones.  It's especially nice for news shows, where you can keep following without even needing to see the visual at all.It was easy to pair up with my ipad or iphone.  Just turned on the bluetooth on my devices settings, the LG headphones appeared in the list, and I clicked ""connect.""  Within seconds, I heard a few little beeps in my ear, confirming the headset was connected.  The few times that it didn't connect right away, I simply flipped the on/off switch (on the left side of the headset)once or twice, and my device suddenly connected to it.The sound quality is just great for phone calls or listening to a TV show or Movie.  No interference issues whatsoever.  Nice and clear.  Love the controls right there on either side of your collarbone.I didn't get these to listen to music, or even make phone calls, but I like them so much that I use them for both of those functions quite often.  With regular headphones, I hate having to look at the screen and swipe/tap to pause, jump to the next song, or change the volume. Somehow I always accidentally tap something I didn't mean to! But I've discovered that I can control my iPhone without even looking at it, (repeat or jump to the next song) by using the controls on the headset.  FYI: the round button on the right side will Play/Pause music on your iphone/iPad even if you weren't already listening to music.  The rocker type control on the right side will jump forward/ repeat/ jump backward to the next song on the playlist, or in your music library.As far as the sound quality goes for music-listening:  eh. shrug. I'm not sure.  It's fine, is all I can say.  Not awesome.  Not tin-ey.  But I don't think they sound as good as my skull-candy earbuds for cranking up the music.  It's not what I bought these for, so I have no complaints.  I don't want to crank up anything when I'm wearing these, since I need to be aware of what is going on around me, when I'm watching my son, driving or shopping.  (Don't get all fired up now ... I rarely listen to music on headphones when I'm driving!  But I DO use them to hear driving directions from my iPhone, without having to turn down the car stereo, or bother other passengers in the car).I was pretty skeptical when I ordered the LG headset, but after using it for a few weeks now ... it's definitely a keeper.  I love them!  The only reason I didn't rate it five stars, is because the sound quality is fine, but it would be nice if it was great. But minus one star for the lousy instructions. I don't even remember if there was an instruction sheet provided.  But I do recall having to just wing-it and figure out the operation on my own.  FYI for those also wondering: Charge them up first, it doesn't take long.* LEFT SIDE: on/off swith, charging port, volume rocker and phone controls.* RIGHT SIDE: Music controls: Play/Pause Button.

B0044YU60M,electronics,How is the service performance?,"Like many of you, I was drawn to this router simply because it was the highest reviewed wireless-N router on Amazon for the cheapest price.  After weeks of messing around with the setup, I have never been able to keep a solid wireless connection going with this thing, and I've tested it with 3 different computers (two PC laptops running Windows 7 and one Macbook Pro, an iPad, and two iPhone 4's.  I asked to return this item but Medialink would not accept returns after 30 days.  They offered to replace the router and even the 2nd one they sent me was unstable.  I wouldn't have written a bad review if they had let me return the item, but now that I'm stuck with a $50 paperweight I felt the need to write one to warn other potential customers.After spending way too much time with trying to get the router to work, I ended up going back to my Linksys Wireless-G router.  I get higher speeds with the old Linksys with a stable connection.  Originally I wanted to go with a Wireless-N router for additional range but I'd much rather have a stable connection with slightly less range than a crappy connection with more range.After reading some of the comments on the very positive glowing reviews, I'm a little wary about the actual reviewers of this item.  Looking at some of the top reviews, their first reviewed item was this Medialink router.  To me that should have been a huge red flag, but I was blinded by the $50 price tag for a wireless-N router.  I hope you do some research and look at the top reviews and see what else they've reviewed.  A legitimate reviewer would probably have many items reviewed, and the Medialink wouldn't be the first product!Also, I should mention I was also blinded by the bright blue lights on this router.  They are WAY TOO BRIGHT!  Much brighter than the lights on anything else (i.e. cable modem, AV receiver, PS3, DVR, etc.  I had to put a piece of black electrical tape just to make it bearable.---Edit 10/13/2011:  After contacting Mediabridge as a last ditch effort I was surprised that they were so accommodating.  I told them that I already had a replacement router sent to me and I still had issues.  They were willing to grant me a full refund even though I was well outside their normal return window.  Maybe I was just extremely unlucky and got 2 defective routers but I don't want to spend anymore time trying to get this product to work for me.

B005CLPP84,electronics,How is option?,"My apartment complex used to pay for basic cable. That quit about 5 months ago. I didn't want to pay the $30 or more per month to get the half dozen channels that I actually wanted so I started looking at streaming players. I already used netflix so that was a must have feature and I decided to pick up hulu plus as well. What drove me to the roku though wasn't just the compatibility with the services that I knew I wanted to use, but the breadth of channels and other content that I could access (for free) from the device.Since purchasing the device I've fallen even more in love with it. The channel store is very nice it has all kinds of web based content to fill the void left by leaving cable behind. From free things like TED talks, news channels (ABC, CNN, CBS, BBC, etc), you tube, pandora, and vimeo videos. To pay channels like HBO go (which I'm ""borrowing"" a password for from a friend). I don't tend to play games on the roku, but have tried angry birds and it is entertaining and I could certainly see younger kids enjoying the gaming experience on the roku.I was afraid that I would miss out on picture quality by having to stream from online, but from what I can tell the picture quality is full HD. I even get surround sound on many of the movies and shows that support it. Of course you can turn the quality of the video down and this may become an important feature for some users. I went from using south of 30GB of data per month to closer to 250GB per month when I switched all of my TV service to the roku. As long as you don't have a cap this is fine, but if you do have a low data cap this is something to consider. Most services (Netflix, Hulu, etc) allow you to pick the picture quality from their websites, but there is also a master switch in the roku options menu if you want to turn quality down across the board.The interface of the roku itself is quite simple and intuitive. The channel store could be set up more nicely as it doesn't currently have a search feature, but you can also look at the available channels online and send them to your roku from there. In fact this is the only way to get some of the unlisted channels which carry things like streaming news casts from different parts of the country and other content which isn't provided by any of the media conglomerates.The interface of some of the other apps are better than others. Netflix does come with a nice search feature, but doesn't let you customize the homepage to show the genres that are most important to you. The Hulu Plus homepage will organize episodes or entire series by name or popularity. This can be especially nice when you want to watch recent TV as new episodes are usually the most popular and will drift towards the front of the list. On the other hand the TED talks app has no search feature and only contains about 1/10 the talks that are featured on their website. But I can't fault the device itself for this as these apps are created by third parties.If I did have one complaint for the Roku 2 XS it would be with the remote. And its a very minor complaint. I have a logitech harmony remote which i use to control all of my media components and while it works with most items very well, and does support the roku 2 XS it is not as strong as the regular remote signal. I haven't had any problems with the remote controlling other items so I believe the problem to be with the type of reciever used in the Roku 2 XS. Again the regular remote works fine so this is not a huge deal, but something that might want to be taken into consideration if you want to use a universal remote.TL:DRConclusions:Picture quality: 5 / 5Roku Interface: 4.5 /  5 (lack of a search feature in the channel store)Channel Options: 5 / 5Channel Interfaces: 2-5 / 5 (some are great others are lacking)Things to consider:Do you have a data cap on your internetDo you want to use a universal remote with the Roku(read above if you have fall in these categories)Final Verdict: I would buy it again and lose the cable company in a minute ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4036, 4050)"
B000AJIF4E,electronics,How do you get so high?,"These are without doubt the best headphones I've ever owned.  The sound quality is incredible- rich and full without over-emphasizing any part of the sound spectrum.  Bass is amazing and brain scrambling.  Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.

In short, the TV looked beautiful with a fantastic screen and a great look to it. But when it came to setting it up for Smart apps (like Netflix), it would not work. It connected to the Internet and acknowledged the connection, but not a single Smart app worked. An hour call into Samsung tech support, who was very accommodating, proved completely fruitless, as they wound up suggesting getting someone out there to service the unit. It was 3 hours after I bought it, so I took it back and bought a different make TV. I could only imagine how complicated the TV would have been for mom had it crashed without me around, and so in the end, it was better for her to have a non-smart TV hooked up to a simple Roku box instead, which is what I did, costing about the same in the end.

B00BGGDVOO,electronics,What a good selection for all their products?,"The Roku 3 is the latest device that I've added to my home in an effort to replace my cable box. No, the Roku 3 by itself cannot replace all the functions of a cable box but it is a great place to start. The device, about the size of a hockey puck, is truly impressive and functions better than more expensive alternatives.---------------SETUP:From start to finish setup is incredibly easy. I got my Roku up and running in less than 5-minutes. Included in the box are quick-start instructions, the power adapter, the remote (with batteries), and the Roku device. I used a small piece of sticky back Velcro to adhere my Roku to the back of my HDTV, although there are other alternatives sold here on Amazon such as the TotalMount Roku Mounting Kit. The Roku is light enough that even double sided tape would hold the device firmly in place. The only piece you need outside the box is a HDMI cable. The Roku 3 accepts both wired Ethernet and Wi-Fi. I chose the latter and I'm happy to say that Wi-Fi works perfectly. The main reason I avoided the Roku products before the R3 model was because I'd heard complaints of spotty Wi-Fi. This is not the case at all with the Roku 3. My wireless router is in my basement on the other side of my home and the R3 easily picks up a strong signal and delivers content consistently without interruption.Once the device is connected to your television and internet you'll need a computer or internet-enabled device to connect to Roku's website and register the device. This is accomplished via a simple pin-code that you'll type into the website. Once that's accomplished you can start adding channels in addition to those already loaded on the device. For folks who already subscribers to services like Netflix or Amazon VoD you can proceed to sign in or in Amazon's case enable the device by following the on-screen instructions.---------------USE:My wife has been making extensive use of the device as we recently welcomed our first child and she uses the device while at home to stream television shows and movies. The interface is incredibly smooth and very refined. No unnecessary navigation or sub-menus are present. Apps like Netflix, Amazon VoD, Vudu, Hulu, etc. are very responsive and easy to navigate. Comparing the Roku 3 to another device we recently purchased, the Western Digital Live TV Hub is a landslide victory for Roku. Other companies will have to play catch-up to Roku's little device as it's very impressive.--------------What I Love About the Roku 3:(+) The remote is fantastic and doesn't require line-of-sight with the R3 box to operate.(+) The remote has a built-in jack that supports headphones/earbuds. This is a great feature for anyone with kids or poor noise insulation in their home and lets you watch programs without disturbing anyone else.(+) The interface is customizable featuring everything from themes to app tiles that can be changed and adjusted. Best of all, the entire interface isn't slow or clumsy. Button presses on the remote immediately translate to a response on-screen.(+) Universal search. Looking for specific movie or TV show but not sure if it's available on Netflix or Amazon? Universal search allows you to search available channels for your content.(+) The small and inconspicuous design is perfect in our living room where we keep our electronics footprint as light as possible. The R3 is very easy to hide and slim enough to fit behind my wall-mounted HDTV.(+) The quality of the streaming content is consistently superior on the Roku 3 than on a similar device, the Western Digital TV Live Hub. I'm not sure if it comes down to the processor or exactly what. I even have my WDTV Live Hub using a wired Ethernet connection and it still displays an inferior resolution to the R3.(+) Has a built-in USB port for connecting external hard-drives with additional content. Also included is a SD-expansion slot for storing content and additional channels.(+) Andriod/iOS app support that allows you to channel surf, change the channel, or display content from your smart phone on your TV.---------------What I Don't Love about My Roku 3:(-) Does not support non-HDTVs. The inclusion of only HDMI output means that only a suitable HDTV will work with the Roku 3. This is probably less relevant today than it would have been a few years ago but still something to consider for non-HDTV owners. The R3 does not come with a HDMI cable.(-) Limited support for external files. For movies .mkv (h.264) and mp4 (h.264) are supported but nothing else. Supported music file formats include .aac  and .mp3. For photos it's only .jpg and .png.(-) No YouTube channel.---------------Overall:The Roku 3 is a fantastic little device that opens up a world of content at your fingertips. The device is inexpensive yet extremely well refined and polished in a way very few other products in this market have achieved. There are some slight limitations to the device but that shouldn't stop you from purchasing this product. Recommended.---------------UPDATE: 7/2/13: I've been using my Roku 3 for about 3 months and in that time the remote has lost its connection to the base unit twice. I've noticed that on both occasions the remote will suddenly stop responding to certain commands. For example all of the arrow keys and the 'OK' buttons will stop functioning but I can still use the 'back' button. The easiest solution I've found is to simply power off the base unit by unplugging the AC adapter, waiting a few seconds, and plugging the adapter back in. The R3 does come with a troubleshooting guide in the manual that covers pairing a remote with the base unit but it was unnecessary in my experience. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(5676, 5690)"
B004T9RR6I,electronics,How is the experience?,"I have no problem with the functions of this product: it has a decent wireless range, set up is easy and it has a nice form. However, this is a product that takes away your control of your settings locally and sends them to the cloud. This is an idea that may disturb some. I was a little surprised to see I had no choice (when I first got this, the Cisco Connect Cloud wasn't online and the setup location was local, i.e., on my computer). Later I went to check some settings, and after typing in the 192.168, etc. address, I could see I was being redirected to the internet and their cloud. I felt a little cheated, like they took away from me my own stuff and from now on I had to go through them to get it. Still, I went through using it and even downloaded the smartphone app, which was neat to have remote control in my hand (if my son didn't get off when I told him, I could kill his connection from my phone!). Things, however, went bad.For some reason, I stopped being able to get to the cloud at all, from my smartphone or via any computer. I was completely shut out of any router controls. Cisco support is easy to get to, but after many back and forths, and resets and re installs, they still couldn't tell me what was wrong or what I needed to do to fix it. So, we reverted back to the original, locally based router management software. On one hand, I like having control back in my hands, but on the other, I'm not sure Cisco is ever going to update or support the old software (they seem to be headed to the cloud, like it or not).Basically, it works fine as a router and wireless device, but if you don't want to give up control of your setup to Cisco's cloud, you won't like this. If you use the cloud, there is the advantage of being able to do some configuring from your smartphone, but it may not be something you use all the time, either.

I started with the Marshmallows and could not believe the sound they delivered for the price (now less than $10).  Not only that, but the fit made them just as good or better than other 'noise-cancelling' models I've tried.  I travel A LOT so I need something that will deliver strong, crisp, deep sound even when I'm sitting in a noisy airport or loud airplane.  These little guys deliver!  I saw them in the store for less than $20 so I just couldn't pass them up...especially with a name like Xtreme Xplosives.  They even come with a hard case for storage and different sizes of adapters to fit all ears.  At first glance, they seem pretty big for earbuds, but when you put them in your ear you hardly even notice the size...until you turn on your music - that's when you'll be blown away!  It seriously feels like there are 10"" subwoofers sitting inside your ears!  These seal up really well also so I can't hear anything that's going on around me whenever the music is on; it's awesome!

My biggest disappointment was when I decided to try the Beats that everyone is walking around with these days.

B00752R9SM,electronics,How is that effect so good?,".We purchased this set after returning the disappointing Vizio M3D470KD  3D TV.We love this set. Here's why.The Picture:The picture was gorgeous, right out of the box. We had no need to tweak the default settings. The quality of the picture is truly astonishing.We may be part of that fringe group of viewers who love the SOE, ""soap opera effect."" We like our TV picture to be as lifelike and ""live"" as possible, so to watch a movie that appears like live TV is a treat. We see no reason to degrade the image so it looks like a movie. If my wife is watching TV I have to ask her if it is a movie or live because I can't tell by just looking at the screen.  Maybe SOE should be renamed LTVE, Live TV Effect. Love that LTVE effect!3D:The 3D is excellent. 3D really does add to the enjoyment of, well, anything. If you are wondering if 3D is worth the additional cost, the answer is YES. Provided you have a source for 3D programming.3D Glasses:The four included 3D glasses are well made. They are a different shape from the usual 3D glasses, which makes them more comfortable for prolong use, even over the eyeglasses which we both wear.The Remote:The remote is a good size, well-balanced with buttons intelligently sized and placed. For example, the mute button is just above the volume control buttons. The buttons are backlit for five seconds when a light button is pressed.The controls are easy and natural. The set is well designed ergonomically.One major annoyance in the Vizio TV was that you had to manually tell the TV that the image was in 3D, then tell it which type of 3D, then say yes, you really do want to view it in 3D before it would present the image in 3D. This Panasonic is smart enough to figure out the type of image, 3D or 2D, and then present it in that format without user intervention. The process is automatic. In both directions.Also, this TV does not get confused and freeze up when I am quick on the remote buttons as the Vizio did.Wi-Fi:I can't comment on the Wi-Fi since I don't use it on the TV, other than to say it successfully found my Wi-Fi channel and gave me access. I may use it in the future.Speakers:The speakers are adequate for us, providing clear speech and decent music. The TV is in a bedroom and sounds fine in that room. If you want movie theater sound you probably need an external speaker system.One negative is that the TV does not have an output jack for analog audio, such as a headphone. Only a digital audio jack.The manual:Panasonic does provide a printed (gasp) manual to use in assembling the base and setting up your TV. Detailed drawings of various possible connections are included. The TV is super easy to setup, essentially plugging it in and connecting to your TV source. That's it. The default picture needs no adjusting, but adjustments are available in you want to play around.  A 199 page manual is available online.  But you don't really need it.It was work to repack and return the Vizio TV using Amazon's free 30 day trial period (although Amazon was great, as usual, and credited us the full purchase price on the very next day after they received the return), but it did let us see how much better this Panasonic is and appreciate it so much more. I am actually grateful that we had problems with the Vizio else we might never have discovered this Panasonic.Packaging:The TV arrived in perfect condition, expertly packed with heavy tape holding the base safely away from the TV.Delivery:Amazon used Ceva for the delivery. Ceva lets you give them a time window for the delivery. We selected the 9:00 AM to noon window so we would be dressed and finished with breakfast before their arrival. However, they rang our doorbell at 8:00 AM, just as we sat down to breakfast. Inconvenient.The box was in perfect condition with no gouges or punctures.Repacking the TV in the box in the future if we need to will be a chore. I snapped several pictures as we unpacked the box so we can reverse the process if we ever need to. I saved printed copies of the pictures inside the box which we stored away.In conclusion:We have enjoyed this TV since July 16th. We like everything about it and obviously intend to keep it at the end of our 30 day trial. If anything happens that changes our minds, I will post an update. I will also post an update if I discover anything else that you should know about. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4359, 4373)"

B003EWNXFU,electronics,What do you think about clasp?,"I was skeptical with this product as it was inexpensive and from a company i've never heard of.I purchased this and the apple ipad cover.  Hands down this is a better product.  It looks nicer.  It has many more positions to place the ipad in--meaning that it rises and lowers at better angles.  The apple ipad cover fell completely short of being something that holds the IPAD in a position that i'm comfortable with.  I like it raised slightly higher--gives better viewing and better ability to use the keyboard.Even the apple store guy said he did not like the limitations  of the ipad cover and recommended a leather cover alternative.I don't know how this will hold up in a year--but to me, the price was cheap enough that it doesn't matter if it falls apart in a year.  It seems like it will be durable though.While some might be comfortable using this cover while the IPAD is standing, I only like to use it in landscape mode.  It seems too unstable standing.You can not use the cover while docking the IPAD in a docking station, however, you can hook it up to the computer or charger without a docking station.I am happily returning the $40 apple IPAD cover and keeping this.  And strongly urging you to not hesitate to buy this.There is an elastic strap on the top corner, inside the cover, to keep the IPAD in place.  The snap that holds the cover closed, remains loose when the cover is open.  That bothers me slightly--just because i don't like the look of it that way.  The  Kick stand (for lack of a better word) is magnetized with what seems to be a sufficient enough magnet to hold it in place when you don't need to use it.With all of that said--I wouldn't pay $70 for this--then again, i can't imagine paying $70 for any IPAD cover.

B00BGA9WK2,electronics,How do you like the design?,"Let me say, I was going to pass on the new generation of gaming consoles because, these consoles simply don't match up well with most of the mid-level gaming machines on paper. However, having played every generation of Console from the Atari 2600 to the present, made passing up the chance to buy one on launch day hard to resist. So, I got the email notification that the PS4 was now on sale and I pulled the trigger.First, I'm not a hardcore gamer by any means and my consoles are reserved for platformers, sports games, and racing games with FPS and RPGs being pushed to the PC. To me, the console is supposed to be fun first and foremost and if for any reason it fails to live up to that billing then, it fails as a console. With that said, let me get right into my review.ENGINEERING AND DESIGNThe console is slim, the graphics are fast enough, and the design is really sharp.It is a pretty nice piece of hardware and it delivers some pretty nice image quality but, in terms of computing power, most mid-range computers with discrete graphics are as strong or stronger but, that's now why you would buy a console.  You buy a console for simplicity and convenience and Sony manages to do fairly well with the design in these areas.CONTROLSYou know, I never had an issue with the past PlayStation controllers outside of the fact that they were too lite and felt more fragile than they actually were. The PS4 Dual Shock controllers feel really good and have a decent amount of weight to them in your hand.The touch pad on the controller is a little awkward in that it serves a function but, it was almost like they added it as a me too kind of feature when they saw the Wii U controller (it is better than people give it credit for). I guess we might see more use for it in the future but, I've only used it for Escape Plan (Indy Title) killzone Shadow Fall (Awkwardly too I might add).The options button, does just what it says, it brings up a menu of features or options for every aspect of the system. It just works and I find no fault with this other than it is a rebadged select button.The share button, I'm dumbfounded by this button, yeah it is cool but, really??? All I can do is share on Facebook or Twitter with it! It's baffling to say the least as I don't see either of those as being the place where people upload videos very often. Where is the YouTube or Daily Motion options Seriously, it is confusing at best unless you're going to live stream your game play (Let's not even talk about the added uselessness of the poor quality videos it records or the HDCP Copy Protection even when gaming).This voice control isn't very good on this console.  First, you won't even know it has the option if you don't plug the mic in to the controller or connect the camera.  Second, there are all of like 8 commands and those only accept a limited number of variables.  Third, I often had to say PlayStation twice even though the mic was literally right next to my mouth!The controller is decent overall but, the voice controls are average at best.The one caveat is that the Xbox One brought Kinect Interaction with voice commands in many 3rd party titles ad those developers actually left them in the Game for the PS4 versions of the games and these do work well.INTERFACEThis is one area where Sony has learned from the PS3.They broke the settings, messaging, and other features off to their own section of the main screen and that works great for me.  This is a big plus over the previous generation.The biggest downsides appear to be in their decision making process.They gave you the ability to upgrade the drive so, you can put a 3 TeraByte drive into the machine but, all of your apps install to the center line on the console and that could honestly become huge and unmanageable (Even if the most recently used are in the front).  What makes this even more bizarre is the fact that this very line has a folder called Library but, do they put everything in there?  Nope, just the digital stuff!  Why?  Seriously, move all the apps to this folder and let us choose what's on the main screen!Another flaw is in the Battery Meter implementation.  When you first sign in to the console, yhe meter is in the upper right hand side of the screen and disappears...  After that you tap the PS button and WTF??? nothing happens??? You then learn you have to hold the PS button in, go all the way to the log out screen and you find the meter again but, it isn't in the upper right as large as day!!! Nope, it is now a tiny icon in the lower right near your name.  Not sure what they were thinking here but, this is poor design.LAUNCH GAMESThis is a big area where I feel like Sony dropped the ball as most games are only slightly above average and none of them (even to this day) will blow you away or make you feel like you've gotten your money's worth from the system.Killzone: Shadow FallThis is pretty much a straight up FPS where the opening cityscapes look very cool but, the game isn't free roaming at that point so you can look but don't touch...  As you get further into the game some of the visual quality degrades fast (The flowing river looks like it is from the Quake 1 days before the Monster 3D).  For the most part, I've found the game boring to say the least even if it does look stunning in parts.KnackThis is a pretty much a hack and slash 3/4 overhead platformer and honestly it has gotten mistreated by the media.  The game is actually a lot of fun but, not as visually pleasing as its other launch siblings.  This game represents the realization that good looking does not always mean most fun and to me, I'm relearning this with this generation of consoles.ResogunThis was a PSN freebie and while it is cool, it is pretty much a copy of the Classic title Defender on Steroids so, if you liked Defender, you'll likely love this game.  I had some fun playing it but, like Defender, I never really got into it.PLAYSTATION NETWORKThe PSN has only a fraction of the servers that Xbox Live has and this was something I hadn't realized when I purchased the PS4. While this hadn't been a big issue since launch, it became a much larger issue with the opening of all those Christmas consoles as the past week has had a lot of lag when trying to play games online and even making a connection is sometimes a challenge.The plus side to the network is that you can use Amazon Prime, Netflix, and other streaming apps without having a membership to PlayStation Plus where as Xbox requires a Live Gold membership to even use those apps.Another benefit is the fact that you get free games that are yours as long as you keep a membership with PS+.Also, game sharing is a feature of the PSN network but, you have to login to the other persons console to download the games to it is kind an awkward sharing feature that isn't very practical.A PS Plus membership does allow up to 5 accounts to play games online but, only the primary member has cloud sync capability and this creates an issue when a company like EA screws up and writes all saved campaign data to the cloud.  With the Xbox Live, you everybody gets access to your Live Gold service and all of its features so, everybody gets the cloud on Xbox One.INTERFACEThe Sony interface is pretty straight forward and familiar to most.There are two rows of icons where the first row is pretty much set and it will always be the same regardless of what is installed on the system. The second row is where your library and games are stored and honestly, this row is kind of annoying because you everything you install forms one giant horizontal row of apps and games and that to me is out of control!Overall it is pretty simple to use, in some ways it is easier than Xbox One but, not in others.For instance, they gave you the battery indicator but, it appears one place when launching the system and another entirely when using the system, that's really poor for continuity if you ask me.CUSTOMER SERVICEHere's where the wheels fall off the console! The previously mentioned issues with NBA 2K14 are a big enough issue that I approached Sony for a refund as I bought the game on a digital download... Not only did they refuse to help with the situation, they pretty much didn't even see the connection between me buying the game from them and their level of responsibility with that.I spent a good 30 to 40 minutes arguing with the Sony Support reps and pretty much left with the resolution that they're never going to help me and I'm not going to buy another digital download from them!Sony Support angered me so much, I actually did sell the console about 6 weeks later and while this wasn't the only reason I sold it, it was a big reason why.Of course, on a side note, 2K finally reached out to me and told me they would give me all my VC back if I delete my player and start over. That stinks but, it is either that or lose the money and the fact that it took them 3 weeks to even acknowledge my request with no help from Sony at all leaves me questioning Sony's commitment to their customers and I will never buy another digital item from Sony and I'll be passing on Take Two games in the future.MISSING FEATURESFirst, I had no idea the console didn't support 3D Bluray when I bought it and I also had no idea that DLNA and even playback of movies or music from USB Media wasn't allowed either!Let me just say that both this and the Xbox One are incomplete consoles. However, this is a pretty complete list of things this console cannot do.*No YouTube uploading*No YouTube App #1 Video sharing service and no support at all.*No Google+ Support (this affects YouTube or it wouldn't really matter)*No Streaming or Playing of MP3 or MP4 files (not even from your PC or USB drive)*No Support for external hard drives at all at this point (most of the list comes from Sony)*No Sony Support for apps purchased from their digital store (so buy the hard copies)*No Ability to rename your online account (MS does this but, it will cost $20)*No Promoting a Child Account to an adult account, they get to start over*No Suspending or Resuming Games or Apps*No Support for 3D BluraySome of you might be okay without these features but, some will no doubt not like this at all.CONCLUSIONI'm torn between love and hate for this console and its creator. I really do love the console but, I really hate Sony right now and unfortunately, you cannot have one without the other.Overall, the lack of DLNA support, 3D Bluray, Removable Media Support, Poor Sony Support, Poor game library,  and a console that is even less complete than the Xbox One are all factors as to why I decided to sell the unit.Maybe some day I'll revisit this console again but, Sony has a real problem on their hands in my opinion because they have a console that lacks all the best features of their previous generation (and many of those from their competition).  I know most people say, that Sony is really focused on gamin and they had better be because the Console doesn't do very much else!What you really get here is a console that is focused on games and yet doesn't have a single game that would make you run out and buy it at the moment.  Sony is presently selling these units based on a spec sheet but, when people start to realize it isn't very fun, those numbers might just drop off pretty fast!I would say, pass on this console until they get more games out because, what they have now isn't worth it!

B004QK7HI8,electronics,Does this product is good quality?,"We were trying to live simply and watch less television. We also wanted to save some money by discontinuing our Dish Network service. At first, I was thinking about purchasing an external HDTV antennae but was daunted by the installation. I then decided to look at indoor antennas and came across the Mohu Leaf. I was intrigued that it got excellent reviews. I wasn't very hopeful because of our location. I live in Apex, NC and our subdivision is surrounded by a lot of trees and we get poor AT&T; cellphone service. But I was encouraged that Mohu has a great return policy. I figured that if it didn't work, I will just return it.I plugged it into my HDTV and had the television do a channel search. The first time I did this, I did not get a lot of channels but after moving it a couple of times (and having my TV do another channel search after each move), I was able to get 19 channels! Among a few minor channels, I got the major networks including PBS, CBS, ABC, Fox, NBC, and The CW. And guess what, at normal viewing distances, the picture quality is comparable to Dish!I'm even contemplating of buying a DVR. There are a few devices that don't even require a monthly subscription. But I'm still thinking about this. It's very tempting to be able to record all the network shows like Fringe, Desperate Housewives, or Dancing with the Stars. My main goal, after all, is to watch less television.Very soon, I will cancel my Dish service and this $44 antennae is going to save me lots of money. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1501, 1515)"

B002JPITXY,electronics,What is the quality of the headphones?,"As an all out Zune owner, I have always enjoyed the devices and how they would update their devices with all the new features every year, including the old brick zunes. Since they weren't going to do it this time, I knew it was time to upgrade. I got a 32gb HD with no hesitation, there are a couple of things that you need to know about if you really want this compared to the Apple Ipod Touch.What I think is the best part about the Zune HD is its beautiful OLED screen. You don't know how beautiful a video or picture can look on a small device until you look at it on the Zune HD. The black quality on the screen is amazing and the colors are so vivid. Some of the features on the device is really helped out by the beautiful screen that this device possesses.Graphics: With a stripped down version of the nVidia Tegra chip inside the device, you can not go wrong. It has 8 processors making the device working at its best. It will definitely help once 3D games come to the device. Can't wait for that to happen!!!Software and Marketplace: The Zune software is...nice, could be better, could be worse. I like that it is customizable unlike Itunes. The marketplace is pretty, it could definitely have more videos and movies, but lets not forget that they just started with movies when the Zune HD came out. Still, many of the TV shows that I have like watching on CBS and FOX are NOT on the Zune Marketplace, which disappoints me. This can be apart of the review because this is the only software that the Zune is compatible with. Yes, its only on PC, its so sad that people with Macs can't use it, that 5-10% that can just use boot camp to use it. I mean seriously Mac users, get over it, YOU CAN USE IT!!! I have always like the wireless sync feature just in case I just don't want to find my sync cord you can just bring up the software and on the device just click wireless sync. Podcasts are handled on the Zune software. The catalog of podcasts are not as big on Itunes, but that is not such a big deal. What is great about it is that you can choose how many that you want to keep on your computer, so it automatically deletes on the ones that get old or outdated. You can also choose which ones to automatically sync to the device. Whether it be all of them, or just the ones that haven't been played yet and the ones that get played on the device get deleted after you watch.Apps: No store here. People who want a device for apps, its not here. The Zune HD has a very few simple games and only 2 applications. Microsoft has promised that they will be adding more to the catalog eventually, but its not here. The games and apps that they already for the device are nice to have. I always the Texas Hold 'Em game, simple but nice. The newest update allows 3D gaming which is great. Audiosurf Tilt is simply amazing with the screen. They are all free, thats a plus, but the catch is there are short advertisements before the games come up. Thats not such a big deal if you can get all of their stuff for free. I would much rather, though, pay for a valuable app from other developers. Microsoft has to keep with the times and allow other developers to create their own apps. Once Microsoft actually reads something from their reviewers and listens to them, they might get somewhere even further.UI: Beautiful, Microsoft was really working to create an interface for a touch device. They did a beautiful job at doing so. The searching for media on the device is so easy and very quick to learn. I absolutely LOVE the sidebar on the main screen. You just click on the left side of the main screen and this other screen comes up with ""Pins"", which are basically songs, pics, or videos that you like you can pin to the side bar so you can quickly access that when you turn it on. The next feature on that screen is history, which shows everything that you have been doing on the device like songs that you just recently listened to, podcasts, or websites that you view on the web browser. The last feature on that screen is ""New"" which shows the newest things that you recently added to the device so if you just added a song to the device, just go to the history screen and you can easily play the song without going through any menus. You can also delete ANYTHING that you want off your device by just clicking on the item. I know that the Ipod Touch does this, just not with everything.Music and features: Sound playback has always been the best on the Zune. They decided to bring the basic EQ back to the device, which is nice...just not nice enough. A customizable EQ would be great. You don't even need an EQ if you have the Zune premium headphones, with both of them together, it sounds amazing, Bose headphones, get out of the way (seriously)! I love the new music menu features on the Zune HD. First off, the artist menu is amazing. It starts off with the artists picture in the background and it has the basic albums and songs side menues, then theres artists pictures, which you can use as your background by the way, it also has a full bio of the artist on another side menu which is awesome, who wouldn't love to get a background of the artist. With the new firmware update now also there is underlined part in the bio which allows you to click on them, which is normally artists or other albums, and you can use the devices wi-fi directly from the bio and go to the artist or other album and download it with the on-device marketplace. Whats also included is related artists, which has a picture list of all the related artists which you can click on to either access their artist menu, or go to the on-device marketplace and download their stuff. What I think is the best is the screensaver mode when you are listening to songs. It really takes advantage of the screen. It starts after around 15 seconds on not touching the screen. The artist picture is in the background and the information from the screen is scrolling around the screen in all different directions, if you have used the Zune software, you might have seen this feature. Its just the icing on the cake. Microsoft really did try to get the music exploration aspect in Zune and they did a very good job.Videos: Simple enough...with the screen all the videos look beautiful. You can either choose since the device is widescreen to either keep the video at its full screen and have black sides or zoom in and make the video full screen. I love that you have the choice to do that. Colors really show up on this device so if you plan to watch an animated tv show like Family Guy, you can actually tell what color the wall in the background is.Zune Pass: Genius...$15 a month for unlimited streaming of songs and you get to keep 10 of those songs each month. So if you compare it to Itunes...10 songs for $1.29, you spend $13 on 10 songs that you get to keep and that means you get unlimited streaming to millions of songs for just $2 a month. What a bargain!!! You also get the the Zune Pass with the On-device marketplace. You can download songs to the device right from the online device marketplace and even when you get offline, you can still continue listening to it. I love the zune pass and its definitely worth it if you love music.On-Device Markeplace - Very nice to have, especially if you have the Zune Pass. They also have the very few apps on the marketplace and you can download updates right from the marketplace, but there hasn't been any updates to the 7 games that Microsoft supplies.Pictures: Beautiful, scrolling to the next picture and rendering the picture from horizontal to landscape takes not time. It uses the same multi-touch feature to zoom and is quite useful. Overall...nice.Radio: This is one of Microsoft's selling points. This radio is FM AND HD radio. Too bad I don't live near any main radio station that include HD radio stations. I don't really see any improvements in the radio either. When I go to the city, I will let you guys know. What I have always loved about the radio is the tag to FM feature, which is when you get a clear enough reception, it will show the title of the radio station and the song that is playing currently. You can tag that song and add it to your cart which you can download with the marketplace. That is a great way to get introduced and familiar with new music.Social: Still evolving...not there yet. I am so sad that they took away the song and podcast sharing from zune to zune wirelessly. Its gone, now there is a way to send songs with an email address or zune tag (or xbox live gamertag) when you plug your zune back into the computer. What they did do is add your zune inbox if your account is synced with your device, and it displays on your device...which is nice. But it is still sad that they took away the wireless song sharing feature. (It still works with the older models if you still have one!)Internet browser: OK...not as good as the Ipod Touch safari browser. There is no flash...yet. But you get the choice to either use the internet browser as a mobile browser or you can view sites in their desktop format, its a choice in the internet settings menu. The keyboard is small, but isn't every PMP keyboard? The added auto-correct features with the new firmware update, but it is still not as good as safari.This was a complete and honest review. I love Zune and I have always thought about going back to Ipod, but Zune keeps coming out with new devices that can not be refused. Music and video playback and exploration...Zune is the one and only way to go. No other device does it as good as Zune. Applications and web browsing are better for the Ipod people. Unlimited streaming of music and keeping 10 songs a month, go Zune. Paying individual songs at $1.29 a month to keep forever, go with Ipod. There are so many things that I listed on here and probably a couple of other things that would affect your decision. But I hope that this helped.5/17 update...1. the newest zune update got rid of all of the advertisements before the apps started2. There are now around 20 apps for the HD including facebook and twitter...still nothing special. Let's just hope the the Windows 7 series phones apps will be compatible.3. CBS and FOX have both been added to the Zune Marketplace4. They have added the Smart DJ feature to the HD device (like Genius on the ipod, but actually gets better results)5. Direct Xvid compatibility...you don't know how much better that made this thing. Makes the Zune way more compatible that now you can directly add .avi files without converting first.6. Internet browser got better, faster tilt sensitivity and faster overall experience. You can take snapshots of what is on the screen while surfing and save it to the device in pictures.

B002HWRJBM,electronics,How is the connection?,"UPDATE Sept 15:  My original review was mainly positive but knocked off a star for some minor issues.  I got a replacement which fixed one problem but introduces another.  I'll insert comments into my original review.----I agree with almost everything said in the other positive reviews about the great ergonomics, the scroll wheel that you can toggle between hyperscrolling (very useful) and the more common measured/notched scrolling, the many useful features attached to the other buttons, the way you can use the mouse while the battery recharges, and the incredibly tiny receiver that works with other compatible devices.Maybe you're having trouble thinking of a way to justify spending $100 for a rodent.  I was too, but I thought of a way to justify it that maybe a few of you might find helpful:Before now, I'd never spent more than $30 on a mouse (except once, a $50 microsoft bluetooth mouse that doesn't work too well).  But I was never happy with any of them.  They were either uncomfortable after an hour or so of use, or stopped working after a while, or something.  So, after a few months, I'd give up and buy another one.  Over time, I spent probably $200 on a series of cheap mice.When the Performance MX came out a few weeks ago, I saw all the positive reviews (from users and from professional publications and websites), and it occurred to me that maybe if I spent more for a really good mouse, I'd be happy and wouldn't have to keep buying $30 mice every few months.As I said above, in most ways I think this is a great mouse and agree with the many other positive reviews.  But I've experienced some minor issues, too.1.  When you start pushing the mouse around after it's been sitting idle - even for just a few minutes - there's an annoying one- to two-second lag before the cursor reacts.  UPDATE Sept 15:  Logitech tech support figured out that this was a defect.  I got a replacement, and it's perfect.  With Amazon, I didn't have to pay shipping for the replacement, and I didn't have to return the first mouse until after receiving the replacement.  Very happy with Amazon's service.2.  At this time, the number of devices that are compatible with the unifying receiver is very small:  just two keyboards and three mice.  The unifying receiver would be far more valuable if there were more different types of compatible devices.  For example, I would like to see a numeric keypad and also a presentation/pointer that could work with the unifying receiver - logitech makes both such devices now, but they won't work with the unifying receiver.3.  I'm probably being too picky here, but I find the ""click"" to be a bit tinny, and louder and less satisfying than other mice I've used.  UPDATE Sept 15:  the replacement mouse is worse.  The left button makes the same tinny click when you press down, but when you let go it makes a louder sound, almost like a knock on a door.  (The right mouse button doesn't do this.  Go figure.)  This gets annoying after a while.  Sorry, but if I'm paying $100 for a mouse, I want it to be just about perfect.Since almost all the other reviews of this mouse are very positive, I am sure that my experience with two of them each having a minor but annoying defect is uncommon.  In absence of these apparently rare defects, this is a really great mouse. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3313, 3327)"
B000A6PPOK,electronics,How you feel ?,"I hope Microsoft never stops making this keyboard, because now that I've tried one of the wave boards, I can't see ever going back to  a flat keyboard.

No doubt the L lens surpasses this one when you photograph test charts (how often do you do that?), and its weather sealing allows it to withstand thunderstorms better, but frankly speaking, if you're not a pro who pushes the envelope, who cares?If you have a crop camera, this lens lets you take advantage of the smaller sensor - you're not paying for (and lugging around) all that extra glass.  Maybe the extra $800 you spend on the L lens will make a difference in 1% of your photos, but you realize the benefit of the lighter weight and smaller size 100% of the time.  Plus you're more likely to bring it with you.Yes, at longer focal lengths you lose one f-stop compared to the L lens.

B002HWRJBM,electronics,How is the control?,"I've been living with this mouse for about a week.  I've used it for one day on my PC at work and the rest of the time at home on my Mac, running OS 10.6 Snow Leopard.  In both Win and Mac OS, i had instant functionality when i plugged in the mouse.  The special buttons don't start working until after you install the Logitech software, but basic point and click stuff works fine, which was nice.Compared to my Apple Mighty Mouse, this thing is nice because it works the instant you turn on the mouse.  No waiting for bluetooth to sync with the computer, etc.  I installed the mouse drivers on both platforms and not surprisingly, they ""feel"" different.  For example, i like the simplicity and look of the the Mac version of the driver.  There is a BUT here though....  In the Win version, the forward/backward buttons can be easily set as... forward and backward buttons for a browser.  The Mac version has no such default, and i had to tell it to do a keystroke instead, which still accomplishes the same thing.  It's not a huge deal, but a pretty odd omission for something that should be rather obvious.  Not everyone out there knows the keyboard commands for forward/backward.  Wish they made this a bit more foolproof.The feel of the mouse is very good, but i have medium/large hands.  If you have small hands, this mouse will feel huge.  You might consider other Logitech products if that's the case.  It is a very ergonomic shape and i find it comfy.  I love the thumb rest/button.  They got this one right.  It's hard enough to press that it doesn't fire off accidentally, but also doesn't require tons of pressure to activate.  I use it on my Mac to do Expose, but it could be programmed to do anything.  The Windows version of the driver has an Expose-like feature, but it's not nearly as nice as the Mac OS version of it.  Perhaps Windows 7 will have cooler visuals.All in all, the buttons feel pretty good, except for the scroll wheel.  The scrolling is fine, but does seem a bit clunky for a ""top shelf"" mouse such as this.  It feels clunky and sounds that way, too.  If you need a mouse that scrolls quietly, this isn't it.  My logitech keyboard/mouse combo my work has feels better in the wheel department.  The middle button is what really blows on this mouse.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes i apply moderate pressure to the wheel and the middle button works.  Other times i feel like i'm going to break the mouse to get it to work.  For this reason, i reprogrammed the ""zoom"" button just below the forward/backward buttons to be my middle button.  I had no use for the zoom, so it works out well.  The zoom button has a great feel.  So, if you just simply can't live with a mouse that has a crappy middle button, you may want to look elsewhere.  Everything else i felt was well put together and seems to work well.  I tend to use the middle button for Google SketchUP, as it's used for panning the 3D model.  It has other uses, which are probably not important to the vast majority of users.  Heck, on a Mac, Apple used to think ONE button was enough on a mouse.  Silly Steve....  I now have 7 buttons and it all works pretty darn well.I think most people will find this mouse very nice and probably worth the cost.  The new ""unifying receiver"" is just freaking tiny!  The receiver is smaller than the USB plug it's attached to.  It just disappears underneath my aluminum Apple keyboard.  Range on the receiver is good also.  I tested it about 8 feet away and it works flawlessly.  I also tested the mouse on glass.  Yes, it works and works well. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3589, 3603)"
B007B31IAK,electronics,Do you have ports available to do all your required work?,"I was looking for a light and thin case for my new iPad Mini that would give me the functionality that I'm used to on my full size iPads. On those, I use a Belkin Snap Shield in conjunction with an Apple Smart Cover to provide protection and allow me to type or watch video using the Smart Cover stand features. I was disappointed to find that Belkin (or DeviceWear) hasn't got a Snap Shield type back for the Mini. However, in looking for those products, this case kept coming up as a decent, well reviewed case that seemed to offer what I was looking for.The case itself is cheaply made, but is light and fits the iPad Mini well. I actually really like the back portion - the cutouts are well placed and that part is good looking.As for the cover: The on/off feature works and even though the cover is stiff and not as nice as a real Smart Cover, I could have lived with that. The cover doesn't lie perfectly flat, but I could live with that. What I can't live with is that this case will not function as a stand. You can fold the cover into a triangle, but there are no magnets to keep the triangle together. Without those, the iPad might remain upright for a 4 or 5 seconds before it collapses. I can't believe that didn't put anything in there to support the triangular cover. In fact, if they would have included another magnet in the back of the case, they could have made a very sturdy and reliable stand that would have made this a great value.Today, I returned this case and  got a ""real"" iPad Mini Smart Cover from Apple and even though it is overpriced, the stand functionality is solid. I feel confident when I roll up the cover to make the triangle, it's not going anywhere. Additionally, the quality of the cover is much nicer and feels much more comfortable folded back behind the iPad. I appreciate these things, but would have been happy with the Poetic case, if they would have only added something to make the stand work.

B0074FGLUM,electronics,Does this hotel meet expectations?,Our 32and 26 Samsung LCD's had the capacitor failure Samsung is paying to fix. The 26 was fine but the 32 main board had a blown resistor as well. Samsung will only fix the capacitors and not anything that may happen to the LCD due to cascade failure! Anyhow the price to fix the 32 was close to $300! So for a bit more we bought the 40 with Smart TV.We had tried the better Samsung 40 LED with 3D and faster processor in the past but found the picture with the faster processing to be fake looking and would turn that feature off.

Sure you could turn the volume up; and we have; but it becomes too loud.It took a bit but I finally got the screen / color settings to our liking. Our set had a push to the red side and flesh tone was off most of the time. Even now it will shift from time to time. One second the flesh tone will seem fine and the next it looks like everyone has a tan or slight sun burn. Not sure if this is due to the background colors present. Another item is the off screen angle doesn't seem to be as good as the higher level sets. Colors and settings are a personal choice and some might light the all the settings on and the picture really bright. I prefer the subtle approach and will turn most settings down. If you turn on the Black enhancement features to full you will crush you your shadows and details. I found there to be enough settings to make the adjustments that were needed. Also this is a 60Hz set with 1080p. Don't let the 60Hz scare you or be fooled into needed the 240Hz. The picture is great and as stated before we found the higher speed sets to look fake. Almost like watching a live play.The Smart TV works great for us. We have it connected via a hard connection and are not using the wireless. Having the wireless is a Great feature but a hard connection is always best if you can. The update has added Amazon Prime to the menu which is something we were looking for. We were using our PS3 to connect to Amazon Prime and now only use the Samsung to do so. Amazon Prime has quit a bit of children programing and my son loves Thomas the Train.The remote has all the functions you will need and lights up! It also controls our PS3 if we watch a Blu Ray!The downside. This TV doesn't have a swivel stand! Out 32 Samsung did and we need this feature so everyone can see the set. Also with the weaker off angle on this set it is needed to direct to the screen to the viewing area. This is mainly need for us because we have the TV in the corner. If you had the set straight it would be fine. We bought this TV Swivel at Amazon that works great -B009UDTUNGA minor but weak area is the cable retainer. It does not stick to the stand! The stand has a small area that is not flat to attach the retainer to but the double sided tape to hold the cable retainer to the set keeps falling off. The cable retainer held firmly on one older 26 and 32 Samsungs.For the price it is the perfect set for our living room. We use the Pioneer for our home theater setup. I would recommend this set.

However, one should not discount the Rebel's plastic body. It's made of polycarbonate. I did a little research on this material and found that it is virtually unbreakable and in laminated form is used to make ""bullet-resistant glass."" Of course, no matter how tough the body is, something else will break, such as the lens or the internal workings, if the camera is dropped on a hard surface. That's why I always place the camera's strap around my neck before handling it.Although a couple of reviewers stated that the camera feels too light, I've found that it has plenty of heft with my 28-135mm lens.The Rebel XT is an excellent camera.

B0030MITDK,electronics,How is the image of the company?,"My Playsport died halfway through my honeymoon. I am astounded by the poor durability of this unit and am glad I brought my Canon camera w/ UW case as a backup and standby. The Playsport doesn't seem to handle humid conditions well. After getting in the water (no more than 4-5 feet of water in 80-85 degree water temp, 90 degree air temp and 70%~ humidity), I noticed the Playsport was having issues turning on underwater. I immediately got out and started noticing condensation build up on the inside of the screen.  After turning it on again, I started getting a blank white screen and the unit would shut off afterwards. I tried letting it dry out but the unit was just dead. After several days of the malfunction, while on the trip, I noticed some corrosion around the power plug port area and hinges. The seals seem a bit flaky in this respect. I made sure to rinse the unit off with freshwater after every outing.The kicker is that I had used this probably a dozen times in the saltwater without any problems. I'm thinking it's not as rugged as it's cut out to be. After considering how much I used it, I put it through a pretty good stress test overall. Unfortunately, it failed. Kodak support didn't seem very supportive of the issue - they wanted me to return the camera, at my expense, with a 7-10 business day turn around. I didn't really want to deal with the back and forth and an experience like that left a bad taste in my mouth anyway. I'd prefer not to be Kodak's QA dept.That said, the video quality is awesome with what I did capture, but I cannot recommend it to anybody with the problems I've experienced. Maybe it was just my unit, but with this experience I will generally be avoiding Kodak products in the future. This, along with so many other reviews of batteries not working and units not charging, is only proving that Kodak's QA process is shoddy at best.I would avoid this unit until Kodak makes major improvements to the ""waterproofing"" aspect as well as all other issues people have been reporting. Personally, I'm going to wait until more companies release comparable waterproof cams (and better reviews) before making such a purchase. My recommendation is this: be very careful with this unit if you plan on using it for a lot of swimming/snorkeling/underwater stuff - it only takes one time underwater for your camera to be destroyed. And also, be wary of the unit's ability (or lack thereof) in places of high humidity. Otherwise, I'd say it's a bargain camera for anything else. It just doesn't seem as ""rugged"" as it's cut out to be.An additional tidbit or caution to note while handling this underwater. Make *sure* you have a secure hold/grip on this unit or that you secure it well using the wrist strap or whatever you come up with. This thing will sink like a brick if you let go of it in the water! If I had brought it to the place we snorkeled where I brought my Canon (and let go of that...fortunately it floated), I almost surely would have dropped it to the bottom 30ft down. And I would have had a fun little diving excursion in that case. Not to mention, likely a dead camera as the rated depth UW is 10ft :T ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(3160, 3174)"

I have nothing bad to say about the camera now. This is by far the best camera at the price point!(Original Summary)I have been a D7000 user who just got D600. This camera is right at home for me since most controls are similar and better. I am not 100% happy with the AF speed in low light, but hey I did not pay that much, so I should not complain. I love the image quality at lower ISO. However, I envy Canon 5D Mk3's low light performance. D600 at 6400 ISO is usable, but it can get pretty noisy in shadow area. Sony sensors have better DR for sure, but no matter what DxO says, Canon 5D MK3 got better high ISO performance. This issue too I should not complain since I did not pay 5D Mk3 price. As a result, this is still the best camera for me who owns several Nikon lenses. When I first heard that D600 had 12 Mega pixel less than D800, I was hoping D600 would get less noisy than D800. It turned out that they are both similar in low light performance. I guess I was expecting too much from an affordable FF camera.Pros:1. D7000 like controls with improvements2. Amazing image quality at lower ISO3. Affordable Price4. Smaller body5. Faster Continuous Shooting than D8006. Amazing Dynamic Range7. Build-in Flash, HDR, and Timelapse mode8. Supports most Nikon lenses9. Not many people talk about this, but I love the LCD cover on Nikon cameras for protection.10. Battery life is much better than Sony SLT or mirrorless cameras11. Much better Auto ISO setting than D700012. 39 AF points. Yes, the AF area is smaller, but I am OK with it.Cons:1. No aperture control in live view and in movie mode!!! Why?!!! I guess to implement a powered aperture mechanism in a live view costs.2. I thought Sony sensors had better low light performance than Canon sensors in general like in APS-C. D600 still performs much better than D7000 in low light, but I was hoping D600 does little better than what I see from ISO6400 images.3. The AF system suppose to be the same as D7000 or better, but I often get hiccups in low light where D600 sits for a second or so.4. 1/4000 shutter speed, which is slower than D7000. Well, the D600 sensor is bigger, so I guess that is max they can do for the price.5. This is not about the camera, but I was hoping Nikon bundled a better kit lens like Canon 24-105L lens. I guess Nikon 24-120 F4 is too much to bundle as a kit lens then.All in all, I am very satisfied.

B00DVFLJDS,electronics,How would you rate the battery life for the radio?,I was a previous owner of the 2012 Nexus 7 which I loved at first but quickly became frustrated with due to performance issues.If you are thinking about upgrading the new 2013 Nexus 7 is almost better in every way.Things I like:- much better performance even in chrome (although maybe not perfect)- MUCH better screen. I honestly don't care whether it is high res or not but the old Nexus 7 had almost yellowish whites and uneven backlighting. This screen is 100% better.- another note about the screen. I was very worried that it wouldn't get dim enough for reading in the dark but it isn't any more troublesome than my old nexus 7 and it gets VERY bright for outside reading.- sound from the speakers seems better- I'm very happy to not have any of the main bugs (GPS and touch issues) that others are complaining about.Things that could be better:- the battery life while actually using the tablet isn't as good as the old Nexus 7. It isn't bad but I could use the battery up in a single day with a long web browsing session if I wanted to.- it is a little harder to hold - a combination of the back being less grippy and the side bezels (in portrait) being much smaller.- the screen can be overly sensitive at times. I don't think this is the same as the ghost touch bug because I've checked that the screen works properly with an app and I have no issues using swype. But I often accidentally click links or zoom in when web browsing- chrome still kind of sucks but that is chrome's problem.Overall I'm happy with my upgrade and I would definitely recommend this tablet to anyone.

B00FEE7B1I,electronics,What color is brighter?,"I've been running the Dell Venue Pro 8 daily for about a week now so I'll give you my brain dump.The form factor really appeals to me. Super light, almost pocketable size makes it really easy to just pick up and go anywhere with it. 10&#34; tablets always make me think (albeit only briefly) about were I'm going to stash it.Battery life has been pretty much right on the &#34;all day&#34; claim, assuming that you stop to eat every few hours and aren't playing online games and pooping in a diaper. I can surf the web essentially all day, at least as much as I can stand.Screen is good, but I've seen way better IPS panels than this one. Brightness is good when you disable the auto-management function. People who bitch that the resolution is too low have NO idea what they're talking about. The screen is only 8 inches! Any higher resolution and you'll need a magnifying glass to see the menus. Seriously. This is Windows, not Android and it handles DPI differently.Performance is impressive considering there's no active cooling at all on this. The combination of quad-cores and SSD makes everything very snappy. The processor benchmarks similarly to a Core2Duo and just under some of the slower Core i3 chips. Processor heavy apps won't be impressed (haven't tried Photoshop or anything like that) but everything else runs smoothly.Really does cold boot in seconds and resumes from sleep instantly.Single micro USB port can't simultaneously charge the device and run USB peripherals without a little trickery. That said I've seen video of it running quad external displays with a keyboard and mouse all through the one USB port no problem. If you're really determined you could run it as a dockable desktop. I got a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for mine to eliminate that concern.Windows 8.1. I don't use Metro apps much, they either don't have what I need or suck 80% of the time. I set mine to boot to desktop. Having said that the Metro apps that don't suck are GREAT. Netflix, Adobe, Amazon, and a few random games rock.Built-in Office 2013 works well with touch and you can tell they put some thought into it.Bottom line: Good performance and the most portable full Windows experience money can buy.

B006ZP8UOW,electronics,How about view?,"Preface:  My camera experienced a reboot and freeze when I maxxed out the contrast to &#34;6&#34; from the preset of &#34;4&#34;.  I noticed no picture quality difference so I returned the contrast setting to 4 after the reboot.I am finding this 640 x 480 quality camera perfect for basic surveillance and security.  It has an excellent mounting bracket and utility/control program.  I mounted it on the ceiling upside down.  The daylight picture quality is adequate and the nighttime infared (doesn't work through windows) is surprisingly good IMHO for such a relatively cheap camera that has two way audio.  The 270 degree rotation plus the up and down range provides an ample range of view.  I was able to figure out how to setup remote viewing by using the port forwarding instructions provided on the website.  The wait for tech support was surprisingly short.  I actually was able to speak to a live person from some offshore help desk.  My questions were pretty basic but I was able to get everything setup and running with a matter of a couple of hours.  I had to hop in my car and drive to an internet caf&eacute; to confirm the remote viewing.  I couldn't confirm remote access in my house.  Doh!  I followed the security advice and purchased a DDNS provider for $19.95 per year to get a unique web address (no need to make things easy for hackers that flock to the free Foscam DDNS site).  The basic utility that allows you to setup users with ADMIN, OPERATOR, or VISITOR levels of access along with their passwords is pretty straight forward.  All this for about $70 plus the $19.95/yr for a unique DDNS.  In short, I am pleasantly surprised how easy it is to do this for such little money.Additional note on the Freezing Issue:  The Contrast is set to 4 and it works fine (backyard/garden/trees view).  I experienced the freezing and reboot when I set the contrast to 6.  It gave some warning signs when part of the picture started to freeze.  I set the contrast back down to 4 when it rebooted itself.  Given that I saw no discernible difference between a contrast of 4 and 6 (looking through a window to the outside) I am not concerned.  The indoor picture quality is acceptable.  Given the slow internet in my area and my desire to add additional cameras, I am happy with the 640 x 480 quality.

It immediately mounted on the desktop, Flip software launched, and the video was sitting there ready for viewing and sharing.  There wasn't a single second of setup time on the computer... not even my iPhone can get video done this well and this quickly.  In fact, I've been carrying the MinoHD pretty much everywhere now - it's just a better video experience, period.The Flip software is really very good and it worked just as well on a Windows 7 machine as it did on my Mac at home. The camera itself is built extremely well, and Flip added nice touches that most manufacturers don't think matter.  Great example: When recording video the aluminum glows red around the glass and lens to let people know the camera is on. They could have just put a red LED somewhere on it, but they really went the extra distance and designed that kind of stuff IN to the case.The USB connector is really solid, too. It folds back in to the case, and a tiny switch flips it out when needed.  This is also how it charges!

B008DWH00K,electronics,Where can I fix my screen?,"This monitor was purchased as a gift for my father, but I couldn't help myself, and opened it up to ""test it out"" for him, for a few days.  Anything to make sure dear ol' dad has a Merry Christmas!The construction seems very solid for the price payed, especially considering that they had to budget in an IPS screen.  The stand swivels and rotates, so that you can use it in portrait mode if you so choose.  Little notches on the base tell you the angle that the monitor is at.  I don't know how often I'm going to use this feature, but it's nice to have.The screen looks great next to my older, non-IPS monitors.  They all look dark and bluish in comparison.  No amount of picture correction made them stand a chance to the ASUS, though they were much older and cheaper monitors to be fair.  the screen is also matte, which is the only way to go.  No annoying reflections from lights in the room.The USB ports are a nice feature.  Not sure if I will use them, but I like having the option.Finally, the price on this monitor is rock-bottom for something of its caliber.  It isn't a touch screen, and won't bedazzle your desk with its style, but it appears to be a solid workhorse that won't get in your way.  To me, an ideal product is one you don't have to fuss over for years to come, and this looks like a good candidate. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1325, 1339)"

I formatted the card in the camera - still the same amount. I took it out and stuck it in the PC's card reader slot - shows ~860MB memory :-( Another format in the PC - still the same.

B001PIBE8I,electronics,What is remote control?,"When I set this up, I was really happy with how easy it was. Basically, you plug it in and then register it on your computer. Depending on which programs you will use with it, you just go onto your computer and enter a code and everything is set up.That being said, while I still truly love this player, I have a couple of issues with it.1) I am always afraid that I will lose the remote. It is so small.2) The remote is erratically responsive or unresponsive. It seems like you have to get it at the exact angle for it to work correctly. This can be annoying.3) It got unplugged one day, and my amazon.com video library did not show up anymore. I'm not sure if this was an amazon.com issue or a roku issue, but I had to uninstall the amazon on demand program and then re-set it up.4) The quality is not always what I would expect HD to be even though I have it plugged in with a gold HDMI cable. Sometimes, there is a lot of pixelation, and I have a top-of-the-line LCD tv.Despite these small issues, you can't beat convenience. I used to plug my laptop into the TV, and this ROKU makes it so much easier. I don't have to plug in speakers or make sure the laptop is charged or set the screen on my laptop or the myriad of other issues I had before.If you are someone who can overlook the small stuff and enjoy the convenience, this is a great player.****UPDATE!**** 9/18/10I think I may have had a bad unit the first time around. The remote became really hard to handle on the first unit; I had to hold it one inch away and press the button repeatedly, even after replacing the batteries, in order to get it to work.

I have been using it for a week now, and there are NO issues.*****Another Update!****11/5/10Apparently, all Rokus are bad because it has been two months now, and again, my remote is not working. Thinking it was a fluke, I purchased a Logitech Harmony and programmed it with my Roku. It worked for a couple of days, and then the same thing, it stopped connecting with the Roku box.

I then compare that to what users feel the product should do and provide a Pro's which explains areas that the product goes above and beyond with their functionalities and Con's where I (my personal feeling) recommend areas I believe the product should improve in.  Star's are taken away from the product when it fails to deliver what the manufacturer said the product could do.The Chromecast viewer is a great viewer display technology.  It definitely makes TV watching easy, economical and practical.  Big different that consumers should be aware of, this is not a Roku or an Apple TV competitor.  Their are no channels with this system.  The system is probably the most advanced viewer in the industry right now.  The system literally works as a displayer where you can display videos and items from your mobile device assuming that the application is Chromecast compatible.  This part really takes away from the product since not all apps (and for good reason) are Chromecast compatible.  That being said you can also view all computer related items on Windows or Mac.  As the product specifies it requires chrome to do so.  So the compatibility is really around any system that can load chrome.  You can not use window media player per say to view movies or any third party application.  IT MUST have a chrome plugin that uses chrome to view.  For my purpose, HBOGO, Youtube, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, Showtime, and online viewing it works amazing.  Same applies for the phone, i only have apps that are compatible with Chromecast so no issues there.  But i am sure in this community of users that have different needs that maybe an impact somewhere down the line, but for 35 bucks amazing product.Pros:-  Easy to setup.  Not difficult at all but it does require a degree of understanding of your TV an knowing your wifi password.-  Delay is pretty amazing, from computer to Chromecast only about a 1 second delay.  Beats the pants off of Netgear's products and Windows 8 screen display technology-  Audio quality is great, its an HDMI adapter so make sure you have HDMI on your TV-  The software needed to run is simple to use.  One click of a button and its up and running.-  Small and non intrusive.Cons:-  Google needs to add better user instructions on setup.  I know they have a guide but it would be nice on screen-  A win 32 agent or a .dmg app would be nice.

B000MXYD2Q,electronics,What are the delivery options?,"Overall, I am happy with the Regza 47HL167 that I purchased a couple of months ago. I read the 2008 Consumer Reports Regza review and agree with it for the most part. Overall, the TV can be an excellent value, and possesses picture capabilities that exceed several other more expensive brands. It has plenty of inputs for various devices and is easy to operate. It has a severely limited viewing angle that should be considered carefully by some potential buyers and that is the primary reason that I cannot give it a ""five star"" rating. I would probably recommend the Samsung LNT 4661 based upon reviews. It has ""as good"" or better picture quality and a better viewing angle. A comparable Sony will cost at least $400 more than the 47HL167 and you may not notice any difference in picture quality.The picture quality is very good with Standard Def DVD's, and excellent with high definition sources such as PC video files, satellite, over the air broadcasts, and Blu-ray discs. However, viewing angle may be an issue for purchasers who have seating too far to the side of the screen. Imagine the television at a 6 o'clock position. The picture is fine, if you are seated between the 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock positions, but color begins to fade very noticeably when fanning out further. For those with a shallow viewing distance and wide room, I recommend that you steer clear of the 47HL167. The limited viewing angle is very noticeable to me and was cited by Consumer Reports. Imagine my surprise that hardly any Amazon reviews mention it.The colors are very vivid and the 47HL167 has numerous adjustments to help each viewer satisfy their own preference. I suspect that those who have encountered problems with ""Green or Blue Push"" have not adjusted the settings to their liking, or might possibly have defective sets. I have not noted any ""color issues"", though the 47HL167 does have setting modes labeled ""Cool, Medium, and Warm"" which can render the overall color in the direction of blue or green. Motion blur hasn't been noticeable either. Sharpness is excellent. No blotchiness or muddled lines are present.The blacks are very good and I recommend that you ignore concerns about the black quality of LCD versus Plasma unless you are a very discerning viewer. Grey hued black-levels evident with old and/or cheap LCD screens is not a problem. The only greyness that I have noticed is during credits and pre-movie viewing screens with poor quality DVD recordings. During movie playback blacks are black. Partly due to the LCD technology, but also because of the matte screen coating on this particular model, inky black levels of the highest quality plasma set is not obtainable. Other LCD models may have darker black rendering, but probably giving up the advantage of using the 47HL's matte screen. For most viewers, the difference is marginal enough, that it is only noticeable during side-by-side comparison to another model.Two strong characterstics of the LCD technology and the 47HL in particular should be considered. LCD offers a brighter colors and the matte screen option. Though, the Plasma TV offers a darker black, it is marred by the fact that the screen will reflect light from darker screen shots and appear dim in brightly lit rooms. In fact, the displays at the major retail stores illustrate this phenomenon very readily with multiple TV's broadcasting the same scene. The LCD TV's show little to no lighting glare or reflectivity, while the plasma will reveal the room distinctly in a mirror like fashion. The performance of the 47HL and its matte screen coating is excellent in brightly lit rooms and does not suffer from any mirroring effect. Fast moving action scenes are rendered without flaw. No dead pixels have been observed. The screen is easy to clean.Aside from picture viewing considerations, I can't find reason for complaint. Sound quality is fine, and no abberation (like buzzing cabinet resonance) is apparent. Bass and Treble can be adjusted and the unit also has three separate adjustments for Surround Effects. For movies I turn to my AV Stereo system to provide sound, but for TV broadcasts I find the TV speakers suitable. Three  hdmi inputs are adequate, if not using an AV Receiver to handle connectivity/switching chores. The 47HL167's remote control works fine for me, despite lack of back-lighting. I was able to add codes to control the disc players and satellite receiver, but couldn't get the much loved ""commercial skip"" functionality when watching shows recorded on Dish DVR.The TV includes the noteworthy three HDMI inputs, but has plenty of other connectivity options for non-hdmi equipped components: PC, DVD, cable box and antenna. You should be able to avoid using the composite or S-video inputs which result in much lower video quality. I observed very poor quality with S-video connections to a PC, DVD player, and Satellite DVR. For those computer owners who plan to use DVI adapters, beware that you may lose access to other HDMI inputs, if using an adapter on the TV side of the connection. The HDMI inputs are close together and the width of the DVI male connector and corresponding adapter will block the adjacent HDMI input(s). I recommend spending a few extra dollars and use a cable that transitions from a DVI connector on one end to HDMI on the other.The 47HL167 is very comparable in price to similar models offered by competing brands. Though you'll see it listed as high as $2,100, it is usually priced around $1,800 retai, and there have been several special sales on this TV (the lowest sales offering at $1,299).Also note that the 47HL167 will need about 15 seconds to power up, if in the power saving mode. I have encountered trouble when switching to my DVR before the TV is fully powered up. Switching to the input too quickly sometimes brings up a blank screen and a loud pop is emitted from the speakers, when trying to switch between inputs to correct the problem. At this point you'll have to shut off the TV. An alternative is to put the TV on a power mode setting that starts it more quickly, but prepare for a higher electric bill, since the TV will be using power continuously. I suspect that the issue may be caused by the DVR since the problem is absent when selecting other devices.In summary, I highly recommend the Toshiba Regza for those that view the TV from within the limited viewing angle and plan to watch DVD's and High Definition content. If low price is priority, the Olevia and Vizio are fairly competitive. If picture quality is most important, but at a cost under $1,800, then Samsung may be the better choice. Only highly discerning viewers will enjoy the benefits of a costlier LCD model or want to address the problems with plasma technology. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(6755, 6769)"

I chose this one because I like the way it uses a tab to create the triangle, some other just have the ipad sit in a notch. It also has a handle to support it with one hand.Having used the product for over a month I am very happy with it. All the buttons are accessible through the cutouts. One thing to do is make sure the flap that holds the ipad in on the edge with the full slot is velcroed tightly so it can't slip at all. The stand works well - I even just use the ipad in bed, sitting it right on my chest. The magnet system to sleep/wake the unit when the cover is opened or closed works perfectly. My only concern is that I see a slight tear at one of the hinges.  I don't think it will develop into a problem, so I give it 5 stars - obviously if it does not last my opinion will change. (The product doesn't seem to have any additional warranty.)Some buyers mentioned an odor issue when they first unpacked it. I did not have that problem.Since the ipad and case are black, and the ipad works in any orientation it can take a bit of feeling to find the on-off button...I may stick a little colored sticker to make it obvious.

I simply don't trust the Garmin in unfamiliar areas.I bought the 1450LMT so I could monitor traffic during my daily hour-long commute, but I've found that both of the traffic apps on my phone give me much better traffic info than does the Garmin.I had been using saved routes to work around the poor navigation on the 1450, but the latest firmware update has made the routes function much more bothersome to use.I still gave the 1450s 3 stars, because the display is good (easier to read than a smartphone!), although I should note that my wife's 1450 developed a circular dead spot about 3/8 inch in diameter after only a year.  The voice directions are clear and generally timely.  The maps are pretty good, and they do get updated.Bottom line, I'm done with Garmin until they figure out how to route efficiently and correctly.  Sad that a company once a technology leader could fall so far behind the industry. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1671, 1685)"
B005HMO6A6,electronics,What size would you find good?,"I am typing this review on the NT38B and will be comparing this to two other keyboards I have used with my iPad - a Logitech Ultrathin KB cover and the Zaggkeys Pro.  Somewhat unfair because both of these items are far more expensive.What I like about the NT38B:The versatility of the cover - being able to orient the iPad in many different configurations.  This is especially helpful when in the field or on transport (i.e. planes and subways)Pairing was simple but for some reason took longer than my other keyboards.The thinness of the unit - it fits in my charger unit without my having to remove the iPad - this is a big plusWeight is nice and light but the tradeoff is that the keyboard is a little flimsy and bends a bit on uneven or soft surfaces (like my lap!)Positive closure on the unit - the Logitech drove me crazy as the unit would not stay closed and almost caused a nasty accident which prompted me to not use it again.Secure footing - many units topple backwards with the iPad in portrait mode - not the NT38B - it is steady as a rockKeyboard - good assortment of command keys and great layout.  The size of keys are good but for my liking, they could be a little smaller but with the same spacing so there is a little more room between each key - this helps with the speed of my typing as I tend to trip over neighboring keys.  The action is pretty good for an inexpensive keyboard but still cannot compare with the Zagg which I think has the best action in the business.  Still, the issues I have had with other cheap keyboards did not appear with the NT38B - things such as stuck keys or repeating keyssssssss, etc.  There does seem to be a slight lag at times but I am a fast typist.  Still, not an issue with the Logitech or the ZaggThis next item is picayune but I miss the lit keyboard I have with my Zagg.  I would be willing to pay $15 more to have that option.Overall, this is the best inexpensive keyboard/case for an iPad that I have used. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1969, 1983)"
B008RM235I,electronics,How is the white color quality on this screen?,"My 19&#34; 4:3 Viewsonic monitor that I purchased in 2003 starting having issues.  The monitor was taking a LONg time to warm up and turn on.  Basically the capacitors were dying.  I continued to use it before finally deciding to purchase this unit.  At 22&#34; it takes up a wee bit more space.  The monitor is lighter than the old unit.  The image is really clear.  The display resolution is now at 1960x1600.  The buttons for the unit are on the stand underneath the monitor.  A tad inconvenient for constant use.  Okay maybe more than a tad inconvenient.  I had to get a flashlight to see the buttons to figure out which ones to press.  However, the monitor is great.  The stand is very sturdy.

B00007E7JU,electronics,How is the build of the canon t1i and kit lenses?,"I bough this lens for a relative who bought my old canon rebel xti from me (at a great price). Since she is pregnant with her 5th kid, I recommended this budget lens as an all-purpose affordable lens that gives a lot of bang for the buck. Personally, i shoot with the 50mm 1.4 which I love, but this does the trick, especially on a 1.6x body like the rebel xti. Anyone learning photography is wise to get a prime lens and learn to frame shots by moving around. Some say zoom lenses make people lazy. By moving around you can actually find better angles and shots than if you could just adjust a zoom. Sure, zooms are great, but prime's are both cheaper and better, and make better photographers, especially for someone just starting out with a dslr on a budget. The main difference to the 1.4 is the build quality is better on the 1.4 and the bokeh is smoother, not to mention a lower f-stop means lower light shooting without cranking up the ISO but not by much. This is perfectly adequate and for $104 on amazon, a no brainer. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1029, 1043)"
B0075SUK14,electronics,How was the zoom?,"I received my SX260 last Wednesday and have taken about 700 shots and a few quick 5 minute video. Without writing a novel, here are the high/low points of this unit. In addition to this unit, I also purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries (and after market A/C adapters for about $5.00 each) for about $5.00 each and the batteries work fine. With the battery (original and aftermarket) I was able to get over 300 shots (50% flash) with zooming and playback and the battery meter still showed about 25% charge remaining.Pro'sZoom - very long for a subcompact camera 20x optical, total 81x combined (yes 81 times!)Image Stabilizer - Excellent (far superior than the DSC-HX9V); Even at 81x the picture did not come out of focus, but of course not as sharp. I think it's still acceptableScenes - A few scenes; I think the portrait, sepia, B/W works real well (the Portrait+ suppose to blur the picture a bit, but it's not to my liking) It has a few effects (fish eye, toy, miniature) that's very effective and can be fun for creative shots.Auto Mode - was able to pick the correct type of scene almost all the time; it has an easy mode, and smart auto. Not sure why they have an easy mode, but the smart auto works greatSize/Weight - very compact and weigh's 8.2 oz. I would have prefer if the lens was flushed with the unit, but at 20x it may not have been possibleUniformity - the unit does not feel cheap, and beautifully curved; no sharp jagged cornersGrip - the right side of the camera has a nice plastic strip for easier gripControls - Dial extremely easy to use with one hand. The other buttons, if you're a previous Canon user, it's a no brainer; the menu and setup are practically the same across all their models.Screen - 3 inch TFT LCD screen very beautiful; nuff saidProcessor - Didn't notice that much difference between the DIGIC 4/DIGIC 5, but compared to the DSC-HX9V, this camera is like a Ferrari.GPS - Camera has it, but I never used it and probably won't; at least for the time being. Am more interested in a camera that takes excellent pictureCon'sVideo - compared to the Sony DSC-HX9V this Canon comes in a distant second; if you plan on using this primarily as a video recorder, look elsewhere. I think Sony has excellent lens on their camera but their processing technology is clumsy, painfully slow and unacceptable; whereas with taking videos, the Sony does not do any processing (not to mention it captures at 60fps compared to Canon's 24/25 fps) This is one thing I will miss dearly.Flash - not sure if there is a good place but I had to change my grip as the flash is on the top left corner. Couple of times, I had my left index finger on the flash and the camera gave some flash error message and had to power off and power on the camera to reset the flash.If you're a casual or intermittent photographer (or a professional wanting an everyday point and shoot camera without carrying a luggage everywhere) that is interested in looking for a well refined point and shoot camera, yet has manual controls usually found on higher end DSLR (or higher end point and shoot camera), this is it!UPDATE 04/14/2012 - I paid $349 and today I noticed it's selling for $299, a 15% price drop in less than a month! I thought cars depreciate quick ...UPDATE 04/18/2012 - The Live Mode works great! For those hard shots (for example, taking indoor picture with fluorescent lighting and without a flash), you can view the screen and make the adjustment right then and there.

B004T1YAEI,electronics,How is the review?,"I already had a Vizio VX37L at home. A also have an old Hitachi CRT TV that's rated 720i resolution (a very uncommon thing for a CRT TV.) I bought the E3D420VX and set it side-by-side with each existing TV one at a time. I fed the same signal into both the E3D420VX and one of the old ones simultaneously. I compared the two TVs with standard definition 480i digital (from my satellite box), with 480p from an antenna, and then with 1080i from the antenna. (I don't yet have HD service from my satellite provider.)With both types of signals, the old TVs were both noticeably better than the E3D420VX. The E3D420VX was not as bright, even with the backlight and the brightness turned up to 100%. The colors were not as vivid and not as true as on either of the older sets, regardless of how much I adjusted the color settings. With the 480 signals, the E3D420VX showed a lot of pixellation around the edges of everything in the picture. Even with the 1080i signal, there was a little more pixellation than with the old TVs running at 480i. Finally, the sharpness was noticeably worse on the E3D420VX.One major annoyance was that the E3D420VX takes a long time to come on once the power button is pushed. Perhaps the CCFL backlights need time to warm up??? The VX37L does not have any delay.Finally, I was hoping that with the internet apps, there would be a browser so that I could access general internet features (searches, etc.). But no such luck.I next tried a Vizio E421VO. With the same tests, the results were nearly the same; both the old TVs out-performed the E421VO.I decided to try one more time. So I bought a Vizio M420VT. It's a keeper! The picture is bright, the colors are true, and the 1080i is sharp with no pixellation. With the 480 signals, there is still some pixellation, but it's acceptable if I sit back at least ten feet. So it's time to upgrade my satellite service to HD.

I have had a Lumix FZ20, a Sony 717 and a Minolta 530.For the money the LX3 is simply amazing, but don't expect to be in the same league as the reflex camera, especially at high ISO. If there are lots of shadows I don't like using my LX3 above ISO 400 (that's a subjective assessment). I get about a 2 EV advantage with my D300.The zoom is not especially powerful, but it's so bright and compact I imagine it would have been difficult to design one that would have been at F/2.8 all the way.The depth of field is of course much greater than my larger cameras because the focal length is so small, so it can be an advantage in many situations, and a disadvantage for taking portraits.It doesn't feel that slow, probably because I expect compact cameras to be slow.The quality of the image stabilizer amazes me: I'm able to take many pictures inside museums and have had better results than with my reflexes when I wasn't using stabilized lens. Pictures at a 15th of a second are tack sharp.There is very little chromatic aberration in the lens.The flash is occasionally over-powerful.The video quality is so much better than what I had before.I take this camera everywhere, which is more than what I can say about my reflex cameras.It looks good.On the negative side the manual is not especially well written, but finally you can figure out a lot by just exploring the menus.All in all I would give it four and a half stars, but given the price and the use I get out of this camera I'll give it 5.

I don't need the ability for real-time monitoring. I don't need to watch anything over the Internet. All I need is the ability to go back and see what happened at a certain time.How I have setup this product:1. I have placed the camera in a place and position to capture the maximum activity. Camera clamp can be rotated in two axes, but the third axis is rigid. I think they should redesign the clamp/fixture such that there is complete freedom to adjust the camera.2. I have placed the receiver about 10' away such that both antennae are in line.3. Connected the receiver via Dazzle video converter to a computer.4. Computer is kept always on constantly recording the video.Issues with the above setup: (1) I have to change the video file about once a day and delete old files periodically (2) only I know how to manage the whole setup - too much technology for the family (3) captured digital video size (width and height) is small and quality is poor.Alternative setup: Instead of connecting the receiver to a computer, I tried connecting it to an old VCR. Much simple to operate. I have used 6-hour VHS tapes. With this setup, picture size is as big as the TV, picture quality is abysmal. Low tech and family can manage the setup.

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,How was the number?,"The unit I received didn't work for me.

I suspect this could be the reason why this didn't work properly.As a product, my feelings are explained below.Pros:- Price is great; it costs only $35 compared to most set-top boxes which cost around $100- Form factor is very small; it is a HDMI dongle and you can put it in your HDTV's HDMI port although you need to power it from a USB source.- It can cast contents from Chrome web browser (laptop or desktop) but mobile chrome is not supported. You can cast YouTube, Netflix and Google Play contents from mobile devices.- It is not a screen mirroring device (like AirPlay of AppleTV); it uses cloud. i.e. you can stream a YouTube video from your mobile device and can switch off the device, the play on your TV won't stop. And, you can manage that video from your chrome browser.Cons:- Works only in USA at the moment and Google has a bad habit of keeping things in &#34;beta&#34; mode for very long time (e.g. Gmail).- Supports only 2GHz band of your WiFi. This is one of the significant limitations. A device made in the year 2013 has no support for 5GHz; are you kidding? We are talking about WiFi AC standard and this crap doesn't support part of Wireless-N (5GHz)!! This will have impact on 1080p video (sampled at 20+ mbps while shooting) streaming for sure.- Very limited app support at the moment; it only supports YouTube, Netflix and Google Play (music and video). heck! my TV has both YouTube and Netflix app built-in and my android phone has YouTube Remote App; another $35 on such a device is not worth (at least at this moment).- HD video streaming is not as smooth as expected. It has lags and I could see framing issue in the videos (looks like some of the frames reach with some delay) while casting a 1080p YouTube video from my HTC One to TV.- Heavy dependency on High speed internet (and yet it does not support 5GHz band!!)- You cannot play your local files (audio/video); heck! my android device can play those using a DLNA-UPnP app. And, most HDTVs come with DLNA feature, so this is not a compelling need from this device, but it would definitely a nice-to-have.

B00F3SOHNU,electronics,What's the high resolution?,"I purchased this tablet as a refurb through Woot.  The first one I received had a bad dent in the top of the tablet right on the top of the volume rocker.  Woot agreed to replace it.  The second one I received was in ""like new"" condition.  Overall I reallly like this tablet.  Since updating it with the new KitKat OS the tablet is very responsive and I don't experience any lags that other people reported.  I did start having video problems with certain feeds with the new OS.  I would get a choppy, distorted image and bad pixelation. I found that by forcing all video to be rendered by the GPU, (by enabling the develooper options) solved this problem. Samsung has a bug somewhere and needs to fix this with an update.  I also wish Android and Adobe would sort out the Flash video fiasco.  Please kill this dead technology and get everyone on to HTML 5.  Instead Adobe keeps pushing it which makes life miserable for everyone on Android and Apple devices.  Developers need to be mandated to get off of the FLASH content as the industry has agreed to move to HTML5.  Yes, I know, you can still use Flash on this device, but it is a PITA to implement.One thing that is very nice is that you can work with two applications on a split screen at the same time on this tablet.  The downside is that you can only do this with select applications.  Samsung used to have a little tab on the left of the screen to pull the eligible apps out to choose for split screen work.  Once KitKat came out it is now on the right hand side of the screen with no visible tab.  What I don't like about this is you have applications that you swipe content from right to left and you end up pulling this tab out by accident. (Very annoying)  They should have left it where it was.  Samsung has media apps that flip pages from right to left - so putting the split screen applications on the right hand side of the screen makes no sense.  Samsung are you listining?The screen image is nice.  It is not ""Blow me away"" nice - but the resolution is very good.  The colors are very accurate for viewing pictures and watching movies.  It does not use a super Amoled screen and in my opinion other screens look better even though this tablet has higher resolution.  Why Samsung didn't use a super Amoled screen on this expenisve device is questionable.  The screen is very bright and most of the time I have the brightness at 50% or less.The part I thought I would like the best was the S-Pen.  Unfortunatelly, to me this is still awkard to use.  The only pen that works acurately with this tablet is the one that you get with the tablet.  I can't stand writing with this very thin writing instrument.  Samsung also doesn't give you any replacement nibs for it and it is almost impossible to find them anywhere.  I tried multiple other thicker OEM pens including Samsungs own S-pen with eraser for Galaxy note tablets, but all of them have a noticeable offset when writing which makes them unuseable for any fine writing work.  Why a vendor can't make a useable aftermarket pen for this device is a mystery to me.  I e-mailed Wacom, (who apparently makes the pens for Samsung) but they never responded back to me.  I wanted to buy their Bamboo ""Feel"" pen, as it was wider, but too many reviews said it also had this offset issue.  I guess I won't be buying their pen either.  So - if you want this for the writing capability, plan on using the very thin pen that comes with it and when the nib wears out, having to purchase another new pen.  In fact, I'd buy a second one now unless you can find the replacement nibs.  Apparently you can purchase them from Samsung directly, but I spent an hour on a chat line with Samsung service and got no where with them.  If they do have them, I'll bet it is cheaper to buy a whole new pen.Writing on the tablet is NOT like writing with paper and pen.  I don't care what anyone says,  In my opinion it is awkward at best and I have been practicing for quite some time.  Lecture Notes is the best app available for taking notes on this device but it is difficult to configure and set up.  Once you figure it out, it does give you some good functionality.  It also allows you to record lectures with audio and write notes at the same time.  Samsung has their own apps for taking notes but they could be integrated better and in my opinion, are not as good as the Lecture Notes application.  Hopefully Samsung will keep improving their applications for note taking.Battery life is acceptable but not great.  I usually get 1 day of use out of it with heavy use.  I simply charge it over night so I really don't care how long it takes to charge.  It has a very big baterry in it to feed a very powerfull processor so it is going to take a while to charge it back up.  I also hate not being able to replace the battery in these devices.  You actually can - but you have to watch some Youtube videos and do some minor surgery to accomplish this.  I figure by the time the battery wears out I'll probably want something newer anyway.I do like the media integration that Samsung put on this tablet.  The flip up from bottom of the screen function to receive your news, social media, etc. is very nice. Samsung also has a magazine/news application included which is very nice and well integrated into the tablet. They also include a free trial to Zinio for subscribing to magazines.  I'm sorry, but a 10 inch tablet is just not a good reading experience for magazines.  I find I constantlly have to zoom into the text to read them.I actually like the Samsung integrated application launcher and think they did a nice job of making the Android experience better.  Don't expect to get much help with learning this tablet.  I found the information on how to use it is scattered all over the internet.  Most of what I learned, I learned from other reviewers of the tablet.The tablet is quite expensive.  I saved about a hundred bucks buying it refurbished, but it still is more expensive than most tablets. However, when you consider the hardware this has I think it is worth it.  First you get two sets of quad core processors.  One set is for high power use and the other one is to save battery life when using applications that don't need the processing speed.  You get a six core video processor.  You get 3GB's of internal System RAM and 32GB of internal RAM.  I also applaud Samsung for letting you use an external micro SD card.  I have a 64GB card in mine and now 128GB micro cards are coming on the market.  This will certainly give this tablet longevity, allowing me to use it for years.The build quality of the tablet is average.  It's not bad, (don't get me wrong) its just not great.  They make a big deal about the stiched leather look on the back, but it is just plain old plastic.  So why bother?  Nothing about the tablet exudes quality to me.  For the price, Samsung should have included a case for it and made the actual unit out of metal alloy.  I purchased the Roo leather case which has been great.  It comes with a very protective leather cover that you can zip the tablet into and has a nice leather wrap around the tablet itself.  I wanted something that protected the tablet in case I dropped it.  In my opinion, this is the best case for the money as it is all leather.Overall I'm very happy with this tablet.  Yes, there are some minor issues with it and I still don't think the S-pen is everything it is cracked up to be.  I hope Samsung keeps improving it and comes up with better S-pen functionality.I would highly recommend this tablet, but would encourage you to look for discounts as Samsung has just announced that it will be replacing these with newer models this summer. (Including super amoled displays)  Plan on paying a premium for these newer models.In summary:Pros:Very responsive and powerful Tablet (Two sets of quad core processors- six core video)3GB of internal System RAMHigh Screen resolution - (best in class)Accurate screen colors - very bright screenSamsung's app launcher is nicely integrated to make the user experience better than stock Android in my opinion.32GB of internal RAM, can use an external micro SDHC card adding 64GB of user RAM (128GB coming)Can run two applications at once on the same screen (No other tablet can do this today)(However, apps that can do this are limited and you have to swipe from right to left to do it which inteferes with other apps) Even so - being able to have both your e-mail and browser up at the same time is nice. (Even two browser windows at the same time!Needs improvement:Quality and feel of tablet is mediocre and feels cheap for the money you pay.  (Back plastic stiching is cheesy and doesn't fool anyone)S-Pen needs improvement.  Biggest complaint is no other S-pen can be used with an offset issue - pen is too thin.Battery is adequate but could be better.  Plan on getting a full day out of it max in heavy use.  (Charge time is slow)No super Amoled screen.  Screen is very good - but not as good as Amoled screens on other devices with less resolution.Expect a long learning curve with information scattered all over the web.Expensive - Look for a refurbished or discounts to lower the price - otherwise wait for the new models to come outSamsungs customer support is not the best but is on par with everyone's lousy customer service these days.There is no perfect tablet on the market today.  The issues I raised are minor and overall, I still think this is one of the best tablets you can buy today.  If you can find a discount on this tablet, go for it.  You won't be disappointed.  I still think it is the best overall tablet you can buy at this time. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(9658, 9672)"
B00829TIA4,electronics,What is the final performance?,"I originally planned to use this drive for backup of a MAC, but an emergency popped up in the PC world, and I put it to work.===The Good Stuff===* The drives comes with a USB2 to USB3 cable, and plugging it into my laptop immediately powered up the drive and started the download of a device driver.* The drive is pre-formatted for a Mac, so to use it on a PC you need to download an HFS driver from the Seagate website. The info is included in the quick-start guide. I found the driver with a minimum of hassle, it downloaded OK, and after a quick reboot, the drive was visible in the Windows explorer.* File transfer seems reasonably fast- I copied 1.4GB in about 1:40, for an average speed of about 14MB/S.* The drive is a nice form factor. It will just about fit in a shirt pocket-if you have oversized shirt pockets. It weigns about the same as my iPhone, so not real heavy or too hard to carry.===The Not-So-Good Stuff===*The drive only has a USB3.0 port, so you need a 2.0/3.0 cable. One is included, but a USB 2.0 port would have been nice in case you forget the cable.* The Seagate Dashboard software did not inspire confidence. The copy on the drive was corrupted, so I downloaded a fresh copy from the Seagate website. That worked OK, but I could never get the automated backup to work. According to the included manual, on the Home page of Seagate dashboard there is a ""protect"" button to start the backup process. I never got this button to show itself.* The other major selling point of the Dashboard is the ability to backup data/images from Facebook, Flicker and YouTube. I am not quite sure why I would want to do this, and my natural paranoia keeps me from giving Facebook any sort of access to anything having to do with my local drive. To its credit, the Dashboard software seems to allow disabling of this access. Still-just makes me nervous-I don't trust Facebook to be anywhere near my personal drive.* Installing the Dashboard software seemed to load a LOT of software-look like a whole Microsoft C++ distribution kit.  The uninstall seems to mostly work (it did throw an error for a file not found. Unfortunately it didn't seem to offer the option to uninstall all the Microsoft stuff in downloaded, and I am not sure where exactly it put it. Oh well, disk space is cheap enough.===Summary===The drive works great for PC bulk storage. It has a nice form factor, and the HFS driver seems well behaved. I reformatted the drive for NTFS with no problems.The Seagate Dashboard software doesn't inspire any confidence. I never could get a backup job to run, and the thought of Facebook being anywhere near my data is to scary to consider. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2659, 2673)"

B005CT56F8,electronics,What is a quick and accurate review?,"In the last year I've purchased eight Seagate 2 TB consumer grade retail internal drives as external RAID 5 storage.  My initial experience with the drives were good. They performed well and were quiet. However, within 9 months I had two failures. Both failures were immediate and showed no error conditions prior to their failure. Due to the RAID 5 configuration, I didn't experience data loss. Seagate replaced both drives without question, although I still had to cover shipping to send the failed drives to Seagate.Before my 2 TB drive failures, I purchased a Seagate 3 TB drive as part of an upgrade OWC did on my iMac. From the day the drive was installed, I had problems with OS and application stability. Within 9 months, the 3 TB Seagate drive had failed. I asked that OWC replace the failed Seagate drive with a Hitachi 2 TB drive. The iMac has been stable ever since.My conclusion from just my experience, is that Seagate drives have an unusually high failure rate when compared to the same number of Hitachi drives I've deployed. Seagate replaces failed drives without any pushback, but I'm uncomfortable placing critical data on the replacement drives. I end up deploying them into non-critical transient storage or as part of a layered backup strategy. To date, all of the replacement drives Seagate has sent me are performing well.Update: Two months after Seagate sent me a replacement for the 3 TB drive, the replacement has failed. The replacement drive is flagged as being out of warranty, even though the drive is only two months old. I don't expect that I will buy another Seagate product again.

B005HMO6A6,electronics,Does this have the ability to use batteries?,"-Love this product!  I have tried other wireless keyboards, but usually I opt out to scrapping the keyboard and just use the case by itself, but the Airbender Case/keyboard is definitely a keeper.1) It is functional and easy to use as a case and a keyboard.  Functionally from a keyboard perspective I had no issue with sync'ing it up via bluetooth to my Ipad.  Overall the keyboard is responsive, I have not had an issue yet with it either dropping or disconnecting or not recognizing my key strokes.2) Keyboard is nice, keys have a nice heft and snap to it so it feels responsive, almost like a normal keyboard.  Size is nice as well and has the basic keys you would want on a keyboard with other hotkey functions that I like, not having to go through the apple menu options to access (brightness, sound, pictures, internet, etc.)3) Keyboard attached to the Ipad is versatile and works well together, allows for multiple orientations and tilts, one thing it does not do is allow you to extend the ipad away from the keyboard.  Another thing I noticed was If you use the tilt with the whole arm it works fine, but if you try to tilt the screen without moving the arm, it will move back to rest on the arm, not a big deal but an observation I had.  Another thing that I noticed was that sometimes if you had the case open, the weight of the Ipad could tilt the entire case backwards.4) The case itself combined with the keyboard is solid, i have no problem carrying the whole thing around, it does add weight, but what do you expect with an additional keyboard.  I would like to have had the surfaces with more of a rubbery or raised feel so it is easier to grip.  It does allow you to separate the case from the keyboard, but only offers back protection when separate.Overall the case as a whole is great, I do not think I will use just a normal case without the keyboard, this provides so much more function to the overall product.  I no longer an weary of writing long emails on my Ipad now that I have the keyboard to match.  It also provides the needed support and protection to keep your Ipad running for a long, long time!  5***** I would definitely recommend. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2168, 2182)"
B000AZ57M6,electronics,How to claim cash?,"I first bought the Canon EF 28-135mm IS lens to use with my Canon 10D along with theCanon EF 75-300mm f/4.5-5.6 Zoom Lens. About four years later I have sold all my original purchases.  The Canon EF 28-135mm was my most used lens, and I still had it until March 2006 when I replaced it with the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L.Being an L lens, the dust and moisture resistant construction of the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sturdy.  The lens consists of eighteen elements in thirteen groups including one Super-UD glass element and three aspherical lenses to minimize chromatic aberration and distortion.  With a standard twist zoom focus, this lens permits for auto or manual focusing depending on how the switch is set.Some of the earlier lenses had an issue that caused lens flare.  This issue was resolved quickly with a recall.  If the control number located on the back cover of the lens begins with a UT and the following number is less than 1,000, then the lens is affected and should be sent in for repair.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L lens is compact measuring 5 inches long and lightweight weighing in at about 1.5 lbs/670g, and accepts 77mm filters.  Be sure to get agood quality UV haze filterto protect the front lens element. Not only do I see this as a good practice, Canon recommends doing so on their site as well.  The f/stop ranges from 4 - 22. The closest focusing distance is 18 in/45 cm. In addition, the lens has a USM drive mechanism for optimum AF performance, and the pulse control diaphragm (EMD) ensures precise aperture control.The IS system is composed of a pair of gyro sensors to detect vertical and horizontal motion and a microprocessor that compensates for it by shifting special lens elements in parallel with the perceived movement. It is recommended that the IS be off when shooting on a tripod. I have used the IS on myBogen 3231 monopod with legssuccessfully. A monopod is not as stable as a tripod though, with or without the legs. Using the IS, you can obtain sharp pictures three stops below where you normally would. This is a huge advantage in dim light or places where flash is prohibited. Just keep in mind, the IS attempts to eliminate camera movement, not the movement of the subject being photographed.A distance scale ring sits below the focus ring. Turn the distance scale ring all the way to the left and you are set for low magnification close-up photography. Turn it to the right and you are able to set for infinity compensating for changes in temperature as necessary. The distance scale includes figures in red as an infrared index to use when shooting black and white infrared film. Shooting infrared is not available on all cameras. If this feature is a must, make sure this lens is compatible for infrared photography on your camera body.The Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L includes a 1 Year US Warranty, the front & rear lens caps, theLP1219 soft pouch, and theEW-83H lens hood.  The hood will decrease chances of lens flare and increase metering accuracy. If you use filters, Canon recommends against stacking.The Canon EF 28-135mm lens is similar in build a little shorter and weighs a couple ounces less.  Of course the Canon EF 28-135mm has a wider focal range.  Both lenses have single mode IS capabilities, and are good walkabout lenses.  Having used the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L the difference in weight and length is hardly noticeable.  The shorter focal distance is not missed, and I have a constant f/4 through out the focal scale unlike the Canon EF 28-135mm with a 5.6-36 on the long focal range.  The images using the Canon EF 24-105mm IS f/4L is sharper and clearer than those using the Canon EF 28-135mm.If the Canon EF 24-105mm f/4.0L IS lens' price is not a problem, this is the lens to get. Otherwise purchase and enjoy the28-135mm IS lens.  The great thing about Canon lenses is they tend to hold their value.  If you want to upgrade from the 28-135mm, sell it on a popular auction site like I did.PROS:A compact L standard IS zoom that is an excellent walkabout lens.Versatile multipurpose lensCONS:A price typically found on L lensesMay become your most used lens ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(4138, 4152)"

The CD helps.UPDATE - 4/08/2013: This router made me think of that old saying: ""You get what you pay for."" The Wifi signal eventually got worse for me and this router.  It didn't matter which channel I flipped it to or where I placed it in my home.  It got to the point where if I didn't have a clear line of sight of the router, I was bound to lose signal.

This router is great if you want a decent Wifi signal in a small studio apartment.

However the drive refuses to recognize on reboot - I have to disconnect the USB cable and reconnect.

I actually bought 3 monitors because I am running SLI configuration for programming and for gaming. Because I have such a small desk, at the moment, I had to angle the monitors 75 degrees from the center monitor.  So if you can picture that in your mind, I want to say I have NO problem seeing anything. The colors still look great and gaming is just as fun. Only problem (this is not the monitors fault) is my head hurts from turning lol, just wanted to share that :PSome might ask if the 21 inch is too small. I can say I was worried about this too because I was using my PS3 3d display beforehand and can say that text is a fraction of a bit smaller. Unless you have really bad eyes, these monitors are perfect size. I also like the size because I have heard the bigger you go, the more you can see the LED backlight. In my case I can say on a totally black screen I see MINOR backlighting; nothing that would make the screen look awful, don't let that turn you away from the monitor.Some reviewers have had bad outcomes with dead pixels and what not, I bought 3. Not one of them has had any problem except for user error. This user error was I thought all 3 monitors were dead because when I ""touched"" the power button it didn't respond. Don't fall victim like I did, the power button is under the screen, it is not a fancy touch sensitive button like I thought, again user error. You have plenty of connection options except display port but that is alright because I prefer DVI and HDMI so it really is user preference. No speakers but again doesn't bother me, I use a headset. Lastly, the design is sleek but the stand feels cheap. Just touching the monitor a little and you will notice a bouncing effect (monitor rocks back and forth). This could have been made better but I don't plan on moving them or touching them so not a big deal breaker.So overall I am very happy with the purchase. The picture looks great at all angles, the frame rate if perfect (even for hardcore gaming, tested BF3 with ultra-settings, SLI 670s, and all three monitors in surround mode and it was PERFECT/BREATHTAKING), and the price couldn't be any more appealing for IPS.

I've been using this specific brand of headphones for about 12 years now, and I refuse to buy another brand or style.It started about 25 years ago, when I was living with my parents, and I had a pair of headphones that I absolutely LOVED! About 10 or so years ago, I wanted to try and find another pair just like them, so I went searching.I finally realized that the pair I used when I was younger were called Porta-Pro, also made by Koss. However, those are a little more expensive and I didn't really like the way they felt on my head. Maybe it's my big head, but they just felt too tight. So, somebody recommended these, and I just fell in love with them.The are very comfortable - even for my big head. It's almost like you're not even wearing headphones. I like the design, and the soft, blue material on top is comfortable resting on your head. Also, the volume control is very convenient. I always use it as opposed to the volume on my MP3 player or computer now.The only negative is that - since they are so inexpensive - they are made of cheaper materials, and my two boys (ages 9 and 11) have torn up a few. Usually, the jack gets shorted out and one, or both, of the speakers stop working. This could easily be fixed with some solder and an iron, but since they're so cheap, I usually just buy another pair. Also, the pads tend to wear down over time, but that's to be expected. You can purchase an extra set of pads as a backup, which I did.As for the sound? It's great. There is a lot of bass response in the phones, and the volume can get pretty loud. The sound is also very clear, and I would compare the audio quality to $100 headphones I've owned in the past.I highly recommend the KTX-Pro1 headphones by Koss.

I figured I'd order the 880 from Amazon, see if it worked. If it didn't, I'd send it back within the 30 days and order the ""One"".The 880 is great! I received it, logged on, set it up with all my components (Sony 52"" XBR4 LCD TV, Sony STR-DA5200ES receiver, DirecTv HR-20 HD DVR/Receiver, XBox 360 w/HD DVD drive (by the way, during the setup, the website asked me if my XBox 360 was standalone or had the HD-DVD drive as well--a real surprise), and a couple of other VCR/DVD/CD players/recorders), and have been having fun tweaking it the past 2 days. I did not experience any of the difficulties described in some of the other reviews. It sits in the cradle perfectly. The buttons are smaller than some remotes, but it makes it easy to reach most of them with my thumb holding it in one hand. I'm a big guy with a big hand. I don't like the numbers on the bottom, but something has to be on the bottom, and I use the numbers less often than the volume, channel up/down, mute, previous, joystick and transport keys.Before I ordered it, I wondered if it would have all the keys for my DVR without going through a hierarchy of menus. It has everything right on top, even a ""List"" soft button on the LCD readout when in ""Watch DirecTv"" activity. Pushing ""List"" shows me the programs I've recorded, and using the joystick allows me to select or delete just as the DirecTv remote does. Perfect.You can change the ""Activity"" names, such as from the default ""Watch PVR"" to ""Watch DirecTv""; you can do away with cute icons behind each activity if it seems cluttery; in short, it's doing its job.I will keep the original remotes available for some of the really esoteric commands I might use occasionally. The 880 probably will do all those things through its menus, but I use them so seldom that it just isn't an issue.And my wife loves it!! ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2709, 2723)"

B0074BW614,electronics,How is the price?,"My first tablet was a touchpad, sadly Web OS had very good promise but it was a total lag fest. I rooted and then installed the android operating system; it kind of liberated the tablet. It was more responsive, but development of the community was slow because the touchpad was not that popular. Reading on the tablet was really good, but forget about reading in your bed this thing was heavy.  So I decided to sell the HP touchpad. Decided that I was either going to go for the kindle fire HD or nexus 7. I looked at both devices and I was impressed with the performance of both. But the nexus 7 was king in performance.  But what I really disliked was the screen and the storage space of the nexus 7.  So I knew I was going to use the tablet to the maximum so I went with the kindle fire hd because it offered more space. As it is now I only have 6.78 GB left after everything I have done to the tablet.Kindle fire HD ""7"" The reason why I rooted===================================I ended up rooting my kindle fire.  There are tutorials on YouTube and xda developers.  I always like rooting the cell phones and tablets I get my hands on. My hd2 was rooted so many times (rip hd2 best cell phone ever). If could I would root my ti-89 titanium.  So I could not resist myself I had to root my KFHD. Its good feeling that the community is there to help expand the horizons of the product you paid money for. That's the main reason I did not go for the ipad 3. There just so much you can do with the android platform.  There were a lot of apps missing from the kindle store so I had to root the KFHD.Performance=====================The KFHD is pretty snappy, fast I would say.  Sometimes scrolling through the carousel it stutters.  But for the majority of time it's really good. The silk browser is a total lag fest.  So just installed the dolphin browser and wow now that's fast.  Smooth scrolling and pinch to zoom in.It takes a few seconds for the YouTube app to load completely. Also Google maps takes a few seconds to locate your position. When I mean a few seconds like 10 seconds or less. I am not sure why this is happening.  After loading everything is fine.I put some movies files avi and they played fine. They played really nice with dice player.N64oid works really good on the kindle fire hd. Mario kart 64 and ps3 controller work beautifully on kindle fire HD.  Gaming overall is great on the kindle fire hd. I was playing dead trigger and I did not see any frame drop and overall enjoyable game. played mass effect infiltrator, asphalt 7 ($.99), shadowgun, and they were running fine. i will try later FPSE see how that goes.Display=======================I like the display colors pop and I like reading a lot on the screen. There is a lot of reflection with sun light so that kind of spoils the fun.  The movies look great on the display no problems here. Also games look really nice on the kindle fire hd. Overall I like the display.Holding volume down + power button at the same time takes a picture of your display.I kind of like the carousel but If could I would want my apps to just show on the main screen like normal android.  I just don't see the point to carousel.  But whatever the case adw launcher ex  is always there.Battery========================The battery last a long time.  I did not mind that they gave us a mini usb cable for the for the kindle fire hd. I used by hd2 charger for the kindle fire it charges fine and fast enough for me.  Why can't customers have the choice to change their own battery? The hp was like this, also the nexus 7.  Why are they copying apple?Sound=================Wow sound is legit on this device. Really loud. Overall really impressed on the sound. Headphone is really good too. Sound is not a problem. 5 stars.  No much to say other than amazon did it right.Camera================Camera is ok , its just whatever.  It nice that it is there. I downloaded from android market camera ics and you can take pictures and videos from the app.  Can control zoom in functions with the apps, also share via Bluetooth, and email via Gmail.Bluetooth================It limited to what it can connect. I could not connected to my ps3 Bluetooth headset.  I could not make it connect to my computer which had a Bluetooth usb. So I guess I ll need to find some devices and meeting the requirements of the KFHD7.Ads==========Ads don't bother me, but I wish they were maybe related to what I liked. But If I feel like they are in my way, since I am already rooted then I remove them manually. Was actually really funny I was showing off my kindle fire hd to someone, and as soon as I turned the kindle there was big titanic advertisement as my lock screen picture, so it was really awkward, I was like uhhhh  yeah I don't like titanic.  Maybe some gamer advertisements would be nice. Xbox 360 or ps3 gaming advertisements.Apps that work after rooting=============================Youtube  v4.1.23Gmail  v4.1.2Google earth 7.0.0.7386Google maps v6.12.0Google talkGroove ip liteCamera icsAutocad ws (looked really good on the kindle fire hd) for any engineers out thereDead trigger ( can play now with ps3 controller)Graph 89 free (like having a ti 89 titanium  but with color )Mass effect infiltratorShadow gun ( can play now with ps3 controller)N64oid (nintendo 64 emulator ( can play now with ps3 controller))Sixaxis controller now I can use my ps3 controller with kindle fire hdDice player to watch avi movies.Adw launcher ex works but if you hit home button it reverts back to the carouselAny app you can think of from the android storeOverall===========All I can say is that I like my kindle fire hd.  I really like that I put some physics books, math books, engineering books, carry them all and read on that nice display. I can then use an app like graph 89 and upload ti 89 titanium operating system on app, it kind of replaces my actual ti 89 titanium. I load some games and so far I like playing games with my ps3 controller. i watched rango, true grid, iron man 2, defiance, mission impossible, and all can say is I like the display and the sound. The performance is great but not perfect. Bluetooth left something to be desired. Rooting the device opens a lot of doors.  I would recommend the device; I would rate it over all 4 stars.  You get a free month of amazon prime.  I think I ll get the amazon prime membership was using my brother one.other notes============as jsh1120 pointed out rooting the device does void your warranty unless you can revert (in some cases you can). please research before doing anything. the youtube tutorial is fairly simple to follow, but if you have never rooted a device before this might be challenging.****Rooting the device will NOT kill your amazon prime instant video streaming capabilities******* amazon prime video streaming is working fine after rooting, i am watching my free movies just fine.update 10/6/2012=================i bought a mini hdmi to hdmi, the kindle fire hd looks really good on the tv, it amazing, i was able to play some n64 games with the ps3 controller in the big tv. brought some nostalgia memories.search youtube ""kindle fire hd Rooted with google apps"" i uploaded this video showing what kindle can do, please note is laggy because i was recording through vnc, and i had no camera.

B004XZL980,electronics,What is the price of the display?,"UPDATE - 6/27/11 -I did get a software update a while back for the A500, and it did fix the screen waking up, this made it so that the battery will now last for a couple of days of light use before it runs out, compared to being plugged in everyday like it was before when the screen would wake up for notifications.I haven't really noticed any other large changes from the previous version.  On the other hand, I did see that a leaked version of the 3.1 upgrade is out on the web today, so we should be getting that upgrade soon, and it sounds like a lot of enhancements are in that update.One other thing of note, is that I picked up a wireless usb keyboard for use with the A500, and it worked fine for me, but my wife was trying to use it with blogger and she said she was having problems with it.  Seems like it couldn't quite keep up with her typing.  It doesn't seem to be the keyboard but the A500 that was the limiting factor, because I used the keyboard on a normal laptop, and didn't notice any lag.I still really like using the A500 over having to use a normal laptop like I was before, it is just so much nicer that it is always on and I can just hit the power button and go!  Still very happy with this purchase.END UPDATE**********************I bought this the week it showed up in a brick and mortar store near me.  I love having a tablet around, it is much quick to just pick it up and use it instead of having to wake up/start up my computer.  I use this for most of my web browsing now when I am at home, and I also take the tablet to work and use it for music via bluetooth (works perfectly with my sony DR-BT50 headphones).HDMII have also purchased an hdmi cable for the tablet and that works awesome.  When you plug in the hdmi cable, it will automatically start mirroring the display, and the sound worked through the TV speakers as expected.  I have noticed that since the resolution on the A500 is 1280x800 it cuts off part of the top and bottom when it is connected to my tv, which runs it at 720p (1280x720).  This is a minor annoyance because I was able to share videos and other content quickly and easily with the tablet, where as with my laptop, it never seems to work as nice.Sound & DisplayThe sound on the tablet is really good, I was kind of surprised, for such a small thing to have such good sound.  I am not saying I would want to listen to my music over the speakers, my headphones are much better for that, but for sharing music or videos with people around it works pretty well.  The display is fine, good, but not great.  I think the colors and brightness are fine, but my phone seems better (Galaxy S phone).  The viewing angle is good, and easily sharable with a person sitting next to you.Apps & SoftwareI really like Honeycomb (Android 3), the G-mail client is much better.  The browser is fine, but it is a little on the sluggish side.  I planned on using this to replace a laptop for surfing the web while moving around the house, and it is good for that, but I can tell that the browser is just not as fast as the laptop on the same network, so I think it might be a little underpowered by comparison.  Most sites load with the full site and not a mobile site (wired for some reason always gives me the mobile... grrrr), and that makes it a much better experience.  The on-screen keyboard is ok, I am so used to using swype on my phone, that I miss it when using the A500, but I haven't tried to install it yet.  As for the other apps in the android market, I have loaded a bunch of the non-tablet apps, and they seem to work fine for me.  Most of them scale great (including angry birds, which is huge on a 10.1"" screen).  I have also picked up a few tablet only versions, and they worked just as well.HardwareOverall the tablet seems zippy, I haven't noticed any slowdowns when running regularly, though I did get choppy video when trying to use a 720p video on You Tube while connected to HDMI.  I haven't tried that again, but I have a feeling it just was too much for the tablet.  Anyway I love that it has the HDMI port, and the USB micro in for transferring data over, and a normal usb for a keyboard, or flash drives.WIFIThe wifi works just ok, the signal strength doesn't seem as good as a normal laptop, but it is about the same or possibly a little better than my Galaxy S phone.  I have also had times where sitting 10 feet from the router I kept loosing the signal, but after a reboot, it seemed to work fine.  I have also wifi tethered the A500 to my phone, and that worked out great.  Basically you just turn on wifi-tether on the phone, and the A500 saw it as an access point right away.  The only bad part is that it does suck the phone's battery very quickly.  I did this while out camping (sadly only getting E :( and not 3G), and it made the trip a lot nicer than trying to use my phone like I had in the past for e-mail and catching up in reader.Now for the downers....So I mentioned that there were a couple of problems, and they will probably all be fixed via software updates.  First off I had a heck of a time using the market when I first purchased the A500.  It would get stuck when it was suppose to download something.  I finally did a wipe of the data (fresh install again), and I had the same problem.  I realized that I had clicked on the update for google maps when it first loaded up, and after another wipe, I went to the market first, and had to accept the agreement, and then everything worked fine.  So, click on the Market icon first and accept the terms.*FIXED* -- Another thing that is annoying is that the screen keeps popping on when the tablet is not in use.  I was reading on some of the forums, that if you turn off wifi, or put the tablet in airplane mode, that it would stop doing this.  It seems to be that when it tries to do data updates in the background, it turns the screen on.  This is a minor annoyance, but it keeps the screen waking up, and it sucks battery.I have also had a one lockup that I had to hold down the power button till it turned off, and then turned it back on.  And once where the browser wouldn't load anything after clicking on a link in the google reader app.  I had to reboot the table to get this fixed.OverallI really like the tablet, and I think the issues I had above, will all be fixed by software updates as honeycomb becomes more mature.  I had a G1 when it first came out, and it was pretty much a mess when at the beginning.  As the software updates came along, it worked much better.  Using the tablet as a replacement for a laptop, works pretty good for surfing the web, and watching videos and such, though it could use more power in the browser area.  The battery life is better than my phone, but that just isn't saying much.  I really like the options that it presented (like the USB and HDMI ports), and the screen resolution, which is why I purchased this over the Asus transformer (need the dock for a normal usb port), and it was much cheaper than the Xoom(Verizon or WIFI) or G-Slate (T-Mobile), or the iPad2.  I also was more interested in an Android tablet over an iOS tablet, because I use a lot of Google services (GMail, Docs, Calendar, Reader, etc), and they work better on Android than they seem to on iOS, so it is much more convenient for me.  I bet within 3-6 months I will have to upgrade this to a 5 star review, but with the software problems as they are now, I just can't do it, even though I wouldn't get rid of the A500.

B005HMO6A6,electronics,What should be done with the stands?,"Granted it is a fairly inexpensive BT keyboard, but it has one fundamental issue that made it a chore for me--opening the case.  If you look in the product photos,you'll see the iPad part connects on a swivel through what is essentially a camera lens cap.  That part is ok and secure,except the camera lens cap part is on a very loose hinge itself.  The main hinge, however, is very stiff.  So, you have to use a fair amount of force to open the case.  Once you get it about 30 degrees or so open, you have to switch your grip.  If you don't, the weak camera lens cap hinge comes into play,and all the force you were putting on the stiff main hinge moves to the no resistance camera lens cap hinge.  More than a few times it would suddenly flip open on me, causing me to nearly drop my iPad.  Not cool.  I also started to experience some other issues, like the keyboard was doubling some letters--like the letter &#34;E&#34;. Talk about the worst letter to double every 4/5 times you type it...Another issue is adjusting the view angle.  The iPad holder part has a ratcheting mechanism that locks the screen at a set distance from the keyboard.  Problem is, it ratchets going out.  Which means any time you what to adjust the angle, the ratchet part offers no resistance and the screen just slides right over the top of the keyboard.  Any adjustments become two handed, one to mess with the stiff hinge and screen angle, the other to make sure the screen stays at the right distance from the keyboard.Finally, the charge light went on and stayed on.  To me, this was indicative of some serious quality issues, and I wasn't going to hang around and see what failed next. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(1670, 1684)"

B005HMO6A6,electronics,How are the results?,Upon first opening the box I was impressed at the overall look of the case.  It is very slim but at the same time very sturdy case.  The ipad clipped right on and the keyboard connected right away with the bluetooth.  I have only been using the case for about a week now but have very few issues.  The keyboard works great and looks good enough that people don't believe it's not a laptop until I show them.The keyboard itself is fairly light and I carry around my iPad almost full time with the keyboard and use it like my old netbook.  The keys work great and the only issue I've had is due to limited space the right shift key is smaller to make room for the up arrow.  I find myself hitting the up arrow a lot when going for the shift but it is something minor that with continued use is becoming less and less.  The battery life is also great.  I charged the keyboard the recommended 6 hours when I got it and I have not had to charge it yet (5 days as I use it to write this).The mount for the iPad itself is pretty simple and connect by simply squeezing together the tabs.  The biggest issue I have with the mount is the option to slide it in and out.  You have to slide the lock to move it out (move iPad away from you) but it slides in without the lock.  If you have it out and push or move the keyboard it has a tendency to move all the way back in.  Tilting back and forth is semi difficult also but that may be it is fairly new and will loosen up a bit with continued use.My only other con is a personal preference due to the fact I'm a pilot and use the iPad in the cockpit so it may not apply to you.  When I take the iPad off the keyboard before the flight I now have to find a place to safely store the keyboard.  It is rugged but I don't want to just throw it in my flight back and have items pressing on the keys.I have not tried it yet but it does appear the top case is actually thin enough to fit into other cases to be used as a pilot kneeboard.Overall I am very satisfied with this case.  I don't think you will find another hard case or keyboard combo that will compete with the NT38B anywhere near the price range.  I highly recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND,ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2164, 2178)"

I don't have a netflix account neither i use google video&music.; I watch some youtubes but those are short clips. I do watch amazon prime videos but no chromecast apps are available for that. Still, as you know, these is a way though.When you set up your chromecast, wifi connection is required even if you are using the wired lan cable. Here is the point.WIFI IS NOT REQUIRED AFTER THE INITIAL SETUP.The reason casting your chrome browser lags is this. When casting youtube, it's pretty much the dongle that is doing most of the job. That's why it works great. However, when you casting your browser, two way traffics are going on. That's why it lags. Most wireless connections are slower than wired lan. Well some hi-tech wireless would certainly beat wired but that's not for many of us. Then, if we can make at least one way faster, we can assume that casting with your browser would be much better.(I assume you know how to do it. 1)Get the chrome browser for PC 2) download the extension named as google cast 3) put folder's path on the browser 4) browse and run the file 5) click the extension on the right top and cast 6)if you are just casting the screen of your chrome then you don't need 3)and4))Okay, once I set up, I took off my wifi usb adapter for my desktop and connect it with lan cable. Nothing fancy, just a simple cat5e cable. Do I have an expensive router? No way. Mine is refurbished Cisco Valet M20. Got it less than $20.My computer is a bit high-tech. But I assume it doesn't matter since my laptop returned the same result.The difference is huge. With two-way WIFI, I can't even make it with high 720p option on the chrome browser. The amazon video lags so bad that I had to set it to 480p. Playing local video files was worse. I played 2 gb 720p mkv file just FYI.With wired and WIFI, it works great. I would say it's 90% perfect. With wired cable, I can set it to extreme 720p and it still works great. NO lags whatsoever. amazon prime videos or local media files. Since I don't have 1080p files in my HDD, I couldn't test it. However, 720p mkv file worked just great. This means ANY STREAMING on your PC chrome will cast to your tv with the dongle without lagging. hulu, hbo, vemeo.. you just name it.I know the chromcast app on your PC will still ask for wifi connection. However, it works without it as long as you are connected to the same router.Well, hope this helps for those non-netflix users but still thinking about buying this.

B003VAM32E,electronics,What do you think about grip?,"The Logitech G700 gaming mouse is by far one of the most desirable mice I have ever owned. I had upgraded from a 6 year old Logitech Performance Lazer mouse, which still works for the most part, but some of the buttons are hit and miss. A lot of the functionality and the like for the G700 have already been reviewed in the comments so I won't bore you with repeated like to like reviews. What I will be focusing on is it's battery life in fine detail.The Logitech G700 comes with a 1.2v AA 1,900 mAh eneloop brand rechargeable battery. It is rated, according to the manual and double checked by Logitech support team, that the mouse can function on a full charge with continual use between 8-10 hours of battery life. That's right ladies and gentlemen. A retailed value Logitech mouse of $99 will last you 8-10 hours on a full charge with its included battery. Ridiculous you say? Well you are spot on. One could easily spend $20 bucks on a cheap mouse on any brand and get 2-3 months of battery life. Sure it would not have the Logitech label on it, would not have the 13 programmable buttons and some other fancy stuff but bottom line you would not have to recharge the battery every day, or even every week with a mouse rated to run 2-3 months on a single battery. So lets just come to realization that the battery life on this mouse is extremely awful, probably the worst I have ever seen in the history of wireless mice. While talking to the Logitech support team they stated its comparable, the Logitech MX Performance mouse, lasts up to 30 days on a single charge. Why the HUGE difference in battery life? Well according to the Logitech support team both mice have the exact same rechargeable battery. So again I ask myself why does the G700 only last 8-10 hours on 1 full charge and the MX Performance lasts 30 days on one charge and they both contain the same battery? What is destroying the battery life on the G700? What drains it so quickly? The Logitech support team had no direct response and made the excuse that because the G700 has more buttons and it's a gaming mouse that it drains the battery faster and this answer was from an assistant manager after I got fed up with the international gentlemen who had to look up every question and was hard to understand. I call BS on that answer I really do. So I decided to go out and do some testing...I went out and purchased the Logitech MX Performance mouse so I could compare the two. I also decided to purchase a pack of eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh to see if truly this G700 really has an awful battery life or I just got a bad battery. In theory I should be able to get roughly 4 more hours of battery life with an extra 800 mAh if this battery truly only has a running battery time of 8-10 hours on a single charge using its stock battery giving me an estimated run time of 12-14 hours. After further testing the Logitech MX Revoltuoin triumphs the G700 in battery life by far using the eneloop 1.2v 2700 mAh on both mice. So again the question remains why does the G700 chew and spit out battery life in a matter of hours VS the MX Revolution lasts a full month on a single charge? I did some research and found that gaming mice naturally have a higher polling rate (ping rate) and they just hog battery juice from their internals because they require more power for more precision and less lag time. Plus gaming mice are for the most part are wired, not wireless and there are reasons for that because of the power gaming mice require to function at their best. What does this gibberish polling rate mean? Basically speaking its how many times your G700 talks to your computer. For example if your polling rate is set to 1000Hz then your G700 is updated every 1 millisecond. That means your G700 and your computer talk 1000 times per second. That's a lot of talking which means a heavy load on your battery. However if you change it to the lowest setting for the G700 which is 125Hz then your G700 only updates every 8 milliseconds which is 125 times per second which is a lot less talking which means less battery consumption. What does this all mean to the average user? Well if your not a hardcore gamer where every millisecond counts on your life then your in luck and should be able to get up to a couple days of battery life on a single charge depending on your average usage. Please note the below instructions are for getting the longest battery life out of your G700 and may not be up to snuff with your gaming needs. Here is how to do it...1. When your G700 is NOT in use toggle the On/Off switch underneath it to ""OFF."" This way your G700 is not always trying to ping your computer even if it is not being used.2. Install the Logitech Gaming Software for your G700 from the Logitech website and set some settings. Set the polling rate to 125Hz. This is the best setting for using less battery juice. Also set the ""Advanced"" settings to ""Power Save"" which will put your mouse to sleep quicker when idle resulting in less consumption of battery juice in case you forgot to toggle your On/Off switch.3. Get a better mAh battery. Logitech threw in a common 1,900 mAh battery which is normal but stupid on their part since the gaming mouse beats it's battery to a pulp. Go out and upgrade your battery to a 2,700 mAh battery. For those who don't know mAh is basically the capacity of your battery. In most cases the higher the mAh the more capacity on name brands minus some fine fine details. However If you go and buy a higher mAh with Chinese writing all over it on some shady website chances are it's a cheap imitation and like all cheap imitations they are...well cheap and expect them to work half as good or less than a name brand.Because of the below average support from the Logitech support team as well as the lesser capacity battery included where a higher capacity battery was obviously needed I took away 2 stars. I would of taken 3 stars off if I had paid the full retail price but I was able to price match Amazon.com at my local retail store and got it to a more reasonable and comfortable price. I hope my review educated you and most importantly helped you achieve greater battery life then you ever thought possible on your Logitech G700 Gaming Mouse. Thanks for reading!

I feel like it's going to be quite a while before I even need to move videos and photos off of the card to make room for more. I have other Transcend SD cards in smaller sizes and those work great too. The price on this card is definitely better than I could find for other brands of the same size, as well.Update (07/13/12):I found a problem with this card if you're using it in a DSLR for video. I have a Canon T3i and when I shoot video sometimes (well, probably more than half of the time) it will stop recording either within seconds of hitting record or a couple minutes later. I did a search online and what it seems to be is when you go back through your card and delete certain photos or videos that aren't at the end of the sequence it leaves gaps in the memory, then when you record a video it tries to fill those gaps before continuing at the end of the memory card. Basically, I have to save everything to my computer and format my memory card while it's in my camera before doing any video shoots to make sure this doesn't happen. It seems to work fine if I do that. In theory, if you don't delete anything that's not at the end of the number sequence, it should work fine as long as you have room, but I don't always look at each picture and decide whether or not to delete it before taking another. I have read that this isn't an issue with some other brands like San Disk, but haven't tried for myself. I also don't know if this only happens with certain cameras.This is the only problem I've had with this memory card and for everything else, it works great.

Like many guys, I bought this after selling my dSLR gear that was simply too big and heavy to use consistently. I keep this camera out on the table so if my family does something funny or cute, I can take a picture right away. The slow focus, however, is very noticeable and I am beginning to not trust the camera to do what I want it to do.An upcoming vacation will be the real test, including taking some family portraits for friends. If it fails or gives me softly-focused shots at that time, I will be very disappointed and will likely start looking fondly back at my Nikon, which was always lightning-fast and focused spot-on.

B00DR0PDNE,electronics,When was that video recorded?,"For reference, this is my setup:Time Warner Cable in Austin, Texas with gamer speed, on really old shared wiring that is so bad there isn't enough power to get actual cable--I just have cable internet; a MediaLink router; a four-year-old Korean re-branded Viore monitor without a working antenna, but with three HDMI ports; and, a two-year old basic Dell, factory setup laptop.Having said that:  my cable service, despite paying for ""gamer speed"", is pretty shoddy during peak hours.  HuluPlus and Amazon on Demand seem to have packet streaming that deals with that pretty well--I have to restart movies during peak hours, two or three times, but other than that I don't have much interruption.But, I thought this didn't work at all with a two-year-old Dell laptop because it couldn't connect during peak hours.

B0074BW614,electronics,How is the cell phone screen?,"Don't get me wrong, I love my e-ink kindle to death. It's served me well these past few years, but getting a Kindle Fire HD has opened up a bigger world of applications.For one thing, I can stream both Netflix and Pandora, which helps me on my personal and professional side projects quite a bit (I co-host several podcasts and radio shows based on entertainment like movies, books, and television).For another, I can finally take advantage of the electronic delivery of graphic novels, I feature I really love now that I've upgraded. The interface takes a few tries to get used to, as I'm a newbie to touchscreen interfaces, but it's pretty intuitive.It's also nice to have access to all of those casual gaming apps that most folks get on their smartphones. While Angry Birds has a somewhat limited appeal to me (I only got the Star Wars version), I'm really addicted to the Perry the Platypus game and look forward to trying out the Plants vs. Zombies port (I have the PC version and want to try out the tablet one).Now, I do have a few complaints, but none of them are big enough to drop it down from 5 stars.First, sometimes the typing interface and autocorrect can be glitchy. I'm sure there's a way to turn the latter off and I haven't had much trouble with the keypad since that first day. Maybe it just needed to map my finger size, I don't know.Second, the wifi can be a little bit of a pain when connecting to certain networks. When I'm at home on my own wireless, there's no issue, but when I'm at work, it's constantly dropping off the network and I have to redo the login procedure. Now, that's probably my work ISP's fault, but it would be nice if there were a way for the kindle to save that info so I didn't have to reenter it each time.Third, is an overall kindle catalog complaint... there just aren't any manga titles that I want to purchase for the Fire. It seems like the entire available catalog of manga for kindle is Yaoi. Nothing against the genre, but I want titles like Yotsuba and Emma and Dance in the Vampire Bund on my kindle, not just boy-love titles that have no appeal to me.Still, overall, I am VERY happy with my Kindle Fire...

Getting my browser to work with it took a little more fiddling, but that's just because I didn't want my work email associated with my youtube etc... nevermind. Anyway, Chromecast works basically as promised. It's sort of neat that I can pull up a youtube video on my phone or tablet or computer and get it playing on my big screen.It was apparent right away though that the image was cropped on my screen. I'm running a 1080p stream to a 1080p screen, and don't have this issue with my PS3, Xbox, Blu Ray player, or Boxee or Roku. I streamed my screen as well, and sure enough it wasn't a true representation of my laptop screen. Didn't matter what I streamed from either - I tried doing so from my phone, and the youtube video was cropped on all sides - looked zoomed in. I played around with my tv settings, and it didn't fix the issue. There's no settings to be found for fixing it either.Even zoomed in, it was a nice quick way to send youtube to my tv (even though I have other methods) - it's easily the fastest way considering the time it takes to fire up other devices. Hulu was also zoomed in, and the performance was choppy. I noticed I had to have the video playing in my laptop at the same time and I couldn't close the lid on my laptop. If I went full screen, Hulu would show full screen on my tv, but I couldn't do anything else with my laptop. The video on my laptop was not synced with the video on the screen. So if I want to watch hulu and do other stuff with my laptop, I have to watch it in the browser window which you can see on the tv screen rather than full screen. Full screen crops the video anyway though like I said, so there's really no good way to watch hulu I don't think. Unless I'm missing something.Netflix had the same issue as Hulu with the cropping and full screen. Youtube didn't have the full screen issue where I couldn't do anything else with my laptop... just the cropping.This is a decent little device for the price, but I probably won't use it for much besides youtube streaming. I'd say for what it costs, if you plan to only use it to stream Youtube, it's worth the money. Otherwise, save your hdmi port for something better. If I had a time machine, I would probably not buy it again since I don't really need it. In fact, I may relegate it to the bedroom tv that never really gets used. I'm going to hang on to it though to see if they release updates for it that make it better. So far, a pretty &#34;meh&#34; experience. ANSWERNOTFOUND",ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(2563, 2577)"
B00CL8F98W,electronics,How about view?,"Purchased one of these from a big-box store after considerable research comparing it to Dropcam, Foscam, and TRENDNet.  For the past two years we've been using a VueZone system, but recently upgraded to a 10Mb Internet connection so wanted to try a full-frame-rate IP camera with pan, tilt, and zoom capabilities.  The results were disappointing across the board:1. Poor depth-of-field.2. Smeared look to movement.3. Weak Wi-Fi reception.4. Slow response to pan, tilt, and zoom controls.5. Non-existent Tech Support6. Java requirement.Depth-of-Field--------------The image looked fuzzy at certain distances, so I placed it at the end of a 20' hallway and systematically adjusted the lens to find a focal point that would work for all distances near and far.  Never could.  Interestingly, our VueZone camera whose lens is non-adjustable has no difficulty keeping everything in focus.Smeared Movement----------------Compared to YouTube examples--and an understanding of how 30fps should look--our results disappointed.  They were certainly an improvement over the 4fps of our VueZone cameras, but not what 30fps should look like IMHO.  Looked somewhere between those two numbers.Weak Wi-Fi----------One of the big selling points of today's IP cameras is their use of Wi-Fi.  Surprisingly, this camera would not connect much beyond 15' and passing through one wall.  Found this surprising because our VueZone cameras sit 20' feet away and pass through two walls without problem.  One camera is 30' away and passes through three walls one of which is brick.  All the more surprising when you consider the DCS-5020L can act as a wireless extender.Slow Response-------------Pan, tilt, and zoom controls had a 2-4 second delay.  That's not horrible but borders on it.  Again, does not match what people post in YouTube reviews.Tech Support------------DLink has enjoyed a strong reputation for consumer tech products ever since its early success in routers.  So, I was surprised to learn their technical support consisted of FAQ pages on their web site.And, if you click on Contact Us you are taken to a content-management system where you type in your question and it does it's best to find an answer other owners have rated as ""helpful"" in the past.Pretty lame.  Again, using VueZone as our point of reference, at least with them you can call and talk to a person.Java Requirement----------------Simply put, if you use the myDlink web site to access your camera you gotta have Java enabled.  And, since 2011 Java is known to be one of the biggest malware vectors on the Net.  Apple quit shipping products with it pre-installed right after that announcement.Conclusion----------On the plus side, the camera is attractively designed, quiet when tilted or panned, and incorporates an IR-cut filter.  Unfortunately it fails in the critical areas of providing a clear image with reasonable Wi-Fi range.  For that and the reasons outlined above, it will be returned for a refund.  Next stop, Dropcam.
