B003VAGXWK,solid,How are the keys of the  keyboard?,"I was reluctant to try a wireless keyboard, but due to a wire-chomping kitty, decided it was best to go wireless. I'm so glad I did. This keyboard is sleek and stylish. It has a great feel under my fingertips. I was concerned that a wireless keyboard would be &#34;buggy&#34; and not be efficient, but this keyboard is as good as any corded keyboard. It charges easily via USB port and holds a charge for about ten days. The illuminated keys are helpful, if, like me, your eyes aren't as young as they once were. I already had the logitech unifying plug that plugs into my computer for my mouse and touchpad. I turned the keyboard on and the Logitech plug recognized it right away. I highly recommend this keyboard. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The illuminated keys are helpful,"(421, 453)"
B008UHK3KM,fine,How is the product?,"The anti-glare function does work as described. However, it sacrifices the clarity of the screen display and I can't even recognize that my iPad actually has retina display. The screen looks as if it's filled with red, green and blue dots...I'm thinking about replacing the current screen protector with a clear one.---Edited:Now that I've seen what an anti-glare screen protector is like, I realize the clear one is indeed what I need. TechArmor has a great customer service and has kindly provided me with a change to try the clear screen protectors instead of the anti-glare ones. I'm seeing myself as a returning customer. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The anti - glare function does work as described,"(0, 46)"
B006ZBWV0K,good,How is the cover?,"I was pleased to see the Verso Prologue Cover coming in for review. I rely heavily on my Kindle Fire, which the product does not support, but my wife did not have a nice cover for her Kindle 3G.  She still doesn't.  This product does not fit the 3G Kindle. The initial pitch line for the product said it worked on Kindles, but the product page more clearly identifies it as only for Paperwhite, standard Kindle, and Kindle Touch. A disappointment not to be able to test it, but it looks nice. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I was pleased to see the Verso Prologue Cover coming in for review,"(0, 66)"
B003VAK1I2,bad,How well does the speaker work for you?,"To those who think these speakers are too quiet, I suggest you check your ""Sound"" settings (in Mac). Go to ""Output"" and check whether ""Logitech"" is selected, or internal speakers. I'm sure Windows instructions are similar -- Control Panel, Sound, something.If that doesn't work, turn your hearing aid up.This thing is incredibly designed, they should win an award for it. I think it was designed around the 13"" Macbook Pro (that's what I have). It nails at least 7 of Dieter Rams' 10 Principles of design, most especially ""Good design is unobtrusive.""My only complaint is that the sound mix is a little mid-heavy for my taste. That's pretty nitpicking for $40 speakers that hang like a ninja behind my laptop monitor, but I thought I'd share that observation as well. ANSWERNOTFOUND",speakers are too quiet,"(25, 47)"
B006QB1RPY,better,How is the speed?,"I am NOT a computer nerd. Now I can tell you that I just installed this and then updated my wifi devices back to my printer. The whole darn thing took maybe an hour. AND I didn't have to call ANYONE in India (or some other place where I can't communicate with them because we speak different languages). HUZZAH!!! It's up and running and while I don't think I have faster speeds (I'm on satellite--sigh) I was losing my connection when I was in my studio, so today I'll be trying that out. I'll update this review. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I have faster speeds,"(358, 378)"
B004E10KFG,awesome,How is the sound?,"There are many times when I just want my background music to follow me to the patio, on the road, in the kitchen, at meetings -- even at the beach. We used to cart around jam boxes with mix tapes, but now our computers, smart phones, tablets and just about any internet connected device can access our online music library. The speakers on these devices are just horrible and sometimes, I don't want to have headphones on. I wanted a nice sounding small unit that would allow me to enjoy music anywhere from just about any device.The JAMBOX is small, easy to use, sounds very good for background music, is an excellent design and even runs on batteries.SIZE: this thing is very small, you can take it anywhere and tuck it away in a place where it almost disappears. All you get is music.DESIGN: These folks included a simple interface that uses only four buttons and voice feedback to tell you how to pair a device, charging status and much more. It comes with a manual, but honestly, you can set this up with no trouble out of the box. It is well constructed with a nice feel. It even looks good.BLUETOOTH CALLING: The bluetooth implementation works for sound and as a speakerphone. I was not purchasing this as a speakerphone but WOW, this things is great for conferencing as long as everyone is in front of it. Yes it has an integrated microphone. Rejection is very good, we could all clearly hear the caller and they could hear us as well.SOUND: The sound is actually very good for background music. You won't get big stereo sound field, excellent imaging, thumping bass or dance party volume levels -- but what you do get is actually quite impressive. The sound is balanced from top to bottom and is actually very natural. Acoustic music with vocals like James Taylor, Nora Jones or Shane Jackman are reproduced with excellent balance and clarity. Electronic pop music can lack the dynamics and extended bass, but the bass you do get is not boomy and sounds very natural. One more thing about the bass, it is actually amazing this little thing puts out as much bass as it does for the size. If you are worried the JAMBOX will not play loud, it will, just not THUMPING loud. Because of the smooth high end and good tonal response, you can listen to this thing for a long time with almost no fatigue.BLUETOOTH MUSIC: As most devices, the BlueTooth audio is not as good as if you use the 1/8 audio jack. If you want the best sound plug your phone or computer into this thing. It will amaze you. You may need to turn your headphone output down some so as not to overdrive the unit. It will get a little distorted. The BlueTooth sound is very good, just not as good as when using the plug. Jawbone does something very interesting with the BlueTooth audio. Some devices with BlueTooth audio can be overdriven with the audio output from the source and will distort in at the higher levels. I play guitar and some distortion is good, but not on prerecorded music. NO! The folks at JamBox know then and use something called compression to dynamically limit the amount of sound from your device to the JAMBOX when your BlueTooth level is to high. This compression can sound like 70's pop radio where all the dynamics form the music are taken out. if this bothers you, turn your device (phone/iPod/computer) BlueTooth volume down until the compression is eliminated then use the volume on the JAMBOX to adjust the sound. BUGE IMPROVEMENT.In summary, of the BT Speakers out, this one is the best value for me. Smaller than the Bose, sounds about as good, super easy to use and has MUCH better sound than the sub $100 solutions. If Steve Jobs were to design a BlueTooth portable music device, it would look like the JAMBOX. ANSWERNOTFOUND",SOUND : The sound is actually very good for background music,"(1443, 1502)"
B002WE6D44,outstanding,How is the price?,I have a Sony a33 SLT camera and I've used a 32Gig one of these for about 2 years and have not had any problems with it. I just bought a second one because my wife bought a camera that uses one of these cards and I think a 32GB card is good enough to have for a good 2-week vacation without need to remove/delete pics. Not to mention that the price is amazing. ANSWERNOTFOUND,the price is amazing,"(339, 359)"
B00COYOAYW,bad,Why is the camera of poor quality?,"Item like The picture, fast deliver 3 days well packed, good Quality for the price .  phone is really lightweight and looks decent. Though I am not too happy about the white backside.The screen is sharp, bright, and colorful. This Nokia runs Windows that is really intuitive and easy to use even for a person (like me) who never had a smartphone before. The phone feels very fast and responsive. The menus look pretty. You can choose color and content of your home screen as well as size, color, and location of the icons. Also, I chosen Bing background (beautiful landscapes that update every day or two) for the lock-screen and like it a lot. WiFi works great. It connects to my home or work network instantaneously. So, the only time I use my cellular data is when I travel to/from work. The camera is decent (as phone cameras go), There is no flash though. ANSWERNOTFOUND",There is no flash,"(835, 852)"
B003ZSHNGS,new,How is feature?,"I love this camera.  The S95 is my new everyday walking-around camera, replacing my Canon G10 (and very briefly a Nikon P7000).  The S95 produces images of wonderful quality with good noise control (for a 1/1.7 sensor camera) all the way to ISO 2000.  Operation of the menus and controls is very fast with little to no delay in selecting menu options.  The customizable front control ring allows you to quickly change frequently used settings.  Battery life could be better, but I'm getting a little more than the advertised 200 shots per charge, and the battery is small and light enough that it's easy to carry a couple of spares. ANSWERNOTFOUND",  Operation of the menus and controls,"(250, 287)"
B0044YU60M,easy to set,How did you like the router?,"I am a professional writer, focusing on computer-related products, so I don't give 5 star reviews so easily. This product however definitely deserves it.The router took about 10' to install and has worked like a charm since then. Positioned in the ground floor of the house, it manages to give a strong enough signal to be received at 135 Mbps from the upper floor. And that's from my net-book, which has a quite mediocre network card. My room-mate claims that he has a super high speed, both for downloading and for uploading, from his desktop computer.The router has a fairly easy menu, though it took us a good 7 minutes to configure all the security settings (you can never be too careful these days). Other routers may be better in this aspect. However, this is something you only do once (or twice at most) so it's not a big deal.The bottom line is that this product is not just a good buy, but something you can cherish for a while. I would highly recommend it to any computer user who relies a lot on a wireless network for his/her internet access.One thing that it is a bit bizarre though is that the upload speed is about 3 times higher than the download speed, something that has been observed it two computers in our network. Usually DL speed is significantly lower than UL speed. That's not an issue though, since the important factor is the connection stability, which has exceeded our expectations. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The router took about 10 ' to install and has worked like a charm since then,"(153, 228)"
B00B0TMWTW,easy to press,How is the button easy to press?,"This is a very comfortable mouse! I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a tad big for my hands, which might just be a little smaller than average - but it always seemed to me it is harder for those with larger hands to find mice, so that's probably a good feature. It is still a big improvement! It has nice grip on the thumb side and a nice-feeling semi-rubberized right side (which I wish were a little more grippy). The scroll wheel has a very nice feel and grip. The nano receiver fits into the bottom fairly firmly. Completely plug and play on my MacOS10.8 setup. Tracks and slides nicely, feels quality all over. The DPI changing button is in a nice spot where you won't accidentally hit it, too. Great buy! ANSWERNOTFOUND",The nano receiver fits into the bottom fairly firmly,"(467, 519)"
B001CS7UAM,high,Is the review rating not good ?,"***** Update 4/30/2012  -  Apparently the 3/25 problem with charge and retention was related to the original ""too short"" flaw.  Seeing the tape I used to build up the end had compressed a lot under the camera battery's retention clip, I improved that fix and the charge and retention are back.  After a thousand flash-less test pictures there is power left in the charge from a few weeks ago.  Still One Star for the size flaw, tho ********** Update 3/25/2012  -  Seems to Run Out of Juice Awful Quick. . .Now I question this Brand's Total Charge and/or Retention. I've had better all-round luck with Power2000 *****I bought this extra battery for my Olympus Stylus with high hopes since a different battery from a different ""No Name"" brand works well in my Canon camera.  On arrival the battery looked just like the Olympus original but when I put it in the camera nothing happened.Since rechargable batteries usually arrive with enough charge to at least turn on the equipment, I wondered if the thing was DOA.  I tried charging the battery several times in the camera without success in any way.  Again I figured DOA.For some reason I eventually tried pressing the battery down lightly inside the battery compartment with my finger and turning the camera on.  ...It worked...  And it worked fine every time I tried it.When installed, the battery is a ""hair"" too short to touch the contacts inside the battery compartment.  The original Olympus battery has NO HINT of this problem.  I roughly compared the Olympus and Maximal batteries side by side.  If there is any difference in length it is very small but apparently enough to cause an issue.I imagine the problems with the battery having no power seen here in a few negative reviews could be from a lesser degree of the same issue, where the power connection is flawed during use or charging so one suspects the thing is no good.The work-around is to build up the end of the battery with tape or something, though such a fix could make switching batteries a real pain given the tight clearances in the battery compartment.I decided to exchange the battery and hope the replacement meets the original spec. better.  I'm encouraged by it's vast majority of 4 and 5 Star reviews.  The battery was provided by Amazon and I managed to discover the problem within Amazon's Return Window so at least the return is going smoothly, supposedly with no extra cost to me for shipping the battery back and receiving it's replacement.The replacement arrived and has the same problem.  Using several layers of scotch tape, I built up the battery end where the tiny clip holds it in the camera.  The battery seems to work fine now while still slipping in and out of the camera easily.The package has a Support number to call.  The person I spoke with didn't know of any problems like mine and recommended I return the battery to Amazon AGAIN and ...get this... TRY AN DIFFERENT BRAND.  AND though it also is marketed for other manufacturer's cameras, this replacement is SUPPOSED to be an EXACT match for the Olympus model my camera takes...It even has the same Model Code on the package (LI42B).Subsequently I was looking at replacements for a Canon NB-6L battery and saw many 1 Star ratings for MaximalPower's NB-6L battery noting that the thing was TOO BIG to fit, although otherwise that battery also has a high rating. ANSWERNOTFOUND",4 and 5 Star reviews,"(2211, 2231)"
B001CCLBSA,large,What is the price of the camera?,"This is a good little camera. I thought long and hard before I gave it only three stars. But, despite it being better than any other compact, I still have lots of criticism.The good:The image quality is very strong. Not as good as the DP1/2, but that camera is a disaster in nearly all other regards. With F/2 and and 400 you'll likely get the indoor shot you need. And when that fails, 800 is tolerable. The LX3 is a zippy performer too. While a little slow on the startup, the auto-focus is decently quick (could be better) and the shot to shot performance is quite good. The full-auto mode is good too. Hand the camera over to a novice and he/she will get a good shot. Love the aspect ratio.The meh:The zoom range is a little limited. But I'm not too bothered by it. Other than macro, I can't imagine the manual focus ever being usable. I'd gladly give up some screen real estate for a viewfinder (even an evf). An integrated lens cap would have been a nice touch, as would a wrist strap. It'd be nice if the RAW format were more open. At the time of this review Aperture doesn't support it at all and Lightroom only kinda supports it.The bad:My main complaint is the interface. It's not awful. In fact it's probably better than most compacts. But this camera had so much manual potential, only to be let down my too many darned buttons. The user programable setting are a good example. It has four presets. But only two of them are really useful. The other two require you to turn the dial, hit the select button, navigate down and then confirm; you just missed your shot. I wonder why it would be so difficult to have two or three more dials on the camera to control shutter, aperture and ISO? Instead, we get the worlds tiniest joystick. Again, by the time you've actually changed a setting you probably missed the shot. Also, why is a manual focus that goes around the lens so hard to implement? It's such a wonderful convention that is almost never seen on a compact.The wrap up:I do really like this camera. It's a good RAW shooter with good quality; all in a compact package. But, I hope that Panasonic really concentrates on the fundamentals for the LX4. A viewfinder and a couple of dials or knobs would have made this a four star camera for sure. If they managed to squeeze a larger sensor in too, it would be the best camera of all time.The unrelated:Shame on Amazon for allowing price gouging from their partners. Currently (April/May 2009) the LX3K is quite scarce. I ended up paying a reasonable $50 over MSRP. But during the shortage the camera has been on sale for as much as $750 ($250 over MSRP!). Capitalism, the free market and supply/demand are all good things. But I'm a little offended that Amazon would allow their customers to be bludgeoned by such heavy pricing. Remember, just because someone agrees to be taken advantage of, doesn't make it right to do so. ANSWERNOTFOUND",sale for as much as $ 750,"(2575, 2599)"
B007P4VOWC,better,How is the camera?,"I'm disappointed that the flaws in this, my second Galaxy Tab, are so substantial.  The camera is so bad as to be useless, and watching youtube videos is unacceptable:  if you try to fast forward or rewind, it just freezes.  I hate to say it but my ipad, on the same network, is flawless  by comparison. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The camera is so bad as to be useless,"(84, 121)"
B006GWO5WK,good,Is this phome comes with a charger?,"The charger is very nice, I feel that it should be included free of charge when purchasing the kindle fire, or any kindle product.

B0044YU60M,better,How is the unit?,"EDIT:08/14/11Unfortunately, I've been experiencing some issues with this router.  As far as the computers in my house go, this router seems to work just fine.  No problems connecting anywhere in the house.  My problem is with my iOS devices.  My ipad connects just fine and stays connected while in use, but loses it's connection when idle.  I use an alarm clock app at night that displays the weather.  By the time I wake up in the morning, the weather is no longer available because my connection was dropped.  I have to open my preferences and re-select my network.And that's the least of my problems.  I use my ipad as a VNC Remote, VLC Remote, and a remote file viewer for my Mac Mini.  I had never had any hiccups with my previous router, but this one will not connect with any of those three applications.  If I restart the router, I have a short period of time where they will connect before my ipad goes idle, I lose my connection, re-select my network in preferences, and then none of those three will work.  It's never just one, all three stop working at once.  I use these features of my wifi network multiple times throughout the day and this has been incredibly frustrating.I'm waiting to hear back from tech support before I box this up and send it back.  I really want to like it...it's nice looking, and fast, but I need the above features to work, or the router is near useless to me.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This was an upgrade from a Comcast leased router that, in all honesty, was perfectly fine.  We were just tired of paying for it every month.  I've only had this router for a day, but setup only took seconds.  The setup page is pretty easy to navigate and I had no problems renaming our network, creating a passcode, and forwarding the necessary ports to get my torrent clients up and running.  I don't notice any significant speed increase over a wireless G router, but very few systems are able to utilize the 150mbps this thing is capable of providing.  Anyway, the signal is strong and it's as speedy as expected.I've owned quite a few routers in my day and most of them are pretty straight forward pieces of equipment.  This one receives five stars because it does what it's supposed to and hasn't hickupped so far.  I will update my review in a few months when I have a better idea of durability and quality over time, but I don't foresee any issues.For the price, a GREAT buy, and I highly suggest getting the bundle that Amazon offers with this modem:Motorola SB6120 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 eXtreme Broadband Cable Modem.  The combination is stellar.  Very happy buyer :) ANSWERNOTFOUND",router seems to work just fine,"(127, 157)"
B00DR0PDNE,capable,How do set the device to the most advanced level?,"Setup was painless and took about 5-10 minutes. The backgrounds are really pretty and I had no problem throwing Hulu, Pandora, and Netflix from my Samsung Galaxy S3 to the TV via this Chromecast. It's actually much faster to use than booting up my roommate's 360 or PS4 to watch streaming media.

B00G4UQ6U8,similar,How was the sound?,"I have been extremely pleased with Brainwavz S1 headphones. I have not been very impressed with any of the in-ear headphones I have tried in the past due to lack of comfort and poor sound quality. Brainwavzs has a developed a product that has addressed these areas and offers more.Firstly, the ear buds fit comfortably and don't tug on the ears. After an hour of wearing these headphones, my ears still feel fine.  The company includes several different options for inner ear tips. It is trial and error to find the ones that work for you. Secondly, the sound quality is great for my uses. I tried these on an airplane to watch a movie and during a work out to listen to music. As advertised, the bass and vocals were clear and not overbearing. Though they didn't cancel sound as the bulkier headphones do, but the sounds quality was impressive while on the airplane. To note, I did not try any tips other than the tri-flange tips during the plane trip. Additionally, when the outside of the earbuds are rubbed or brush against something during sound play, the sound is not impacted.Some added features that add to this product are the flat wires that cut back on tangling. This seems to work well. They did not require any untangling when getting them out for use. The hard earphone carrying case is great and small.Overall, this is an excellent product. They offer excellent sounds quality in a compact size and an affordable price. I recommend these for anyone searching for good quality ear buds. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the sound quality is great,"(550, 576)"
B0019EHU8G,comparable,How is the price?,"This 15 ft HDMI cable seems to be well crafted and the price is unbeatable.  I purchased a longer cable to allow for mounting my TV high on a wall with a fully adjustable/movable TV mount.  While I don't have my wall mount yet, I have connected and used the cable and I expect it to work quite well.  It is supple, easy to work with and the Picture quality is great with my 50"" Panasonic plasma TV.  The length of the cable did not degrade picture quality.  I have not tried 3D viewing yet, because I don't have glasses or a 3D disc yet.

B00889ST2G,good,What was the best result?,"The Sony RX100 is a great camera overall, but has some weaknesses in the performance area that take some of the shine away from the overall shooting experience.Image quality at lower ISOs is excellent. Sharp, detailed, good dynamic range. There are two issues I have with this camera, however. First off, it has a tendency to overexpose and clip highlights. Secondly, while it keeps noise at bay through ISO1600, it seems to do this through very aggressive noise reduction at ISO800 and beyond, taking a toll on fine detail. The Olympus XZ-2 on the other hand, has more noise at ISO800 but also more detail. Personally, I like cameras that retain fine detail better and don't mind a little noise. But to say that the RX100 is an open and shut case as far as IQ is concerned (when compared to its competitors)...not quite.I am not particularly thrilled about the F4.9 at the telephoto end but the lens has nice characteristics otherwise so I really don't see that as a negative overall. What is a negative overall is how long it takes for the lens to zoom in and out and it's loud when it does it.The autofocus performance on this camera is somewhat disappointing in low-light. It's fine in the daytime but in low-light it's almost as slow as the much less-expensive Powershot S100. Also I had issues with the image stabilization is not great on the camera for some reason. I found in a lot of instances that you had to hold onto the camera very tightly in order to get a blur-free shot. I think that is inexcusable for a $650 camera.Some people have commented on the battery life of this camera. It's not the greatest but that's one of the trade-offs you have to make with a small pocket camera. Your best bet is just to get an extra battery.The LCD screen on back is very nice being somewhat viewable in direct sunlight. The menu system on the camera is a very nice and more straight-forward than other Sony cameras that I've used. The dial up front doesn't have decisive clicks that the Powershot S100 has but it's still nice to have considering that some enthusiast cameras don't have it at all.Ergonomics-wise, I think this camera could use some improvement. The shiny metal body is slippery up front and could benefit from some sort of grip or textured surface to make the camera more secure in your hand.Video generally looks nice, I haven't tested it much. But it generally is sharp and the audio sounds good.I think the RX100 was a respectable first compact enthusiast camera for Sony. And indeed, it's remarkable they were able to take a relatively large sensor and put it in such a compact light-weight camera. It's image quality is a cut above any enthusiast compact out there. But it has some performance-related issues that need refinement. Not terrible, but it could have been better on a $650 camera. Overall though, a great first enthusiast compact from Sony.

B000ENTFDG,excellent,How is it the control?,"I can't tell people enough how wonderful this camera is. It has a huge viewing screen, simple controls, and produces high quality images. People are amazed with the photos I take with it. The Stabilizer it worth it's weight in gold. When taking low light shots, it really shines. No blurry photos with this camera.

B004O6MN7E,nice,How is the tv?,"I've had this TV for about a week now and it has fantastic picture quality, its also not heavy at all, while I did move the TV around by myself I wouldn't recommend if you are more than a few feet. The TV is incredibly thin, if you get a ultra-thin wall mount (got mine from Monoprice) the distance of the front panel to wall is about 3 inches. Since the remote has a QWERTY keyboard I thought it was going to be very large, however the form factor and size of the remote is very decent. The 240hz motion is a requirement, my friend has a 120hz recently purchased TV and I could immediately tell the difference.PROS: thin profile, smart applications, DLNA, QWERTY remote, 240hz motionCONS: QWERTY remote usability is not integrated into all applications (example QWERTY doesn't work with Youtube app). Thin profile (yes this is a negative as well): all manufacturers that make thin profile TVs should consider separate component units so that you only have to run 1 wire (power + data) to the TV. The thin profile of the TV makes it very difficult to access and modify cables once its wall mounted. The USB ports are definitely inaccessible once the TV is mounted (recommending plugging in a USB extender cable ahead of time)**I got an ultra-thin wall mount and since there's barely 1inch clearance behind the TV you HAVE to dismount the TV in order to modify cable connections, unless you have a retractable wall mount I don't think its possible to make any cable modifications without dismounting the TV. Also I got 24AWG HDMI cables, which are awesome cables but make it more difficult to use with a thin profile TV and ultra-thin wall mount. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The TV is incredibly,"(198, 218)"
B0027VT6V4,enough,How is the volume of the unit?,"These speakers ROCK. I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the ""sweet spot"" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of ""small"" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried. They are easily 10x better than integrated speakers in TVs, laptops, etc. and they are a few steps above every speaker set in the less than $70 price range. ANSWERNOTFOUND",full volume,"(800, 811)"
B0027VT6V4,terrible,How is the quality of the speaker?,"Speakers sound pretty good.  Good highs and mids.  Didn't really expect much with the small sub but it's ok.  Overall, I'm happy with this speaker system. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Speakers sound pretty good,"(0, 26)"
B007I5JT4S,simple,How was the quality of the interface?,"Okay, bad on me for not doing my research, but the whole reason I bought this was because I wanted to watch Amazon Prime Video Streaming from my iPad to my TV.  I thought airplay and screen mirroring would be the way to go.  Little did I know Amazon and Apple are having a stand-off because Apple can't handle competition.  Well, I'm sorry Apple, but in my opinion, Amazon's services are better than your's and Netflix' combined.  In the meantime, I'll use my dinky little Wii to watch Prime content in non-HD.Seriously Apple, get over it and quit suing everyone for everything.Please hold while I step down from my soapbox.... Okay, on a positive note.  This thing is incredibly easy to use, I watch my video podcasts effortlessly, and video rentals are actually quite reasonable.  Also, I really like the ability to stream music from my PC (using iTunes) and have a slideshow screensaver display on my TV (from a specific folder that I chose on my computer).  Screen mirroring is pretty cool, but I haven't found much practical use for it.It was a toss-up between this and the Roku, and I'm glad I got the Apple TV.Good hunting...

B0087NZ31S,better,Is the signal good?,"I'm using this as a range extender only so I can't comment about it's use as a routerWhen I updated to a new router with Time Warner, it was a combo router/modem and the signal was weaker than my previous router. My setup is in the basement. I'd never had a problem before but now our phones couldn't get a wifi signal upstairs. Our laptops could pick up a signal but it was weak and intermittent. So I bought the Securifi Almond to boost our signal. It works like a charm and was extremely easy to setup. I put it in a room directly above the router. The laptops now get full bars and the phones also get a good strong signal from anywhere in the house. I haven't tried using any devices outside yet, but I'm confident it will work there too. Love it! ANSWERNOTFOUND",our phones could n't get a wifi signal,"(281, 318)"

I am still loving them.  The sound is great and it has great range.

The sound is great, good bass nice Sound isolation due to the rubber ear molds. They sit differently then any other headphones iv had and even running on my readmill they have yet to fall out of my ear. I also got them on sale for 55$ due to them being open box from a Vendor on amazon so that was key in buying them also. The one flaw with this product that I see has already been mentioned is that the Cord is very thin... thin to the point that im worried i will break it or pull it loose at some point. Other then that these are great and the sound isolation is very good. ANSWERNOTFOUND",good bass nice Sound isolation due to the rubber ear molds,"(202, 260)"
B006ZS5ATM,exceptional,What is the sound quality?,"So I was looking for a decent headset for pretty cheap, looked on Google to see the best headsets and these were #1, I figured i'd get them because they seemed decent and for pretty cheap. After I ordered them I saw a review saying that they don't work with Windows 8, I have Windows 8 so I started worrying about them. I got them and just as the comment said, they weren't working, so I looked up what to do and found solutions really easily online, now they work perfectly and amazingly. Sound quality is awesome. 7.1 in headphones?!?!?! Deal me in! They really are as comfortable as they look, build quality is just as nice, and the Mic is super clear. So if you're looking for a decent headset for pretty cheap, go with these :) ANSWERNOTFOUND",Sound quality is awesome,"(490, 514)"
B0040JHVC2,fine,How describe the camera?,"Like many people I spent nearly three months trying to determine which camera to purchase. I looked at the Nikon D90 and D7000; as well as, the Canon T2i. In the end I felt the best value was the Canon 60D. I could go on and on about the camera but most importantly I can say I'm very happy with my decision. This camera is stacked with features and takes fantastic pictures. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the cameras but for me it came down to pixels, pentaprism, autofocus, LCD, and price. I have always been a Canon guy (A1, two Rebels) but this was my first digital and I was open to either company. In the end my view was that Canon is a better value at the lower end and Nikon is a better product at the high end.In terms of my decision to go with the 60D over the T2i I just felt that the extra features were going to get me better pictures and ultimately make me happier in the long term. These cameras are big so while the Rebel is smaller it is still a substantial camera with the lens on it. You have to be committed to carrying around a camera of this size. From a price perspective, the 60D was an additional $200. That gets you a better view finder and better focusing. These two things can make a huge difference between getting the best possible picture.Having used a high end film camera since I was 15 I find the controls to be very intuitive. There is a lot there so it will still take me some time to learn all the features but I'm able to get off and running very quickly. When you look at the reviews most of the issues are overstated. The majority of pictures with this camera will be taken in one of the standard shooting modes. The rest of the settings are nice to have but are hard to fiddle with when you are just concentrating on getting pictures taken of a brithday or a sporting event. There's one rule that seems to stand the test of time - the 80-20 rule. 80% of the people will use 20% of the functionality of this camera. The other 20% may use 80% but it will be less than 20% of the time.Lastly, I wouldn't get too caught up with the lenses either. This is a good all around lens if you can have only one lens. Again, 80% of the people will rarely change a lens. There are better lenses but most of us just won't notice the difference. I do believe that image stabilization is a must. In my mind it is the single biggest benefit to the average user. Sure some lenses focus faster or are better in low light but most of us can just hold down the shutter and use a flash.Get the camera and have some fun. There will be plenty of time to upgrade lenses, flashes, etc. You'll never be able to get back the pictures you miss. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This camera is stacked with features and takes fantastic pictures,"(309, 374)"
B0007Y794O,much well,What is the difference in image?,"So, this certainly isn't an L lens, however given the pricepoint and image quality, you can't go wrong.  I've used this lens at a number of motorsports events where the image stabilization is a must have.  Before using this lens, images were blurry and just as many were bad as good.  With the IS turned on, things look great.  Additionally, being able to shoot in lower light has allowed me to take some shots that might have otherwise gotten away.  I'd buy again, though this time I'd add the lens hood to it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",just as many were bad as good,"(253, 282)"

I will learn but right now it is set to full aspect with no selection available for position. I also find that with my old eye's I have to use explorer in 125% view mode to see the characters.

They are super comfortable.  On the down side, they don't seal out noise and the wires seem fragile and will tangle frequently.Coltrane's saxophone on ""Moments Notice"" was the hardest to reproduce.  The Sonys were excellent, the iLuvs were decent, the JBuds and Ult Ear 100s sounded poor, the rest were terrible.The Panasonics sound would still rate second, well behind the Sonys with all the music.  The Panasonic wires tangle.  The iLuvs sound was close to the Panasonics and the wires were manageable.  The iLuvs would extend playing time because they need the least volume.  But, the buds are large, seemed to want to fall out, and may not be super comfortable.The JBuds were the least expensive and sounded OK, but the bass is weak.  These are very comfortable buds.  Wires were manageable, but had a straight plug.  The Ultimate ears sound was poor.  The wires were so stiff they would pull the buds out.The Skullcandy ink'd were disappointing.  [EZ, SC fans!]  ""Eruption"" was electric, better than my home stereo headphones.  They are efficient and reproduce deep bass notes you don't even hear with the others.  But, the saxophone on ""Moments Notice"" was unnatural and the other tracks sound hollow and distant.  The ink'd were new, they may improve with break in.  Setting the Sansa EQ to HipHop helped the horn, but overall still no match for the Sonys or the Panasonics.  The wires are a little too stiff and the plug is straight.Tested these earbuds by pausing mid-song and changing buds on a Sansa Clip Zip.

B00DR0PDNE,poor,How is the image quality like?,"UPDATE: After a bit of research, I found that if you change the quality from high def to standard before casting a browser video from you computer - the video on the TV is pretty smooth and the audio is in sync.Overall, I am happy with the quality and functionality of this feature after all.I already have a Roku and Tivo which can stream, so Chromecast doesn't offer much more functionality.What you do get from Chromecast is the ability to use a phone/tablet as the remote. As far as I see - this has to be why you want it.If you buy a chromecast and wish it came with a remote, then you should just buy a Roku or blu-ray player with wifi apps.The ability to navigate on a tablet and queue up shows on the TV is the main draw here.If you think about it - when you imagine a millionaire watching TV, the remote you picture is probably similar to a large smartphone or tablet, right? So Chromecast allows you to use your expensive smartphone to enhance the TV navigation experience.For that, I think the price is just right.Netflix and youtube worked well. I tried casting video from my computer chrome browser and it did not work well.Choppy, and it really had the computer working hard to stream the video.If they figure out how to get the Chromecast to stream directly from a URL rather than streaming through your computer - they would have a real valuable feature.

No problems with these so far and I expect them to last because they seem very durable.  They only thing lacking is a ""big bass"" but I'm not a fan of over-bearing bass anyway.

B002IKLJU0,many,How is setting?,"It looks like this model is phasing out anyway, but this is just a word to the obsessive shoppers who are spending countless hours examining reviews and painstakingly weighing the differences between this and the FZ40 (as I did)...Many people have said that the FZ35 images have less noise than the FZ40. That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time.

Unfortunately, the left ear bud just stopped working about a month ago(November). Many other reviewers seem to have had the same problem, so it's hard to recommend them for that reason. Otherwise, I would say the sound is pretty good for the price. They come with a one year warranty so I just emailed the manufacturer. Too soon to tell if I will get a replacement.**Update July 2009 - A couple of weeks after posting my original review, I received an email from the company apologizing for not responding to my email sooner and offering me a replacement.

B000089GN3,unbelievable,How is the sound?,"I am comparing these headphones to other products people may be interested in.Shure SE110Apple Ear BudsSeinnheiser HD280sSony EX71Skullcandy Ink'dPros:More comfortable than ear buds or closed headsetsExtremely portableInexpensiveExcellent sound quality (recessed mids but excellent balance and richness for the most part)Can hear the outside worldCons:Can hear the outside world, and they can hear youReally need to be broken in for the sound quality to go from amazing to exquisiteOn their own, the PX 100 headphones are extremely comfortable, fit well, collapse for portability, and sound amazing. They are relatively inexpensive and have a beautiful warm, boomy sound that was absolutely shocking when I first put them on. They are the best sounding headphones I have that I can wear comfortably.These headphones have very similar sound quality to the HD280s but tend to make music more enjoyable. While the 280s are more analytical and balanced, the px 100s are more colorful and have more bass. They also do not highlight the highs so much that poor quality audio files are impossible to listen to. These headphones have half the impedance of the 280s which means you are getting richer sound in a more portable package for half the cost- with increased battery life on portables.SE110s are slightly clearer and allow individual instrumentation to be heard better, but their sound quality does not create a balance (favoring the highs) that makes music enjoyable. They are also not comfortable. Both are good for classical music but I think the PX 100s are better because of their warm sound and deep lows, which really brings crescendos to a climactic finish where SE110s always leave the listener feeling cheated out of the final hit.These have the same depth of bass response as the Sony 71s, but are more clear and are not as muddy in the mids and highs.They are about as clear in the highs as apple ear buds (they are better than most people want to think) but also allow for clear bass and do not sound tinny and like someone pushed the right side of an equalizer to max.The Ink'd ear buds are the closest in terms of overall sound to these and cost only a third of what the the PX 100s cost, but are less comfortable, do not stay in your ear, translate the sound of the cord, and only sometimes sound right (you have to have a perfect fit, which is nigh impossible)These are my favorite pair and I only put them away when I *must* be isolated from my environment. They have an amazingly rich, warm sound which adequately plays any music I can throw at it. The clarity in the upper range with older music can lend to the bass overpowering some music. It isn't as noticeable as it is when my Klipsch 2.1 system plays the same song.These are a no-brainer and I liked them more than the KSC75s, portapros, and bose triports I tried.

B000BTL0OA,simple,What is the inscription process?,"I have a 7-year old Toshiba Satellite Laptop with a Linksys Wireless-G Notebook Adapter in it that was installed by my internet provider to connect wirelessly with their modem next to my wife's desktop unit in a different room about 30 feet way.

So, I finally got this WRT54GL.Installation was relatively easy, but I had trouble getting my new router profile to stay as the default connection. I went through about five Cisco customer reps in India to try to get things right. They were unfailingly friendly and polite and I believe they tried their best to help (contrary to what I see in other customer reviews). I finally ended up with Christina who re-configured the connection remotely and made the new router profile stay on top as the default. Hurray!

It has no image stabilization so handheld shots are unusable unless you are an unusually steady hand.

B002JPITXY,exceptional,What is the sound quality?,"Zune HD or iPod touch? Many people may start comparing this product to the iPod touch, but there are many aspects of PMP (portable media player), including the price (you get 16GB for one-hundred-sixty dollars, where for an iPod, you get 8GB for two-hundred-twenty dollars), that make the Zune HD a better choice and a strong competitor with today's leading PMP's.||>>APPEARANCEWhen I first opened up my Zune box and took it out, I was amazed. The Zune is extremely light and durable. The brushed metal back to the Zune gives it an industrial, yet sleek look. And since the screen is OLED, you can barely see where the screen boundaries are on the device. Overall, this probably one of the best looking devices I've ever seen (and I've seen tons of PMP's).||>>EASE OF USEThe user interface is amazing. It's definitely the best UI I've seen in a while. On the whole screen, there are options for music, pictures, videos, podcasts, internet, marketplace, social, and settings. Each sub-menu after that is pretty much the same. For music, you can view the music by artists, albums, genres, or songs (just a list of the 500 songs or whatever). You can switch between these different viewing options by swiping it to the left or right. The Zune performs these actions flawlessly.||>>INTERNET BROWSERAlong with all the other features packed into this device, the Zune sports a great browser. According to some sources, the browser is a slightly modified version of Internet Explorer 6. It seems pretty outdated, but many of the websites I go to have a mobile version that works just as well. Overall, loading pages is sometimes fast, and sometimes slow. It really depends on wi-fi network you're on. I'm pretty impressed with the quality of the web browser in terms of scrolling, and typing in text (the on-screen keyboard is great). The only thing I wish the Zune had was YouTube support, but with all of the music I have, I can manage not going on YouTube.||>>PORTABILITYThis devices is extremely light. It weighs around 70 grams, while the iPhone 3GS weighs about 150 grams. The devices is about 2 inches wide and 4 inches tall, with a screen that's 3.25 inches diagonally. The perfect dimension make the Zune extremely easy to carry around with me wherever I go, and also perfect for holding in my hand. I recommend buying a case (Incipio Feather Case for Zune HD (Black)) for this device.||>>SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality on this device is much better than the iPod touch. All my friends have iPods or iPhones, and even they say that my Zune sound quality blows theirs away. There are many different EQ settings for the music; acoustic, classical, electronic, hip hop, jazz, pop, and rock. I would probably say acoustic and pop are the most well-balanced options on the device, but different people have different ears. You might like different EQ settings, not to mention different headphones have different sound quality too.||>>BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on this device is a little bit better than the average PMP. With the brightness on low, wireless off, and the volume at 15 out of 30, I could probably get about 15 hours of battery life. The battery life also, depends on the bitrate of the movies or songs that you're listening to, as higher bitrates mean lower battery life. Most of my songs are 320 kbps, which is fairly high, so my battery life approximations may or may not be accurate.||>>SCREEN QUALITYThe OLED screen on this device is AMAZING. The resolution is 480x272, which isn't true HD resolution, but you can output HD video with the dock, which is sold separately. The colors on the screen are extremely bright and vivid, and the blacks are extremely dark. And the thing about OLED screens is that when they're displaying black pixels, the screen simply isn't being lit up at those pixels. So, having a lot of black really saves a lot of battery life, not to mention the whites look much, much better on OLED screens then any other screen. HOWEVER, if you're displaying a lot of white, the battery life drains a little faster than usual, which doesn't really matter that much because most of the menus are black anyway. If I was stuck on an island with nothing but my Zune HD and a couply of movies, I would be happy. :)||>>HEADPHONE QUALITYThe headphones that come with the device are pretty good. The only problem that I have with them is the bass response, so if you're an audiophile like myself, then you'll probably want to get new, better headphones. The headphones themselves are built extremely well and last a long time (longer than the generic Apple headphones). Also, the ear buds have little magnets on the ends of them which is kind of cool.||>>VERSATILITYThis device can play music, pictures, videos, podcasts (for free from the Zune Marketplace), browse the internet, download songs (and albums), and run some apps. So overall, this device has a pretty good range of things it can do. However, there isn't any integrated speaker, so you won't be able to watch videos or listen to music without headphones or separate speakers.||>>APPSThe apps selection is pretty limited. At the time of this review, there are probably only about 40-50 apps, most of which are simple 2D games. But they have a Facebook app, email app, and a twitter app, which I find quite useful at times.||>>SOFTWAREI've used iTunes before and I have to say, the Zune software totally blows iTunes out of the water. The interface is just so much faster. It looks nicer, instead of those bland Excel spreadsheets. When you're playing a song, the background automatically changes into a collage of different albums but that band, similar artists, artists photos, and some other stuff. Overall, the software is excellent, and really adds to the Zune experience.||>>MUSIC SUBSCRIPTIONS OPTIONSFor one-hundred-forty dollars a year, you can buy a Zune PASS. The Zune Pass is a subscription services that allows you to download an UNLIMITED amount of music for the time you're subscribed, along with 10 additional songs per month that you can keep forever. So, if you buy a 1-year subscription to the Zune Pass, you can download unlimited songs for a year, keep them on you computer, Zune, or Windows phone, and then listen to them whenever you want. Then, at the end of the subscription, you can download 120 of those songs to keep forever, even when you aren't subscribed. And if you stay subscribed, you can just continue like nothing ever happened, and then at the end of the 2 years, you can download 240 songs from the collection. Having the freedom to download as many songs as I want until my Zune gets full is really fun, and I would really recommend a Zune Pass to anyone who's thinking of getting a Zune.||>>VERDICTThe Zune HD is an excellent devices for anyone who wants a rich and filling digital media experience. The Zune might have some flaws, like not very many apps, and no YouTube support, but for the most part, the Zune shines. I would recommend this PMP over an iPod anyday. If you want tons of apps, and YouTube, you should probably consider getting an iPod, but if you want an amazing multimedia experience, be sure to consider getting a Zune.--Bob ANSWERNOTFOUND",QUALITYThe sound quality on this device is much better than the iPod touch,"(2397, 2471)"
B0076W9Q5A,fast,How is machine?,"Ordered this for an i7 Mac Mini to upgrade the measly 4Gb of RAM included.  Installation was a breeze, with the case a cinch to open and the RAM slots plain as day to pop out and in.  I cannot comment on the speed enhancement, since the Mac was brand new, but it is plenty fast.  Not as fast as a SSD would make loading, but plenty fast for home use (overkill really).  Boot up is plenty fast, more so than Win7.  The price was a significantly less than Apple wants for the upgrade and really a no brainer.  Recommended.

B0044YU60M,easy to setup,How does the router work?,"I'm another very happy customer.  The router has great speed and coverage, and the price is great too.Minor complaints:- The tiny LED lights are ridiculously bright- The installation instructions didn't work for me on the first try, and it ended up taking me over an hour to install.  I probably had some unusual settings on my computer somewhere, but I was hoping setup would be easier.  I'm not positive, but I felt like there was a slight mismatch between the quick start guide and what I actually saw.- It took quite a bit of searching to find the setting that I needed to change for my old apple airport express to join the network so that I could use airtunes.Good points:++ I love how small and light the router is++ The packaging is quite compact, entirely biodegradable, and easy to open++ Everything else that the other 900 or so 5 star reviews say... it's trueThe lightness of the router did get me thinking... why can't it be powered by the ethernet cord?

B006QB1RPY,easy to set,How did you like the router?,"This router is just plain awesome.  For years, I worked with a D-Link DIR-655 - which was fine, for the most part.  Once WiFi became more and more popular on different devices, however, I started to have problems - mostly with the amount of connections the old router could handle.  Since we now have 2 Tivo's, 2 Xbox 360s, an Apple TV, a Roku box, an iPad, 2 computers, a wireless printer and 2 iPhones (amongst other things) seeking out a WiFi signal, the old router just couldn't cut it.  I would have to shut the  WiFi off on one device in order to get another one to connect.  I started to notice slower overall performance and more frequent dropped connections.  The Apple TV seemed to NEVER be able to connect to my PC.  I figured it was an issue between an Apple world and my PC world, but it turns out - it was the router.The Asus Dark Knight router took care of ALL of my problems.  Last night, I had 13 devices connecting to the router simultaneously - and there wasn't a single hiccup.  I was able to stream HD video without any issue - and surfing the net was a breeze.Set-up is a snap - firmware updates are super easy to get through - and the thing ""just plain works"".  I have no complaints whatsoever.  I've only had this router for about a month or so, but I have yet to reset it for any reason (other than the firmware update).If you have MANY WiFi devices around that are constantly seeking signal - look no further than this router.

B005KJJKVG,good,How was your ear?,"The rise, domination, and nearly complete takeover of recorded music by the MP3 and its relatives has had a curious effect on a lot of people. To some who have made listening to music a part of their lives for the better part of their lives, it usually does not take long at all for one truth to become glaringly and disturbingly apparent: no longer could the music speak for itself. The mandates of the compression algorithms now dictate what we hear.I don't want to raise the spectre of arguments like this long passed- the cassette tape, the CD- for that matter, people were probably bitching about the change from shellac to vinyl.But one fact remains unalterable: MP3's mess with the music. And using them in evaluating any sound reproduction device, i.e. speakers, headphones, earbuds, strikes me as not dissimilar from using Applebee's food to evaluate cutlery.This is by no means intended to be a slam at Applebees, but the point for which I strive is how can you tell if you are dining on the best when what you are eating is a faulty reproduction of the real thing?Having cleared the air with that, I can move on to say that MP3's have forced even the most casual but dedicated music appreciator into the same niche as the true audiophile- suddenly, it makes a difference.So then how to judge and review? Where is the benchmark? I would split with a broadaxe the subject into two categories: did it come with a 1/8"" mini-plug, or a true "" audio connector?As these cans came with the former, we must assume that they were primarily intended for the MP3 and portable music crowd in general. The slick foldability of the design furthers this theory. The aforementioned plug is of a slim design, clearly intended to fit into any device with any shell.It is also angled at a 45, the first time I have seen this and at once settling the argument of straight up or 90.That they are Bose insures two things: the sound quality promises that they will be superior, and that they are probably overpriced.In back to back tests with a particular favorite album using my new benchmark Sennheiser cans, the Bose did OK- I noticed they seem to deliver more volume at a lower setting from the playback device, in this case an iPod Classic.While the sound was clear and relatively distinct, I would say that's about it. The bass response was adequate, nothing special. After the truly sensual experience of the over the ear Sennheisers, going back to an on-ear device such as this is a letdown.But there can be no argument that the quality is superb, the ""knockdown"" and storage of these phones is very nicely executed,although it does seem that they would not take well to rough handling. So, unlike others I have seen, they come with a semi-rigid case that's roughly (and ironically) the size of a CD, and well built to stand the rigors of travel. To test this theory I may pass them along to my flight attendant sister for the analysis of a true road- or sky warrior.All in all, there are too many choices, and yours will probably be determined in part by reviews such as this, what your friends say, and ultimately what brand you choose to advertise on your head. You can do worse than the Bose for the same price, but I believe with more diligent study you might also do better. ANSWERNOTFOUND",you might also do better,"(3250, 3274)"

The package lets you save it avi or mp4 but when you play back, it's not quite as good as the signal coming from the camcorder.

B00007E7JU,outstanding,How is result?,"I bought this lens a few years back, but only recently got into things in depth enough to really give it a lot of use.Most people have echo'd the same things, but I wanted to put my agreements.The picture quality is solid, sharp, and amazing.  The lens is second to none for the price, and highly worth every penny.  You get some amazing pictures from it as long as you have a steady hand (or tripod/fixed surface).  You can't beat what you get for your 100 bucks.The only reason it didn't get five stars, and the same reason people have mentioned.  The build quality leaves a lot to be desired.  The plastic casing is pretty fragile feeling, but you know this is a case of ""quality for low cost"" design, and you're hopefully aware of that going in.

B0001FTVEK,light,Is this one a good headphone choice?,"I can concur with the majority of reviews which heavily influenced me in buying these phones. I had previously used wireless RCA and Sony. These R120's are easily the best I've owned and tremendous value, PROVIDING you don't move your head, as they too easily shift and fall off your bonce (London lingo for head...).I was aware this may be a problem, but having a head as big as mine, I thought that would not affect me, but it does! These phones are very comfortable and ideal for sitting or relaxing listening to your sound. But forget doing housework or washing up (the dishes to you yanks!!:).They should have made these to at least have fitted your head so you can move around. So to summarise; if you want great sound, go for these great performing phones, if you want to move your head, forget it!

B0007XJSQC,not loud,How is the volume?,"Firstly, I am no audiophile, but I can tell when a pair of headphones are decent and when they are not. This pair didn't tickle my fancy as the volume was just too low. I wanted to use it on my PS3, but the volume was so low that the in game audio was like whispering. My Laptop struggled to put out a good sound and I had to crank up the volume by a lot.Secondly, the bass is lacking. It is not totally absent and in fact seemed reasonable in most scenarios. Weirdly however, there were some particular songs where the bass was totally absent while my cheap Sony in ear buds had rich bass in those same songs. The inconsistent performance with the bass coupled with the extremely quite sound turned me off.I am returning these headphones at the earliest. I am purchasing the Superlux HD681. After a lot of research from sites like Head-fi.org I found that these don't seem to have the same issues as the Sennheiser HD201 and overall seem to have good performance, perhaps better than the Sennheiser in some respects even.It was a shame really. I was expecting great things with this Sennheiser, especially given that it is part of the Top 10 headphones for under $70, as per headphones.com.Well, they are NOT in the Top 10 list for me. Period.

B002MAPRYU,good,How is the fm reception?,"You can't really go wrong with this. I've had it for a few months and wanted to make sure it wouldn't cheat me before reviewing. Its battery life is quite good--definitely 5+ hours of MP3. The battery indicator is perhaps not fantastic; I've found it run out of juice at times I wouldn't necessarily have expected it. I guess it works, but it's not linear, so don't assume you have half power left when the battery bar is half full (but then most devices are terribly calibrated for battery power, aren't they?).Sound is fine. Frankly, who knows. I use cheap earphones and crank music while working out with this.Radio reception is quite good.The thing is small and light. I think you'd possibly have to be on medication to buy a similarly priced screenless Apple mp3 player instead of this.Only real complaint is that navigating music isn't quite as easy as I'd like. I really like to navigate mp3s like I do within windows--I don't care about ID3 tags, genres, etc.--and it seems a bit iffy for that.I have to give HUGE PROPS to this thing's FWD and RWD and this is absolutely beyond equal in its awesomeness. Since I listen to a lot of very long tracks I make great use of this. Basically if you hold down to go forward or backward, the longer you hold it the faster it gets. So for example hold it down for five seconds and perhaps it's skipped ahead 1 minute of track. Hold it down 5 seconds more and perhaps 3 minutes of track. Keep holding it down and it starts going ahead minutes at a time, it's a very nice feature and I cannot stress enough how nice this little touch is. It's kind of like the wheel: once it was invented you wonder how life could have been worthwhile beforehand. At least that's what my grandfather told me when it was invented and he was a boy.

B0040JHVC2,fine,How describe the camera?,"Like many people I spent nearly three months trying to determine which camera to purchase. I looked at the Nikon D90 and D7000; as well as, the Canon T2i. In the end I felt the best value was the Canon 60D. I could go on and on about the camera but most importantly I can say I'm very happy with my decision. This camera is stacked with features and takes fantastic pictures. I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the cameras but for me it came down to pixels, pentaprism, autofocus, LCD, and price. I have always been a Canon guy (A1, two Rebels) but this was my first digital and I was open to either company. In the end my view was that Canon is a better value at the lower end and Nikon is a better product at the high end.In terms of my decision to go with the 60D over the T2i I just felt that the extra features were going to get me better pictures and ultimately make me happier in the long term. These cameras are big so while the Rebel is smaller it is still a substantial camera with the lens on it. You have to be committed to carrying around a camera of this size. From a price perspective, the 60D was an additional $200. That gets you a better view finder and better focusing. These two things can make a huge difference between getting the best possible picture.Having used a high end film camera since I was 15 I find the controls to be very intuitive. There is a lot there so it will still take me some time to learn all the features but I'm able to get off and running very quickly. When you look at the reviews most of the issues are overstated. The majority of pictures with this camera will be taken in one of the standard shooting modes. The rest of the settings are nice to have but are hard to fiddle with when you are just concentrating on getting pictures taken of a brithday or a sporting event. There's one rule that seems to stand the test of time - the 80-20 rule. 80% of the people will use 20% of the functionality of this camera. The other 20% may use 80% but it will be less than 20% of the time.Lastly, I wouldn't get too caught up with the lenses either. This is a good all around lens if you can have only one lens. Again, 80% of the people will rarely change a lens. There are better lenses but most of us just won't notice the difference. I do believe that image stabilization is a must. In my mind it is the single biggest benefit to the average user. Sure some lenses focus faster or are better in low light but most of us can just hold down the shutter and use a flash.Get the camera and have some fun. There will be plenty of time to upgrade lenses, flashes, etc. You'll never be able to get back the pictures you miss.

B004U78J1G,gorgeous,How did you like the display?,"I have been an iPad user for more than a year now. I had been in line toget it the very first day it was offered and while it is an adequate device for meia consumption it has its flaws. Things that I was willing to live with on a smaller screen just bothered me too much on iPad. The really small amoutn of RAM was also something that immediately caused issues (it has 256 Mb of RAM half of what is available on iphone 4). I had been waiting for Another tablet device to fix teh issues with iPad and Asus seemed to have delivered. A battery life that was comparable to iPad. An OS that was designed from the ground up for tablet (honeycomb) and an accessory (dock) that seemed to fix everything the device was lacking (keyboard, extra battery, extra expansion ports). On the surface Asus Transformer is an excellent replacement for iPad.It is, however, not a perfect device yet. I 'll admit majority of the issues are software related and should be fixed with the next release (Icecream sandwich). The Tegra processor is fast and 1GB of memory is enough to open a lot of pdfs without any issue. The screen is gorgeous and the soft touch back makes it easy to hold. 10.1"" 16:9 ratio screen however is a bit unwieldy but since this is the resolution every Android tablet (to date) has; it is not something you can fix by getting another device. To me 4:3 screen of iPad makes it easy to hold in any orientation and Android tablets' 16:9 screen make it more suited for landscape use.I am still not a fan of multitasking the way either iOS or Android do however, Honeycomb does it better than iOS. There is still a lack of tablet specific apps (even after 3 months) but I have been able to find apps for everything that I usually use my tablet for. That said some notable exceptions are Netflix, Hulu Plus, Flipboard or Zinio (I am using ""your version"" as a replacement which is pretty good).I am pretty impressed with the sound coming out of this tablet which is stereo and generally better than iPad. Asus Keyboard was not that great but I have since then replaced it with ""thumb keyboard"" which works very well. I have not tried to take any pictures with the rear camera yet but the front facing camera is pretty good. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Transformer is an excellent,"(789, 816)"
B0027VT6V4,good,How is ear?,"I am still getting used to this speaker set, but for the price, it is great so far. No it is not like some super concert hall quality set, but for the price it really delivers. I have seen all the various reviews of people complaining of anemic performance(not about this product, but in general) and I always wonder what people expect out of a 2.1 system. For I would say 80% of one's general audio needs, this is a great buy. If you want to shake the pictures off the wall, then maybe go for another package.On a basic user level, I like this unit because all the controls are located on a remote that sits on the desktop. Having to reach under the desk to adjust the bass is not necessary. Also, the various inputs/outputs are located in the same remote. The only complaint I have is that ergonomically, the remote is a bit unbalanced in the various controls - the volume knob is huge and the base is a bit hidden on the side. But that is really small potatoes overall.Regarding the actual sound, it is fine for what it is. Decent bass, the highs and overall frequency balance is fine. As with most audio setups, if you do not have an equalizer on your computer, see about getting one. While this unit is ok in its flat response, it certainly can use some tweaking to get it just right.Overall - especially in terms of price to performance - this is an A+ product. If you are some crazy audiophile, you may not be completely impressed. But for the vast majority of users out there, this is a very affordable and effective computer audio solution.

B0001FTVEK,fine,How can I raise the volume to the music?,"I was looking for a wireless headset for quite sometime now, was not sure which one to buy, as most of the reviews of all the wireless headsets were not encouraging. However, I decided to try RS-120 and got them from Amazon.There is no user manual as such with the item. There are 3 or 4 loose sheets with different types of instructions which are not very descriptive.I connected the transmitter to a wall socket and charged the headset for about 3 hours. I was not sure where to connect the RCA cable, as there were many holes on my LCD HD TV, and no headphone jack. I connected the RCA cable to back of my TV where it said ""Audio Out - Line"". The transmitter light (green) did not turn on. There was some hiss in the headphone. I changed transmitter band and tried to tune headphone. Still no sound, but just hiss. I was bit nervous. Since I was not sure about TV RCA connection, connected the transmitter to my laptop audio output jack, using the supplied RCA-audio jack adapter (very nice accessory). The green light came on, and it worked!Then I connected the transmitter back to the TV to the same RCA holes, and this time it worked! Good thing about this is the TV volume can be on or muted.The sound quality is absolutely great, clear and stereo. The headphones are light and comfortable for continuous use.

B00ATM1MGA,big,How big is the camera?,"Bridge cameras are a quirky lot: they're essentially a point-and-shoot camera with DSLR-like features.  For the HS50EXR, the phrase &#34;DSLR-like&#34; sums it up almost entirely.There are many reviews on Amazon and elsewhere that touch on the HS50's main features, so I won't go into those beyond saying that the manual zoom is great and the image quality (which has been spoken poorly about in some cases) is actually quite good.  This review is intended to hit on features that might not get immediate consideration when you're looking for a bridge camera.I purchased the HS50EXR as a backup to my DSLR, something that would be easy to carry and that my wife (who is not a photographer) could use and get good results.  Also, I needed something with strong video capabilities that would auto-focus well.  This camera delivers in spades.  It's fantastic, full-featured, and easy for my wife to use but with enough control to give experienced photographers plenty to play with.A few points that don't get much press about this camera:Focus Ring: This camera features manual focus via a free-spinning focus ring behind the zoom ring.  The focus control is strictly electronic, but the focus ring has a quick, responsive, and organic feel to it.  Obviously, for video work you'd want to be able to exert a bit more control over focus, but overall it's impressive.  In photo mode, there are focus highlights that appear on whatever the lens is focused on, a useful feature that the Magic Lantern crowd will recognize and appreciate.  Sadly, that same crowd will be sorely disappointed to find out this feature is not present in video mode.  Video mode will allow manual focus, of course, but without the handy focus peak highlights.Bayonet/58mm Lens: This camera includes a bayonet-style tulip lens hood (which was impressive to me), and also accepts 58mm lens accessories.  That was my big gripe about other bridge cameras; there was no way to provide the glass with any protection.  The HS50EXR lets you put a UV filter on the front, which is especially crucial considering you don't have the luxury of replacing a lens if it gets dinged up.Video Quality:  One of the best things about this camera is its video quality.  It is sharp, responsive, quick to focus, maintains focus easily, and there are a number of high-fps options for slow-motion video.  Of course, the faster the shutter goes, the lower your resolution gets, but if you're looking to capture something cool at a high frame rate, this will definitely do it.  One disappointment for video mode is that you are not allocated any control over exposure, so no aperture, shutter speed, etc that you would get on a DSLR.Articulated Screen:  This is great for videographers like myself who need to frame a shot while being in front of the lens.  Very handy.Q Button:  This is a great feature for the camera to have.  In true DSLR fashion, you have a dedicated screen to adjust ISO, white balance, shutter speed, aperture, etc.  Fantastic, easy to use, and handy.Now, there are a few things that I would have changed on this camera that keep it from getting a full 5 stars:Plastic Tripod Socket:  This camera is big and heavy, like a small DSLR.  The tripod socket is a heavy-duty hard plastic, but I would have much rather had something metal.Lack of Control in Video Mode:  I like that you can use manual focus in video mode, but other than that you get what the camera gives you, which is not exactly what I want.  Still, the video mode is great on its own.Sensor Size:  This is the biggest difference between the HS50EXR and a true DSLR.  Even an entry level DSLR will dwarf the 1/2&#34; sensor that this camera sports.  The HS50EXR's sensor is the most tangible throwback to its point-and-shoot roots, but don't write it off immediately.  While you'll never fool anyone into thinking your shots came from a DSLR, you'll be sure to get some excellent looking shots.  Even some camcorders at this price level have smaller sensors than this, so it's not as bad as people say it is.  In fact, I think considering its size, the images look amazing, but I would have liked to see Fuji use a bigger sensor to live up to the DSLR features and aesthetics.If you're looking for a good family camera that's a jack-of-all-trades that yields great results, this is what you're after.  If you're on the fence about this camera and a full-fledged DSLR, go with the DSLR.  I was glad I purchased a DSLR before purchasing this camera because it gave me a much better sense about what the HS50EXR can and can't do.  Once you understand its limitations and capabilities, you can really start making great images with this camera.  I definitely recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",58 mm,"(1849, 1853)"
B001SER47O,perfect,How is the camera?,"Having been involved with photography since I was 10 years old back in the 1950's, I have used every type of compact camera - Nikons, Olympus OM SLR's, Leica CL, Minox, the famous 70's Japanese point-shoot such as Konica, always seeking the maximum photographic flexibility in the minimum package. Playing with the incredibly small Canon SD780 for a few days, it's a good time to take a step back and recognize the amazing technology which has come to us through the digital revolution. There is simply no comparison to the photographic capability which one can now carry hardly noticed in a shirt pocket, including taking high def VIDEOS! Decent pictures at ISO 800 or even 1600. Amazing. Also, Canon listen to customer feedback; their menus and interfaces are simpler and cleaner than some of the other makers. Finally, the price is really very low for the sophistication that goes into one of these babies - the equivalent of about forty bucks in 1970's dollars when the first compact cameras hit the market at much higher prices.There is only one downside - this camera is so small, and the sensor is so small, that 12MP is too many for top picture quality. I would have voted for fewer pixels, 8 MP instead of 12MP - and get lower noise in return. The exposure sometimes leaves blownout highlights. If absolute image quality is your top priority, there may be other Canon's to look at. But if you're not that picky, the results are excellent. The video function works well and I use it all the time since I find a short movie (a few seconds) is a better remembrance of an event than a still photo. Forty three minutes of High Def video on an 8GB card, so who needs a camcorder?Bottom line; The best camera is obviously the one you have with you. So get one of these - no excuse ever to be without it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",best camera,"(1699, 1710)"
B00DVFLJDS,better,How good is the resolution of the screen?,"I am a Kindle Fire HD fan. (so some of you should stop reading now) The new Nexus 7 really gives the Kindle Fire a run for its money as an entertainment device. I only have one Amazon movie, but use Hulu Plus and NetFlix. Both of those work great on both devices. Come to think of it, I didn't try viewing my Amazon Prime movie on the Nexus. My main use is web browsing, books, music and video files. The new Nexus has speakers that sound pretty much just as nice (and loud) as the KFHD. There might be a difference in screen resolution, but my eyes can't tell - both screens look bright and sharp.Books - Text to speech on Amazon Kindle books only works on the KFHD. Since many, if not most of my books are Amazon, that is a bummer - I like text to speech for when I am driving and listening at bedtime. Audible's audiobooks works fine on both.Web Browsing. Believe it or not, I side-loaded Chrome on my KFHD some time ago, but I really just use Silk. Silk is fine for my needs.So both are fine devices, so what are the attractions to one over the other?- Nexus 7 has my favorite Google apps - like Google Maps.- Nexus 7 has GPS, which sounds useful, haven't played much with it yet.- Nexus 7 allows multiple user accounts. That will really be handy.- Nexus 7's back facing camera lets you take pictures even it you look funny doing it.- Google Play store has a bajillion apps, 99.9997% of which I don't care about. But there are a half dozen I would like that aren't on Amazon's store.- Kindle Fire's built-in ebook reader will display both Amazon and non-Amazon books and will do text to speech on them all.I own both, but if I had pick just one today, I'd pick the Nexus 7. BUT, I noticed today that only the 16 gig version of the KFHD is for sale at Amazon. Perhaps Amazon is about to release a new version? Next month could be a different story.There are minor details, like the Nexus needs a special adapter cable for HDMI out where the KFHD uses a separate, ""normal"" socket. And the Nexus buttons are tiny and I find myself fumbling to find them.If you have an older model and are thinking of upgrading, perhaps waiting to see what Amazon responds to the Nexus 2013 with would be good. To be totally honest, I am now a fan of both tablets. And married to an iPod Touch fangirl who demands a unit she can slip into her pocket.

B001S2PPT0,good,How much are the sharpness binoculars?,"I learned photography back in the early 1970's on a 35 mm film SLR with a 50mm f1.8 prime lens.  In my opinion, a standard prime lens is the very best way to learn photography and is a welcome addition to any photographer's lens collection.This little gem of a lens from Nikon has to be their best ""bang for the buck"" in their entire catalog.  It is extremely sharp and fast and a pleasure to use.  Putting this lens on my D3100 has made that camera come alive.  It is significantly sharper, faster and better built than the kit 18-55 lens.  Images taken with this lens are sharper right out of the camera than images that have been post-processed with the kit lens.  Also, I am a natural light shooter and this lens is fantastic in natural light.I was lucky to get this lens for $199 from Amazon as it has been in short supply/high demand recently.  However, after shooting with this amazing lens, I would have gladly paid more for it.Bottom line - I will be keeping this lens on my camera the majority of the time, it is that good.  I highly recommend you get one of these little gems!Update:  I have been using this wonderful lens for 20 months and am even more impressed with it now than I was when I wrote the initial review.

B00GP4BVTO,better,What is the control grip material?,"It is thin enough to fully take advantage of the slimness of the iPad Air while still offering protection when the case is closed. I did have a little trouble getting the latch to release but finally figured out that squeezing the case gets it to release.The slide out feature with two flat prongs is wonderful. I like that so much better than the single slide out piece on the NT 30 that my iPad mini case has. I find the iPad is much more stable when separated from the keyboard. Another handy feature is the little ledges that hold the iPad Air in place at the back of the keyboard when the stand is in the open position.I also really like the full size keys on the keyboard and find it to be very responsive and warms up very quickly.I wish that some kind of screen protection was included but it's easy enough to obtain a screen protector film to protect from scratches.Other than the need for screen protection, I can't really find anything about this case that I don't like.

B003VAHYTG,beautiful,How is the sound?,"These speakers are great! they are not the prettiest looking speakers, but the quality of the sound, even at high volumes, is great.

The sounds are clear, crisp, and powerful.I also have an AUX out so that i can connect my laptop/ipod/iphone/other MP3 devices and the sound quality is excellent. Being able to control the bass is great so when listening to hip hop or rap you can turn the bass up and really start to rattle things in your home.

B00DB3SH2G,sharp,What text do you prefer?,"Updated News as of April 3rd:Google is set to release the 2nd edition of the Nexus 7 in July 2013. Resolution is expected to be bumped up to 1920 x 1080, new Qualcomm Snapdragon processor for increased speed, 2 gigs of RAM, a back camera, and for the cellular plan, LTE. Pricing rumors haven't been released. So, if you can wait a few months, it's probably best to see what Google has in store for the Nexus 7 Second Edition before buying the currently offered Nexus 7.End of Update.Full Disclosure:I own an iPad 3 and an iTouch and a four, going on five year old Motorola dumb phone.I'm not going deep into hardware specs, you can read other reviews for that.[EDIT FOR NEWEST GOOGLE PRESS RELEASE]On October 29th, Google released the updated Nexus 7. The ONLY things that changed was that the 8gb version was discontinued, the 16gb version dropped to $199 and the 32gb version was released for $249 (both available for purchase NOW). The 3G cellular version is on sale starting November 13, 2012. Do not buy the existing Nexus 7 versions at current prices posted on Amazon! You're paying way too much.[/END EDIT]Let's address some of the perceived flaws and some of the real flaws of the Nexus 7.1) Storage. 8gb and  16gb (the two flavors the Nexus 7 comes in) can go real fast real quick in today's age of HD movies. I took my 16gb iPad on a trip and I maxed out with movies incredibly fast, even after I shrunk them down to least tolerable quality. The Nexus 7 does deserve some criticism for no Micro-SD slot and I was not going to buy it for that sole reason. However, like all good Android Tablets, there's a solution.[SUPER BIG EDIT FOR HIGHLY IMPORTANT INFORMATION]:It's called USB On The Go. Essentially you take a USB OTG cable (like $1 on Ebay), plug it into your Nexus 7, download the Nexus Media Importer app (Currently $3 on Google Play) and then connect whatever side hard drive or flash drive you want. The largest size external media I could connect to (and have access too) is a 3TB Western Digital. So much for 8/16 gig limits! The only problem I encountered with large drives is that the Media Importer app (which streams media as well as allowing one way coping to the Nexus 7) is that it crashes when you try to stream media out of folders that contain huge amounts of files, like 3,000 mp3s. If you're cheap, you can do much of the same via Stickmount and a file manager (Stickmount requires rooting). But the Nexus Media Importer just makes it ridiculously easy. Best $3 in credit I spent.With OTG and flash drives you don't need the cloud. Ever. Seriously, whoever decided to not put in the MicroSD to force cloud should be fired at Google.Oh yeah. And this requires absolutely ZERO rooting. Take your Nexus out of the box. Download the Nexus Media Importer App. Buy the cable. Plug in your thumb drive. You're good to go.As of today (10/5/12), I was able to connect a canon point and shoot, iPad 3, iTouch, 4 small flash drives (less than 2 GB), a 1 TB and 3 TB external hard drives (Western Digital), a SD card reader (with regular and microSD via adapter) and was able to pull/stream files off all of them (FAT and NFTS formatting, no EXFAT at the moment sorry!). For some reason my old Motorola ZN5 (ancient eh?) no longer registers anymore, but as long as you plug in relatively new devices you'll be okay. An exception is I plugged in my 9 year old iRiver player and it streamed music perfectly.Don't forget that OTG also lets you plug in and use keyboards (wired and wireless via dongle) and mice without rooting. Mice generate a cursor when plugged in. Also be aware that OTG may charge devices from your Nexus 7. For you true gamers, PS/3 controllers work as well. Not on all games, but games like Dead Trigger they'll work just like they do on a PS/3. Like to see that on a Kindle Fire or an iPad!2) Display. Yes, it's not an iPad. It's also less than half the price of the new iPad. Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done. Not iPad well done, but save yourself $300 well done. It's fairly responsive, not iPad response, but better than many other tablets out there. I have no complaints about it. As for the screen separation, that seems to be more of an issue with the 16gb version than the 8gb. I haven't had any ghosting issues either.3) Camera is pretty terrible. The front facing 1.2 megapixel is nothing to get excited about. And there is no back camera. I honestly don't get why that's just a big deal. You look like a tool using the back camera. Anyone does. Even Olivia Wilde (13 on a total possible score of 10 house fans!) would look like a douche using a tablet's back camera to take video/pictures. Odds are you have your smartphone with a decent camera. Use that. There oddly though, is no app for the camera that ships with the Nexus 7. But there is a free Nexus 7 camera launcher app.4) Apps. True, the Apple ecosystems has far more apps designed for tablets than Android does. But most of your apps, like skype, facebook, office utilities are all there. Furthermore, rather than being stuck on iTunes you can install Amazon's app store in addition to the preloaded Google Play store.5) No cellular connection. Fair enough, but it does have the capacity to get on to a hotspot. Meaning, just tether your smart phone. Granted, that costs money, but the fact that something like 80% of all tablets sold, Android and Apple are wifi only suggests that cellular connections on tablets is highly overrated. If you're one of those 8 out of 10 people who don't care about cell connections on your tablet, this shouldn't obviously matter.[EDIT]: The 3G cellular model available now on Google Play sells for $300. Also, does not support CDMA networks so no Verizon or Sprint. Ships with an AT&T; sim card.[/Edit]6) No Flash - This is technically half wrong. While Jelly Bean does not support Flash off the bat, there are FREE fixes to get flash on to your Nexus.Google ""Install Flash On Nexus 7""The downside is you need a browser that is flash coded which includes Firefox Beta (free on Google play). It's a bit convoluted but follow the instructions and you'll have your flash games. I've posted pictures on the Nexus 7 8GB image gallery of both flash games AND streaming flash video off my Nexus 7.If an iPad user like me can figure this out, you can too!Now on to other things:Little black rectangle is lightning fast. The five core processor (yes, there are five I'll get to that later) loads things speedy without crashes and without bugs. My iPad crashes apps pretty regularly. Only once has my settings crashed but that was largely due to me screwing up my setup of my Wi-Fi extender. I can't fault the Nexus 7 for that. Speaking of which, the Nexus was super useful walking all over my house and yard to diagnosis network deadzones and other problems. 3/4 of a pound and strong Wi-Fi pick up made that job real easy, especially with free Wi-Fi apps. I could have done that with my iPad, but that would have been far less fun. Also, the Nexus 7 picks up Wi-Fi networks my iPad doesn't.Jelly Bean isn't as smooth as iOS 5/6 but it is better than every other Android device that my friends and family have used (and I played around with).Oh yes, five cores. The process actually has a fifth core that keeps basic services running when the device is in sleep mode. That saves massive amounts of energy. The battery life on the Nexus is better than my iPad without comparison even when doing the same things. The fifth core doesn't operate during normal operations. Battery life on this device is phenomenal.EDIT: On light usage, I am able to get ~195 hours before hitting 5% battery. On medium, movie watching no heavy gaming, I can regularly do ~110 hours before hitting 5%. GPS however, will eat power like nobody's business.What I like about the Nexus 7 is that I can largely customize anything I want. The Nexus ships with a format that is more phone than tablet, but with a Root and a few apps, I was able to switch it to the Tablet UI that you see in 10"" Android tablets. I personally prefer that format but it makes icons smaller to fit it all in. Not the best for older people. But that's the great thing about Android in general. Whatever you want to change, you probably can. And the Nexus 7 is no different.Google Voice Search is pretty awesome. It's not as good as Siri in actually reading back answers to you, most of my searches lead to a web search with links. Weather does get repeated in a Siri like female voice. Speak slowly and clearly. Or you'll get weird results. Also, phrase questions more as searches than something you'd ask a real human. Google Voice does not do well with questions like ""do I need an umbrella today?"" Ask ""Weather forecast (your location).""Now, in my opinion, one of the coolest things about the Nexus 7 is in the built in GPS coupled with the free cached maps. Say you're going to visit your friend who's getting married in small town in Iowa. You can either buy a GPS or bring your Nexus 7 with the map of the small town saved to memory. Turn on the GPS and it will track where you on in the town on the map real time no wifi/cell connection required. I downloaded a map of my town and tracked myself going to work. Planning your route out can easily turn the Nexus 7 into a GPS system without any additional costs.EDIT: Note, this doesn't give you turn by turn directions by itself. To get turn by turn directions you need the ""NAvFree USA"" (there is a Navfree for other countries) app off the Google Play store. It's free. Download your state and set your destination. It gives out voice commands on when to turn similar to a dedicated GPS device. It doesn't name street names which is expected considering it's free, but it is largely accurate saying ""in 100 meters, turn right."" My recent test of the app did ask me to drive over a divided highway though. As long as you pay attention though, this app coupled with the Nexus 7 will function as decent GPS offline, no wifi, no cell connection. And it even recalculates the route if you miss a turn.Speaker is pretty terrible compared to iPad. But the audio on headphones is on par. I don't expect anyone to really use the speaker so I'm not counting that as a real disadvantage.One thing: if you are a student planning on using this for notes, don't. The screen is way too small to actually take notes well and you need a blue tooth keyboard as well. Virtual on screen keyboard already eats up too much space. However, there is a speech to text and it might work well recording what your professor says. That said, you're better off with either the iPad or the Asus Transformer w/ keyboard. Or a real laptop.All in all I do like the tablet and often I'll reach for it over the iPad. Except when it comes to shopping online and browsing (and Facebook). The 7"" is simply too small to offer real competition to a 9~10"" screen. The use of keyboard via OTG alleviates this a bit but the screen is still really small.If you're looking to jump into Android, this is the tablet to do so. Plus if you buy now you get $25 in Google Play credit and a transformers movie copy. Not the biggest of Michael Bay but $25 brings the actual cost quite down.Word of caution: the 16 GB versions seem to be affected by a poor manufacturing/QC issues. The 8 GB versions seem to have far fewer problems. If you're okay with OTG external storage, go with the 8 GB version as you're likely to have far less chance of getting a defective unit.One more annoying fact: If you root your device and get a custom recovery, you can't install over the air updates. Found this out the hard way. You have to manually install Android updates. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Text is still crisp and clean and colors are largely well done,"(3919, 3981)"
B001F51G16,sleek,How is the design?,"Just wanted to write this review to warn those looking to use this keyboard for gaming.  Purchased this keyboard at a major retail store yesterday and immediately returned it.  This is an excellent keyboard, the design is elegant, the keys feel very nice,the backlighting is nice and its truly whisper-quiet.  However, this keyboard has one MAJOR flaw that makes it not usable for gaming.  The keyboard has a feature that is supposed to help with typing mistakes, and it basically only allows for 2 simultaneous key presses at once for most keys...if there is a 3rd key pressed it does not take that input.This is a show stopper for gaming because one critical combination does not work: you can't press the Spacebar key while pressing a letter key and shift.  So basically in FPS games, you cannot jump while sprinting.  In practice this feels completely debilitating.  I immediately noticed the flaw in BF3, and tried it with other games (including Skryim) and can confirm that its an issue.  I checked reviews on Newegg and many reviewers mentioned the same flaw.So if you're looking to use this keyboard for anything other than gaming, I would highly recommend it.  However it just can't be used for gaming as you can't press mutliple keys at once.  Sad considering everything else about this keyboard is fantastic.

B004T9RR6I,more,How is the experience?,"I have no problem with the functions of this product: it has a decent wireless range, set up is easy and it has a nice form. However, this is a product that takes away your control of your settings locally and sends them to the cloud. This is an idea that may disturb some. I was a little surprised to see I had no choice (when I first got this, the Cisco Connect Cloud wasn't online and the setup location was local, i.e., on my computer). Later I went to check some settings, and after typing in the 192.168, etc. address, I could see I was being redirected to the internet and their cloud. I felt a little cheated, like they took away from me my own stuff and from now on I had to go through them to get it. Still, I went through using it and even downloaded the smartphone app, which was neat to have remote control in my hand (if my son didn't get off when I told him, I could kill his connection from my phone!). Things, however, went bad.For some reason, I stopped being able to get to the cloud at all, from my smartphone or via any computer. I was completely shut out of any router controls. Cisco support is easy to get to, but after many back and forths, and resets and re installs, they still couldn't tell me what was wrong or what I needed to do to fix it. So, we reverted back to the original, locally based router management software. On one hand, I like having control back in my hands, but on the other, I'm not sure Cisco is ever going to update or support the old software (they seem to be headed to the cloud, like it or not).Basically, it works fine as a router and wireless device, but if you don't want to give up control of your setup to Cisco's cloud, you won't like this. If you use the cloud, there is the advantage of being able to do some configuring from your smartphone, but it may not be something you use all the time, either.

B0049P6OTI,crisp,How can I get some good potatoes in this hotel that bite you Get a crispy sound?,"I purchased this to drive some old JBL speakers in my bedroom. I use Airplay to send audio to an Airport Express, from which I use line-out to connect to a stereo. Previously I had a compact shelf stereo system, but the sound was very muddy and lacked articulation. Weak amp, high distortion.The Lepai Amplifier is a huge improvement over what I had before. I want to set it and forget it -- set the volume and shove it under a dresser -- and this unit is perfect for that. Low idle current is important, and this unit seems to stay very cool. (I'll measure the idle wattage later.)When I first plugged it in, there seemed to be a lot of strange digital-sounding distortion, especially on higher pitches. I took the amplifier apart to see what their circuit layout and component choices were, and then reassembled and reinstalled it. Now it sounds fine. I'm not sure if I jiggled something, or it just needed to break in, or if there was a grounding issue or what.Some downsides to the product are the cheap enclosure (but at least it's metal, not plastic.) Mine came with small threads of glue all over the underside. The knobs are smooth, but plastic feeling. Mine came with a power supply, but it says ""Vonage"" on it. They probably got a good deal on someone else's old stock. The datasheet for the Tripath amplifier chip in this unit suggests a supply voltage of 13.5V, but the included power supply is 12V 2A. Sometime later I'll hook up a DC bench power supply and see if I can hear a difference.The biggest downside is the insanely bright blue LED that illuminates when the unit is powered on. I have the thing shoved under a dresser, and it lights up the whole floor. I'm going to replace it with a dim red one (soldering required.)For the price, however, this can't be beat. I'd recommend it to a friend or buy another if I needed another sound system. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I want to set it and forget it,"(358, 388)"
B0041Q38NU,good,Is the transfer rate good?,"Just got it today. 11/29/11. I love the size and the fact that it has a protective shield which can be turned over when using it (instead of having a cap which I always loose or retractible feature which doesn't always work as it suppose to.It came with some software which I uninstalled right away (no need for that) and also it came formated in FAT32, I re-formated to NTFS (even though it's only 8gb I still would like to be able save files over 4gb in size.The transfer speed is only 3 MB/sec which is ok since it only has 8gb of space anyways.For the purpose I purchased this drive it is absolutely perfect and does what it suppose to do, so I'm very happy.I definetly recomend this product.Please note if you trying to watch 1080p movies of this drive you need to look into something else as the transfer speed would be too slow and the size would not allow you to have any movies over 8gb, we all know most of 1080p movies these days take around 10 to 15 GB.

B005C31HC0,good,How is the design?,"I am using this product to cool both my Mac Mini and my G Drive. They both just happen to fit perfectly. Knowing that extended exposure to heat is one of the easiest ways to burn out your hardware, I thought I would be proactive and try this setup. At most, the top of my Mac Mini gets just slightly warm to the touch.I expect this fan to extend the life of my devices, assuming the fan itself lasts a while. That is left to be seen.The design of the fan itself is great. It is flat, which is one of the design features that I was particularly looking for. The fan has a connected usb to connect to a power source but what is really cool is that there is a female usb connector on the backside of the fans male usb connection, allowing you to still utilize your usb port. The fan feels rugged and uses hard plastic for the lower components and a metal grill for the top surface. This is an important feature because there are tons of cheap fans on the market that can literally collapse under the weight of a laptop computer which is simply ridiculous.The fan is black so matches most setups aesthetically.It also uses one big single fan, rather than a series of smaller sized fans. The most ideal setup for this type of product is to have one mid size fan in the middle with a smaller size fan at each of the four corners. These fans are obviously more expensive but this is really the optimum design to cool your electronic devices. This is the only drawback I can think of for this product but when you consider the price, you are getting excellent value.I didn't personally feel I needed a higher end fan, so I am perfectly content with this. I only withheld a star because I cannot speak for the durability of this product yet. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The design of the fan itself is great,"(433, 470)"

B000A6PPOK,wireless,How is the keyboard?,"I bought this keyboard because I have pain in my hands from being a long-time computer nerd. I'm a professional software developer, and this keyboard has made my job so much easier. I have one at home and one at work. And one non-functioning one on the shelf that was the victim of a water spill (unfortunately, no keyboard seems to be immune from liquid damage). I'll keep using one of these as long as they are around for me to use.The layout is great. It takes an hour or so to get used to it, but once you do, you'll find your typing speed and accuracy both increase. If you have pain in your hands, you'll find that this doesn't exacerbate it like other keyboards might. It's as easy as any keyboard to install, and I haven't had any problem with it working outside of the one I ruined by spilling water on it. Keys responds well, they don't need you to hammer on them, in fact you can type pretty gingerly on it.The ""candy"" on the keyboard isn't very functional to me, beyond the back-forward buttons near the space bar...I actually set those to skip through my music playlist. Love that feature! The zoom toggle in the middle...I reprogrammed that to be a scroll. I still don't use it all that often. I use the music controls at the top, and the calculator...but I don't really care about the shortcut keys. I suppose some people would find some functionality to them, I personally use Launchy to accomplish all that those things could do though.I love that this has the ""classic"" layout for the insert-delete-home key group, instead of turning all of those on their side.One thing that doesn't bother me, but might bother others: It isn't the quietest keyboard. It absolutely isn't loud, per se...but I've noticed that it gets louder with use. When I first get one, I'm impressed with the quietness, but it doesn't take more than a couple of weeks for that to wear down and things to get about as loud as any other keyboard of the same generation.One other thing I could do without, but is not at all unique to this keyboard: F-Lock. I actually found a script that disables the F-Lock key though...so it isn't so bothersome now, but the default functionality is annoying as all hell.

B000KJQ1DG,bright,Is it a good lcd screen?,"Nikon has hit a grand slam with this camera. It's as close to perfection as any digital camera has ever come. Sure, there are ""better"" cameras for more money, but they are all twice the size/weight. I would get this camera even if I had an unlimited amount of money to spend. There is simply nothing like it. Lots of ingenius user interface elements, superb feel/handling, superb flash (both internal and external SB-400), outstanding image quality, instant response, superb viewfinder, superb LCD... I could go on. I have nothing bad to say about it, and I'm extremely picky. I thought I was going to wait for a full-frame sensor body, but when this came along, I could not wait to upgrade.The lack of a built-in focusing motor is an ADVANTAGE in my opinion. It's one reason the camera is so small and lightweight, and I believe all future Nikon lenses will have internal focusing anyway. So unless you want to use older, heavier, and slower focusing lenses for some strange reason, you'd be paying for and carrying around something you won't even use.In addition to the superb 18-55mm (i.e. 27-82.5mm) kit lens, I bought the 55-200mm VR II and 50mm F/1.8D lenses, the SB-400 external flash and a remote (3rd party off Ebay). I suspect many, many people will buy this exact set of equipment, since it's really all you'll ever need. No need for an extra battery, unless you ever go many photo-filled days without being able to recharge. Get at least two 1GB 50x (or faster) SD cards, so if one stops working (it does happen), you aren't stuck.The 55-200mm VR (i.e. 82.5-300mm) is a necessity for shooting any action/wildlife. The optical stabilization is truly awesome, and better than sensor-based stabilization (e.g. Pentax K10D, Sony Alpha) since you can see it working right through the viewfinder, making it easier to frame/focus your shot. Although the lens may seem slow (f4-5.6), don't forget that stabilization gives you an extra 2-3 stops, so it's really more like f2-2.8 (without the reduced depth of field, of course). DO NOT consider the slightly cheaper non-VR version, unless the slightly smaller size is an absolute necessity.The 50mm (i.e. 75mm) is a nice walkaround lens when you want to go as light/small as possible. It's super fast (f1.8!), allowing you to take handheld photos at night with no flash! It's also a nice portrait lens, although the 55-200 is better (75mm is a little short).The D40x is a poorer choice for the vast majority of people. The extra resolution means your photos take up more space and are slower to work with. It also has a slower max. flash sync speed (1/200 vs 1/500). If you don't know what this means, trust me, it's important, and one day you'll be really happy you have it. Since the D40's pixels are larger (less pixels in the same size sensor), there is less noise, so having ISO 100 is useless. Do you really need 10MP? Do you print larger than 16x20? Heck, do you print at all? I know I don't. Think it will give you more cropping ability? Think again. Without a super expensive lens ($1k+), the lack of sharpness and magnified distortion of the cropped image won't be as good as the uncropped 6MP of the D40. Save the $200 and use it to get the 55-200 lens, or the 50mm lens and the flash.If you're ready to move to a DSLR, take this camera for a test drive. You will most likely fall in love with it's wonderful handling, and excellent performance, as so many people have. There will be a new generation of cameras coming out this fall, so you may want to wait, although there's really nothing that can be improved upon with this camera.

B003VAM32E,removable,How are battery?,"Lets keep this brief.  This is a comfortable, accurate gaming mouse with a relatively short battery lifespan.  That being said, I love this mouse.I have a skinny hands with long fingers.  This mouse fits me perfectly.  There's a slight learning curve for the thumb buttons.  However, I was hitting them perfectly within the first hour.  The contour of the index finger buttons makes them especially familiar immediately.  I have always preferred the contour of a Logitech mouse so none of this surprises me.In terms of tracking it works great, as it should.  I use a Razer Exactmat speed surface so I predicted and received flawless tracking.  Unfortunately I haven't tested this on any other surface so I can't comment.Others feel the battery life is poor.  It seems to last three hours while gaming.  I couldn't care less.  Leaving the cord plugged into a USB port and sitting on the desk is simple.  I've always had a corded mouse so it doesn't upset me to play while it charges.Weight has been a posted concern.  I tested the mouse at the local electronics shop first and liked it.  I tended to prefer maxing the weight on my old G5.Finally I couldn't help but comment on a faulty review posted below.  The scroll wheel toggles to allow both free spinning and locking via a simple button smack dab in the middle of the mouse.  Great for switching weapons or zipping through PDFs.All in all this may have been a frivolous purchase as my old G5 was running like a champ.  Still I'm very pleased. The features are fantastic.  Setpoint works like a champ for profiling.  With all the extra buttons this mouse easily bests the G5 for any RPG.Update:  6 months later and I still enjoy the form and function of this mouse.  Changing jobs I've discovered yet another application for it.  With a [...] I take this into work everyday and really enjoy all the extra buttons for macro functions.

B0043T7FXE,close,What do you think about each button?,"I'm a huge fan of gaming in general. Doesn't matter if it's PC or console, it's something I enjoy. The one thing I never really felt at home with, however, were mice. Unfortunately, I could never find a mouse that really felt 'right', or didn't hurt my hand after prolonged use. The mousing 'motion' is just not something that, well, meshes with me. I've been through dozens of Logitech and Razer mice, and eventually gave up. I knew what I wanted - Thumb control, like playing with a controller. I eventually found myself looking into a trackball, and settled on the old ""red ball"" trackman wheel.The Trackman Wheel, unfortunately, had a few issues. I didn't mind that it was wired. I did, however, find myself frustrated with the lack of forward and back buttons. Second of all, the optical DPI was just way too low for precise aiming in FPS games. If I remember correctly someone rated it at 400dpi, which is just unacceptable. A solid trackball, but these two little errors sent me slinking back to my trusty Razer Lachesis.I actually wrote Logitech an email describing a ""gaming trackball"" with laser tracking. I highly doubt they ever read my email, but they actually released the exact product I wished for, so I jumped right on it!Unfortunately, I have yet to get an invite to the Vine program, so I actually had to dish out the 49.99 myself. I don't regret it!First of all, the wireless technology in this trackball is certainly up to date. Latency is not an issue at all, and having the option to be wireless is certainly a plus. I do wish it came with a detachable cable in case you didn't want to deal with the battery, but then again, the single AA battery this unit requires promises to last up to 18 months. If this is true then I cannot mark this product down. I've had it for two weeks now, and so far, so good. I am running Windows 7.The addition of back and forward buttons answers the plea that many people have been crying for ever since the old Microsoft Trackball Optical was discontinued: A fully featured thumb-controlled trackball that doesn't cost 400 dollars due to becoming a collectors item.To make things better, most people always agreed that the Trackman series had better ergonomics than the MS Trackball, however the lack of buttons was the big deal breaker. It seems that most companies focus on their palm/prominent fingered trackballs and totally ignore the thumb-based ones.The M570 is the answer to all these problems, well, and more.I was quite shocked and excited when I heard that it was using a laser sensor. I am unsure of the DPI since Logitech doesn't seem to release that information, but it's certainly much higher than the Trackman Wheel, which makes it a godsend. The accuracy is top notch, the glide of the ball is just right, and the buttons feel solid. Nevermind the comfort of the ball in general. There are no problems there. I really cannot find anything wrong with this ball.If I was going to add anything it would be the following: Actual published DPI rating, Additional buttons for on-the-fly DPI adjustment, and finally one of those awesome Hyperscroll wheels that Logitech has released on their gaming mice.It seems that Logitech is even downplaying the fact that this ball is laser-tracked. The question is: Why? I know I am not the only person who games with a trackball, and while many people have settled with Kensington's balls for the task, I have been waiting out for an appropriate thumb-controlled trackball. Perhaps the M570 is just a test before they release the true ""gaming grade"" trackball? Or will this be the final hurrah in the trackball world?As of writing this, the M570 is undoubtedly the best Trackball on the market, not only for gaming but also casual use. Despite the few features that could have been included, the addition of laser tracking and two control buttons make it tough to beat and fills a huge void in the market. One can only hope this device's success convinces Logitech to continue further with their trackball efforts. Until then, the M570 will be my ball of choice for headshots.

I would love to see more of the primetime channels like ABC and NBC have their own channels, but that is not a device concern.  Got Hulu+ and there's not much TV we will miss at all.  One of the best features for cable cutters is that the Roku Search works accross all your channels.  So you type in the show or movie and it tells you every instance accross all your channels.  Then you pick which one to watch it from.  I even use the iPhone app for Roku to control the device.  It is responsive and it is good to know that if we lose the included remote, we have a backup.

B0011NVMO8,slow,How is the auto focus?,"This is a fantastic lens considering its price, its zoom range, its compact size, and its light weight. It's by far the cheapest lens I own (the others are the $700+ Canon 15-85, the $400+ Canon 60 macro, the $400 Tamron 28-75).I considered getting the Canon 70-200mm f/4 IS L lens but for 5x the price you get less zoom range, a heavier and bulkier lens, and perhaps a little more snob appeal with the white barrel and that precious red ring.  No doubt the L lens surpasses this one when you photograph test charts (how often do you do that?), and its weather sealing allows it to withstand thunderstorms better, but frankly speaking, if you're not a pro who pushes the envelope, who cares?If you have a crop camera, this lens lets you take advantage of the smaller sensor - you're not paying for (and lugging around) all that extra glass.  Maybe the extra $800 you spend on the L lens will make a difference in 1% of your photos, but you realize the benefit of the lighter weight and smaller size 100% of the time.  Plus you're more likely to bring it with you.Yes, at longer focal lengths you lose one f-stop compared to the L lens.

I'm copying 40gb of video on there right now and it says the estimated wait time is 30 minutes. Not too bad. And in actuality it will probably be closer to 20 minutes.- Sleek design: though external hard drive owners are probably more concerned with keeping their files safe, the design here will hopefully also appeal to the trendy-seekers too. I like the silver stripe and the overall look and feel. Definitely more attractive than my others.- Runs quiet/cool: doesn't make any hideous chugging sounds and doesn't get extremely hot. This is good news.- Good price. 3 TB isn't anything to laugh at, so I think this device is quite affordable given the amount of data it can holdCONS:- For Windows users, you will have to download software from their website for the computer to recognize the external hard drive. Honestly, I would rather have something without any software at all. I just want my files on there like a mega USB drive. But whatever, it isn't that big of a deal. For Mac users, you will be able to install the software directly after connecting it to your computer.OVERALL: As long as the drive doesn't crash on me, I can't really complain about it. Good amount of memory, good speed, quiet/cool, nice design. I have a few other Seagates and they seem to be a good brand. No issues. I'd recommend this one as well.

If your desk gets as dirty as mine, you'll understand why the first time you lose it)- Tracks get dirty quickly- Troubleshooting software requires a mouse -.-Overall, this is a great mouse, if only a little overpriced. But this is the only option, so I suppose Logitech would jack the price up a bit. If you're like me, and have been using this type of mouse since before you were potty trained, you'll want to get it. The range is about 15 feet, assuming no obstacles, and the response time is good enough for average gamers and home users. But really, if you're comparing response times, you should be going for a wired mouse (usually).Just a note on Logitech's support. I've had mixed experiences with Logitech's support, having been an original Revue owner. Recently though, I had to put in for the warranty on this device, as it was acting up and losing connection when it was used for long periods of time. Their support times were amazing, and after going through a few troubleshooting steps and giving them some personal info, they put in for a replacement.

B00752R9SM,great,How is the 3d rendering?,"This TV was very easy to set up; a one-person job to mount on a TV stand.  I use it with the Panasonic DMP-BDT220 3D Blue-ray DVD player and Panasonic SC-HTB 550 2.1 channel soundbar and like the results.  The color is stunning.  Family and friends comment about the depth of field and clarify and say that it looks like you are watching a live event.  The 3D is very nice.  The polarized glasses are light and comfortable, and again, I like the results.  I rarely use 3D or the up-conversion from 2D to 3D.  It works well enough, much short of 3D, but is interesting for format suitable to 3D.  However, I enjoy the regular 2D color so well I don't feel a need to change to quasi 3D.  So far I have stuck with the factory color settings and am satisfied.  I rarely use the Internet feature.  I find it very slow and clumsy.  But overall for the price, ease of use, and great color, I rated it a 5. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The 3D is very nice,"(353, 372)"

B00DR0PDNE,poor,How is the image quality like?,"UPDATE: After a bit of research, I found that if you change the quality from high def to standard before casting a browser video from you computer - the video on the TV is pretty smooth and the audio is in sync.Overall, I am happy with the quality and functionality of this feature after all.I already have a Roku and Tivo which can stream, so Chromecast doesn't offer much more functionality.What you do get from Chromecast is the ability to use a phone/tablet as the remote. As far as I see - this has to be why you want it.If you buy a chromecast and wish it came with a remote, then you should just buy a Roku or blu-ray player with wifi apps.The ability to navigate on a tablet and queue up shows on the TV is the main draw here.If you think about it - when you imagine a millionaire watching TV, the remote you picture is probably similar to a large smartphone or tablet, right? So Chromecast allows you to use your expensive smartphone to enhance the TV navigation experience.For that, I think the price is just right.Netflix and youtube worked well. I tried casting video from my computer chrome browser and it did not work well.Choppy, and it really had the computer working hard to stream the video.If they figure out how to get the Chromecast to stream directly from a URL rather than streaming through your computer - they would have a real valuable feature. That is why I got it, but really for $35 - its cool enough to keep. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the video on the TV is pretty smooth and the audio is in sync,"(149, 210)"

B000065BP9,tight,How is the headphone?,"After returning a more expensive but terrible set of headphones (ULTRASONE iCans-Okta S-Logic Surround Sound Portable Headphones) which were extremely uncomfortable and had a too-short cord, I bought the Sennheiser HD 202 which are perfect for my purpose.I bought these very recently to use with a boombox to listen (while sitting or lying down)to Hemi-Sync and other binaural beat CDs and tapes which produce alpha, theta, and delta states for meditation and exploration. My ears are very sensitve to any pressure on them, so I love that these Sennheisers have very soft, thick padding and that the ear phones wrap AROUND the ears - not against the ears. They have a long cord of about 10', so I can sit comfortably without feeling tugged and chained to the boombox. The sound is great for the price.Years ago I had an expensive set of Sennheisers to use with my stereo set, and loved them, but I was pleasantly surprised that these inexpensive ones are so nice for $20.17 (when I purchased them; prices fluctuate at Amazon).

B002JPITXY,incredible,What is the quality of the headphones?,"As an all out Zune owner, I have always enjoyed the devices and how they would update their devices with all the new features every year, including the old brick zunes. Since they weren't going to do it this time, I knew it was time to upgrade. I got a 32gb HD with no hesitation, there are a couple of things that you need to know about if you really want this compared to the Apple Ipod Touch.What I think is the best part about the Zune HD is its beautiful OLED screen. You don't know how beautiful a video or picture can look on a small device until you look at it on the Zune HD. The black quality on the screen is amazing and the colors are so vivid. Some of the features on the device is really helped out by the beautiful screen that this device possesses.Graphics: With a stripped down version of the nVidia Tegra chip inside the device, you can not go wrong. It has 8 processors making the device working at its best. It will definitely help once 3D games come to the device. Can't wait for that to happen!!!Software and Marketplace: The Zune software is...nice, could be better, could be worse. I like that it is customizable unlike Itunes. The marketplace is pretty, it could definitely have more videos and movies, but lets not forget that they just started with movies when the Zune HD came out. Still, many of the TV shows that I have like watching on CBS and FOX are NOT on the Zune Marketplace, which disappoints me. This can be apart of the review because this is the only software that the Zune is compatible with. Yes, its only on PC, its so sad that people with Macs can't use it, that 5-10% that can just use boot camp to use it. I mean seriously Mac users, get over it, YOU CAN USE IT!!! I have always like the wireless sync feature just in case I just don't want to find my sync cord you can just bring up the software and on the device just click wireless sync. Podcasts are handled on the Zune software. The catalog of podcasts are not as big on Itunes, but that is not such a big deal. What is great about it is that you can choose how many that you want to keep on your computer, so it automatically deletes on the ones that get old or outdated. You can also choose which ones to automatically sync to the device. Whether it be all of them, or just the ones that haven't been played yet and the ones that get played on the device get deleted after you watch.Apps: No store here. People who want a device for apps, its not here. The Zune HD has a very few simple games and only 2 applications. Microsoft has promised that they will be adding more to the catalog eventually, but its not here. The games and apps that they already for the device are nice to have. I always the Texas Hold 'Em game, simple but nice. The newest update allows 3D gaming which is great. Audiosurf Tilt is simply amazing with the screen. They are all free, thats a plus, but the catch is there are short advertisements before the games come up. Thats not such a big deal if you can get all of their stuff for free. I would much rather, though, pay for a valuable app from other developers. Microsoft has to keep with the times and allow other developers to create their own apps. Once Microsoft actually reads something from their reviewers and listens to them, they might get somewhere even further.UI: Beautiful, Microsoft was really working to create an interface for a touch device. They did a beautiful job at doing so. The searching for media on the device is so easy and very quick to learn. I absolutely LOVE the sidebar on the main screen. You just click on the left side of the main screen and this other screen comes up with ""Pins"", which are basically songs, pics, or videos that you like you can pin to the side bar so you can quickly access that when you turn it on. The next feature on that screen is history, which shows everything that you have been doing on the device like songs that you just recently listened to, podcasts, or websites that you view on the web browser. The last feature on that screen is ""New"" which shows the newest things that you recently added to the device so if you just added a song to the device, just go to the history screen and you can easily play the song without going through any menus. You can also delete ANYTHING that you want off your device by just clicking on the item. I know that the Ipod Touch does this, just not with everything.Music and features: Sound playback has always been the best on the Zune. They decided to bring the basic EQ back to the device, which is nice...just not nice enough. A customizable EQ would be great. You don't even need an EQ if you have the Zune premium headphones, with both of them together, it sounds amazing, Bose headphones, get out of the way (seriously)! I love the new music menu features on the Zune HD. First off, the artist menu is amazing. It starts off with the artists picture in the background and it has the basic albums and songs side menues, then theres artists pictures, which you can use as your background by the way, it also has a full bio of the artist on another side menu which is awesome, who wouldn't love to get a background of the artist. With the new firmware update now also there is underlined part in the bio which allows you to click on them, which is normally artists or other albums, and you can use the devices wi-fi directly from the bio and go to the artist or other album and download it with the on-device marketplace. Whats also included is related artists, which has a picture list of all the related artists which you can click on to either access their artist menu, or go to the on-device marketplace and download their stuff. What I think is the best is the screensaver mode when you are listening to songs. It really takes advantage of the screen. It starts after around 15 seconds on not touching the screen. The artist picture is in the background and the information from the screen is scrolling around the screen in all different directions, if you have used the Zune software, you might have seen this feature. Its just the icing on the cake. Microsoft really did try to get the music exploration aspect in Zune and they did a very good job.Videos: Simple enough...with the screen all the videos look beautiful. You can either choose since the device is widescreen to either keep the video at its full screen and have black sides or zoom in and make the video full screen. I love that you have the choice to do that. Colors really show up on this device so if you plan to watch an animated tv show like Family Guy, you can actually tell what color the wall in the background is.Zune Pass: Genius...$15 a month for unlimited streaming of songs and you get to keep 10 of those songs each month. So if you compare it to Itunes...10 songs for $1.29, you spend $13 on 10 songs that you get to keep and that means you get unlimited streaming to millions of songs for just $2 a month. What a bargain!!! You also get the the Zune Pass with the On-device marketplace. You can download songs to the device right from the online device marketplace and even when you get offline, you can still continue listening to it. I love the zune pass and its definitely worth it if you love music.On-Device Markeplace - Very nice to have, especially if you have the Zune Pass. They also have the very few apps on the marketplace and you can download updates right from the marketplace, but there hasn't been any updates to the 7 games that Microsoft supplies.Pictures: Beautiful, scrolling to the next picture and rendering the picture from horizontal to landscape takes not time. It uses the same multi-touch feature to zoom and is quite useful. Overall...nice.Radio: This is one of Microsoft's selling points. This radio is FM AND HD radio. Too bad I don't live near any main radio station that include HD radio stations. I don't really see any improvements in the radio either. When I go to the city, I will let you guys know. What I have always loved about the radio is the tag to FM feature, which is when you get a clear enough reception, it will show the title of the radio station and the song that is playing currently. You can tag that song and add it to your cart which you can download with the marketplace. That is a great way to get introduced and familiar with new music.Social: Still evolving...not there yet. I am so sad that they took away the song and podcast sharing from zune to zune wirelessly. Its gone, now there is a way to send songs with an email address or zune tag (or xbox live gamertag) when you plug your zune back into the computer. What they did do is add your zune inbox if your account is synced with your device, and it displays on your device...which is nice. But it is still sad that they took away the wireless song sharing feature. (It still works with the older models if you still have one!)Internet browser: OK...not as good as the Ipod Touch safari browser. There is no flash...yet. But you get the choice to either use the internet browser as a mobile browser or you can view sites in their desktop format, its a choice in the internet settings menu. The keyboard is small, but isn't every PMP keyboard? The added auto-correct features with the new firmware update, but it is still not as good as safari.This was a complete and honest review. I love Zune and I have always thought about going back to Ipod, but Zune keeps coming out with new devices that can not be refused. Music and video playback and exploration...Zune is the one and only way to go. No other device does it as good as Zune. Applications and web browsing are better for the Ipod people. Unlimited streaming of music and keeping 10 songs a month, go Zune. Paying individual songs at $1.29 a month to keep forever, go with Ipod. There are so many things that I listed on here and probably a couple of other things that would affect your decision. But I hope that this helped.5/17 update...1. the newest zune update got rid of all of the advertisements before the apps started2. There are now around 20 apps for the HD including facebook and twitter...still nothing special. Let's just hope the the Windows 7 series phones apps will be compatible.3. CBS and FOX have both been added to the Zune Marketplace4. They have added the Smart DJ feature to the HD device (like Genius on the ipod, but actually gets better results)5. Direct Xvid compatibility...you don't know how much better that made this thing. Makes the Zune way more compatible that now you can directly add .avi files without converting first.6. Internet browser got better, faster tilt sensitivity and faster overall experience. You can take snapshots of what is on the screen while surfing and save it to the device in pictures.

B000S5Q9CA,good,Is this phome comes with a charger?,"I've only been using this charger for a week, but in that time I've had no issues with it.  I mention this because I have heard that accessories like this tend to work great in the beginning and then die suddenly after 2 months, and I also plan to follow up on the review.  For now, I will say that this charger is great.  It is designed really well and tastefully- the black and silver look sleek and the illuminated blue ""M"" is beyond nice.  The quality of the materials exceeded my expectations- it's not cheap or flimsy feeling at all.  I use it to charge my HTC Incredible 2, and it does so quickly and without problems.  The cord is a comfortable length and the coil keeps it from becoming an annoyance.  Love it so far!**Update:  After 3 months of daily use, I've run into a problem.

B005EJH6RW,good,How is the grip?,"The AmazonBasics 3-Button mouse connects to and works flawlessly with a Mac out of the box. The texture is very nice, a silky feel you don't expect from plastics. Tracking across the screen is super fast, so much so that I had to turn down tracking speed in my settings. For years I've been using the standardApple Optical Mouse, which works fine for my purposes and feels great. We have had an issue with a few over the years that have developed a fault, however: when you lift the mouse off the mouse pad (or whatever surface you're using) the cursor starts jumping around on the screen. There's no telling, of course, whether the AmazonBasics mouse will develop a similar defect after extensive use. I do prefer the Apple mouse for two reasons: it's a bit heavier, and the shape feels more natural to me. I'm sure that it wouldn't take long to get used to the feel of the Amazon mouse, however. As with theAmazonBasics Wired KeyboardI recently reviewed, Amazon's mouse offers a decent to Apple's more expensive product. ANSWERNOTFOUND",and the shape feels more natural to me,"(768, 806)"

I received the keyboard in the expected time frame and the unit looked new.  Missing was the extender, batteries and documentation.  No real issue, however my problem is that this keyboard clearly was not tested.I saw a reference to having to hit the keys squarely in the middle for them to work, I saw another where the ""c"" key didn't work.

B0049YQVHE,real,What is winner?,"This ASUS router is a very attractive piece of electronic hardware, with its black diamond embossed plastic case.  It is also very fast.  I clocked it at 57.2Mbps and in the range test, it offered 34.4Mbs.  That was at the 2.4 GHz.  At 5 GHz, it clocked out at 112.6Mbps.  At this speed, I can blast through 500MB of data in just around 30 seconds.  If that is not the fastest router out there, it certainly is in the top few.  When I increased the range to 100 feet, the router still scored 76.1Mbps.However, on the downside, it does not provide a guest network on either its 2.4GHz or 5GHz radios.  I am used to having this feature so when my guests arrive, they do not have access to the files on my computer.  I am not sure why they left this feature out of this router.  Perhaps it is because it has 2 USB ports on this very thin router (to support both a printer and an attached storage device) and support for WDS bridging (you can turn off its router function and use it as a wireless bridge). Alternatively, you can configure the router as a wireless access point.  This paper-thin looks just fine on its stand, but it can just as easily lie flat as a pancake on a shelf or on my desk with its ports facing the wall.Set-up of this ASUS router was quick and easy.  I did not even use the installation CD that came in the box.  I simply used my internet browser (Chrome) and went to 192.168.1.1 and it guided me through a very easy and intuitive set-up procedure.  This Disk-Aid feature also has some other features like setting up a FREE Dynamic DNS address.  I simply had to go to the Disk-Aid and pick a unique name and then after three mouse clicks the service is up and running. After that, I can remotely access the router via the Web address:  xyz.asuscomm.com, where xyz is the unique name I picked out.  This router also supports media streaming and can stream digital content stored on the external hard drive to UPnP-compliant network media streamers.This is a heck of a router for the price.  I looked at the Cisco models and they were much more expensive for the same features (sans the guest network feature).  Nevertheless, even with that omission, this is a great deal for the power, performance and range I get with this router. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This ASUS router is,"(0, 19)"
B004N866SA,thin,How is it bezel?,"The picture quality, colors, contrast and clarity of this television is nothing short of jaw dropping; just amazing really, especially since we upgraded from a 15 year old CRT-TV. It took us a while to get the thing set up, entering account info and registering for the various services but connecting to my wireless network was relatively simple and the TV downloaded an important update right after initial connection was made. Pairing the remote required that I hold the remote pretty close to the hot spot on the lower right corner of the TV but once paired, it worked flawlessly. My Time Warner cable remote however, still is not properly synched and connected to my new Samsung components so I may need to call Time Warner on this; the synch codes I used and the auto synch process did not fully work.Netflix is not what it used to be; the service seems to have only older movies and not the 'just released' films. This, along with nearly intolerable rebuffering pauses and an annoying black flash blip which happens every 3 mins or so makes me wonder if Netflix is really worth the subscription fee anymore. I ordered a new Apple Airport Extreme to upgrade to the new dual band technology so I am hoping that this fixes this rebuffering and drop out problems otherwise it is not likely that I will go past the free trial of Netflix. Blu-rays and DVDs look fantastic on this TV played on my new Samsung BD-D5500. The TV automatically connects to the Blu-Ray and switches ports when you turn it on. Cool.You need to play with the settings on the TV before you know what you like in terms of picture and sound. I was very impressed with the built-in sound of this TV, clearly upgraded over previous models, but I picked up an audio Y-cable and connected the TV directly to my stereo receiver's tape deck 'in' port and now when I activate the receiver's 'Tape' button, I get crystal clear stereo sound to go with my amazing picture. Even though this system supports surround sound 5.1 I am not missing it. The 3D features of this TV are mind-blowing but it does give you a headache after a while; you can sense the flicker of the battery powered glasses. Not all 3D discs are equal, some are a let-down and despite the hype, you likely won't end up watching 3D programming very often. The 3D starter kit comes with 2 pair of glasses and there's a coupon to get two more pair for free by mail so at least it's not too expensive for everyone to get the taste of 3D when they want it. The 2D picture though is beyond incredible. The bezel is unbelievably thin and the TV itself is very very thin and relatively lightweight. Stand is heavy and stable; ports are clearly marked but there is very little room to plug in the HDMI cables at back, especially since the pro cable I got for the Blu-Ray has a magnetic shield barrel on the cable and this presses against the back of the TV and seems to slightly bend the port so it is better to use HDMI cables that lay flat.The Samsung apps work pretty well but they are clearly still young and need development. I spent nearly two years researching TVs and am very happy I got this Smart-TV model. Dynamic LED backlighting was a key feature for me, there is absolutely no flashlighting or ghosting, blacks are deep and solid. This is surely one of the best TVs out there right now and I would whole-heartedly recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The bezel is unbelievably thin and the TV itself is very very thin,"(2529, 2595)"

B0074BW614,comparable,How is the price?,"AWESOME, INCREDIBLE, Any other positive you can think of.  I have been thinking about getting a tablet for each of my daughters and have been reading reviews and checking out every device I can get my hands on.  I know I didn't want the el-cheepo tablets you can get for $99.  I've seen those and checked them out and they are tablets, but generally have older operating system, lack support, and don't support all the apps.  I didn't want a limited device.  I also didn't want to spend $350 per device either.  I have heard of people that got the Kindles and were very happy with them so I decided to take a chance and get 2 of them.  For the price of the refurb devices, with a percentage off e-coupon that I had, plus using my amazon points from my Amazon credit card, I was able to basically get 2 of these for the price of one.  I set my expectations a bit low because I didn't think of them as full tablets, but I'm happy to report I was rather wrong in that area.  I was very, very impressed with the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  I have a full 10 inch Acer Iconia tablet that I like and my kids like but it's a bit large for them.  This is the perfect size and feels so good in the hands.  The screen is very clear, and the sound these things produce is just amazing.  I couldn't believe how amazing the sound on these is, and how loud!  My kids are getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to see their jaws hit the ground!  Amazon uses a custom interface for the Android OS, but it doesn't make it any less functional. It is a bit different getting used to compared with the standard Android interface, but it works fine.  It was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with it.  Once you get used to the different interface, it's just as easy to get around in it as anything else, and if it's your first exposure to the world of tablet devices, I think it would be much easier to learn and get comfortable with.  I can't be happier with these things and actually, even though I have a 10 inch tablet, I'm very much considering getting one of these for me too.  I like it that much.Now, as for the refurbished part, don't be afraid of that word.  I get refurb stuff all the time and so far, here's what my experience is... they are great!  It seems like the refurb items have had all the bugs worked out and have had more rigorous testing than the new devices.  I've had plenty of new things stop working on me and had to get them replaced or repaired, but I've never had one single refurb device have any issue at all... ever (knock on wood!!).  These had no signs of ever having been used.  Not one single scratch or blemish, and Amazon's support is growing to be legend.  They want people to be happy with their purchases and will go the extra mile to ensure you are, so the support they offer is very good.I guess the bottom line is, if you are looking to get a tablet to start into the tablet world, or want something for the kids, then you have to consider this.  The price is excellent and it's a great tablet.  You won't be dissapointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The price is excellent,"(2991, 3013)"
B001G1ZPV6,comfortable,What do you think about grip?,"I use this with my Nikon D7000 and an off label battery.  This grip fits perfect, feels good in your hands, is exactly compatible with my camera, and looks just like the Nikon grip.  The wheel that you use to tighten works fine, but you can jiggle it back and forth.  This does not affect how it fits at all.  It doesn't mean that the grip is coming loose, its just how it is. It comes with an optional insert for AA batteries if you don't happen to have a second lithium battery charged.  I also like how it has the shutter button, AE-L/FE-L button, and front and rear dials as well as directional buttons to control the menus while the camera is vertical.I honestly did not know if it would be a fully compatible grip for that price but I was pleasantly surprised.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quality yet inexpensive grip.  It really gives your camera a professional look. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This grip fits perfect,"(58, 80)"

On my work station I have many cables and devices.. and if this cable was more flexible I would have a better chance of hiding it.For the price and how well it works I do feel this is a great buy.

B004MYFOE2,straightforward,How do you like the installation?,"I have an AMD FX-8120 8-Core Black Edition and the stock fan was noisy and not very effective. I mainly play Black Ops 2 and I was starting to worry about overheating from a few hours worth of game play. Part of it has to do with your ambient room temperature, but that fan just couldn't keep up.This liquid cooler was easy to install, looks great, and was very affordable. The mounting is likely to be more solid than the standard flip down lever because you are able to tighten with thumb screws on an AMD board. You do want to tighten them down a little at a time so you don't have one side lifted or put more pressure on one side than the other.Others said that the instructions were poor but I didn't have any issues following. It was easier to assemble than anything I have gotten from IKEA and that stuff is usually easy to assemble.I would buy again and for sure recommend it to anyone that wants to protect their investment.

B000089GN3,unbelievable,How is the sound?,"I am comparing these headphones to other products people may be interested in.Shure SE110Apple Ear BudsSeinnheiser HD280sSony EX71Skullcandy Ink'dPros:More comfortable than ear buds or closed headsetsExtremely portableInexpensiveExcellent sound quality (recessed mids but excellent balance and richness for the most part)Can hear the outside worldCons:Can hear the outside world, and they can hear youReally need to be broken in for the sound quality to go from amazing to exquisiteOn their own, the PX 100 headphones are extremely comfortable, fit well, collapse for portability, and sound amazing. They are relatively inexpensive and have a beautiful warm, boomy sound that was absolutely shocking when I first put them on. They are the best sounding headphones I have that I can wear comfortably.These headphones have very similar sound quality to the HD280s but tend to make music more enjoyable. While the 280s are more analytical and balanced, the px 100s are more colorful and have more bass. They also do not highlight the highs so much that poor quality audio files are impossible to listen to. These headphones have half the impedance of the 280s which means you are getting richer sound in a more portable package for half the cost- with increased battery life on portables.SE110s are slightly clearer and allow individual instrumentation to be heard better, but their sound quality does not create a balance (favoring the highs) that makes music enjoyable. They are also not comfortable. Both are good for classical music but I think the PX 100s are better because of their warm sound and deep lows, which really brings crescendos to a climactic finish where SE110s always leave the listener feeling cheated out of the final hit.These have the same depth of bass response as the Sony 71s, but are more clear and are not as muddy in the mids and highs.They are about as clear in the highs as apple ear buds (they are better than most people want to think) but also allow for clear bass and do not sound tinny and like someone pushed the right side of an equalizer to max.The Ink'd ear buds are the closest in terms of overall sound to these and cost only a third of what the the PX 100s cost, but are less comfortable, do not stay in your ear, translate the sound of the cord, and only sometimes sound right (you have to have a perfect fit, which is nigh impossible)These are my favorite pair and I only put them away when I *must* be isolated from my environment. They have an amazingly rich, warm sound which adequately plays any music I can throw at it. The clarity in the upper range with older music can lend to the bass overpowering some music. It isn't as noticeable as it is when my Klipsch 2.1 system plays the same song.These are a no-brainer and I liked them more than the KSC75s, portapros, and bose triports I tried.

This drive is fast enough with a generous 3TB which is what I wanted for the internal storage to our family computer. I do some fairly intense video editing with Final Cut using this drive as both the system drive and the scratch disks and saw very little lag in.One concern I'd heard with some of the other high capacity drives inside iMacs is that they are too loud, so the sound levels was probably my biggest concern.  After several months of all kinds of use I have yet to ever even hear the drive doing anything.  Phew!Its a great drive and I got it for a great price! ANSWERNOTFOUND",very little lag in,"(346, 364)"
B005HMO6A6,good,How is the texture?,"For my tablets, I wanted to find a way to reduce clutter but still be able to lug around my gear. I don't need to have my bluetooth keyboard with me all the time, but when I do, this case/keyboard combo was exactly what I was looking for. It does a good job of holding my iPad in place and still has a very slim profile when everything is put together. I was actually pretty surprised by how slim this case/keyboard was when folded up. The keyboard was easy to setup and connect and the fact that you can adjust, remove, or separate the iPad case from the keyboard is great. The price point is decent ($50-$60) and although the construction is a little ""plasticky"", it does what you'd want it to do. There are a little kinks to work out like how stiff the hinge actually is, how protective the actual case is, and how firm the case holds for typing.Pros:-Case/keyboard combo with very slim profile-Adjustable hinge for angle adjustment of iPad-iPad swivels for portrait or landscape typing-Easy bluetooth keyboard setup and connectionCons:-Little too ""plasticky""-Probably not as protective as a dedicated case-Keyboard is smaller and takes some time to get used to-iPad isn't rock-steady when typing unless you place it in the keyboard's notchtldr; good case/keyboard combo but needs more protection and improvements to be prefect ANSWERNOTFOUND",decent,"(594, 600)"

B001F51G16,solid,What is the best design?,"I purchased this keyboard to replace the previous unit because it was way too loud.  More accurately, my better half had me replace my previous keyboard because it was way too loud.  The design is nice, clean and minimal without sacrificing functionality.  And it is indeed very quiet.  Drivers installed automatically when I inserted the disc into the drive and everything appears to be working great.  I was also pleasantly surprised by how thin the unit is.  All in all, very happy with the purchase.  The only negative thing I have to say is that the box used to ship the keyboard in was way too long for the packaging.  While the shipping boxes width and depth seemed appropriate, it was about four feet long. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The design is nice,"(183, 201)"

Just like before the mout came with all the needed hardware includingn some thick plastic washers to allow me to attach the straight vertical bracket to a rounded backside of the the TV. The mount is so thin that I barely have 1 1/2 inches between the wall and the back of the TV. It's close enough that its difficult to plug any wires into the back of the TV after it's hung.The construction is solid. The thick wood scres wit tight in the wall's 2x4 (make sure you have a studfinder or are willing to drill some scout holes).

B005HMO6A6,functional,How is the keyboard?,"I've been using the product to type up my notes during class, and it is perfect!For my first few years, I had been carrying my macbook pro around for class.This was fine when I literally lived in the school. For the last two years, I had to move into an apartment with a 15 minute walk to the school building.Carrying a 15 inch laptop, though much smaller than the competition, was still quite heavy with all my books. I turned to the ipad to be both my computer and etextbook reader. The only problem I had was with using my ipad to type in class. The keyboard was not good for fast typing.However, with the IMP38B, I have the best of both worlds in a small package!The keys are a comfortable familiar size, needing no getting used to time.The case and keyboard also have a matte finish. While minute, it is perfect for oily finger days.The only thing I don't like, is if I touch the swivel mount, or bump the ipad/keyboard to hard, the swivel mount does move a bit, requiring some readjusting.For the price, this keybaord is PERFECT and WELL worth the money!

I love that I can rockbox this player and that it accepts .flac and so many other file formats. The sounds quality is excellent and I wouldn't want a player smaller than this. If you add a 32gb microsd card, then you have a 36 gigabyte mp3 player that's the size of a matchbox for 1/3 the price of most players. I love this little guy. The only real gripe is that it might not have the durability of some of the other players out there and the screen is tiny. Other than that, i'm in love!

B002WE6D44,more,What is the price?,"I'm glad I went for this 32 gb, class 10 card when I bought my new camera. It works great, it's fast, it has a lot of room on it... I feel like it's going to be quite a while before I even need to move videos and photos off of the card to make room for more. I have other Transcend SD cards in smaller sizes and those work great too. The price on this card is definitely better than I could find for other brands of the same size, as well.Update (07/13/12):I found a problem with this card if you're using it in a DSLR for video. I have a Canon T3i and when I shoot video sometimes (well, probably more than half of the time) it will stop recording either within seconds of hitting record or a couple minutes later. I did a search online and what it seems to be is when you go back through your card and delete certain photos or videos that aren't at the end of the sequence it leaves gaps in the memory, then when you record a video it tries to fill those gaps before continuing at the end of the memory card. Basically, I have to save everything to my computer and format my memory card while it's in my camera before doing any video shoots to make sure this doesn't happen. It seems to work fine if I do that. In theory, if you don't delete anything that's not at the end of the number sequence, it should work fine as long as you have room, but I don't always look at each picture and decide whether or not to delete it before taking another. I have read that this isn't an issue with some other brands like San Disk, but haven't tried for myself. I also don't know if this only happens with certain cameras.This is the only problem I've had with this memory card and for everything else, it works great.

I take it both hiking and scuba diving (have the case).  It is easy to use.  Like all items, I recommend reading the manual.  Yes, I said read the book!  The camera is lightweight and requires a steady hand.  The biggest mistake I made with the camera is snapping the picture and moving the camera right after it.  Give it a second to record the image.  It is pretty fast, but if you are use to a film camera, you will end up blurring some of the pictures.  I plan to get another one just to have as a spare.  It's that good.

B0074BW614,small,How is laptop?,"Let me begin this by saying that I used to be an ""early adopter"".  I had to have it when it first came out.  I've stopped doing that, but in this case I wish I had bought the first Fire.  From using a friend's I was excited when they finally announced the second gen devices.  The original was simple to use and did most things I wanted it to.  This one is incredibly hard to figure out, even with years of techy experience and is more limited in its use.PROS -Feels solid and well built.Anti-glare screen is nice, and the screen is vibrant.  It's not Retina, but then it didn't cost like one so I'm OK with that.Some have reported it being slow and unresponsive, but I haven't had much of a problem except when in apps I know have problems from them doing the same to my phone.  Videos streamed from Amazon look really good.Book reading is surprisingly good for a backlit screen.  Page turns are quick and although they lack the book like ""charm"" of the Kindle reader page turns it is an acceptable substitute.Screen brightness is good and you can see the screen pretty well outdoors.  I have turned off automatic screen brightness though.  I find the values it chooses too bright in most cases and have mine set slightly less than 50%.CONS -No AC adapter included.  Would that have really been that much of a stretch to include?No flash support.  UPDATE: Well...no official flash support.  Thanks to the comment from TomT below I was able to install both flash and my preferred browser (Dolphin) in a few minutes.  Google Flash 11.1 apk and follow the xda developer links...will walk you right through it.  Now if I can get Google Voice working so I can use sonar I'll be a happy camper.  Have added a star since it was this easy.  That still doesn't negate the fact that it should have been included in the first place with so many sites still using Flash.The charge and HDMI ports are on the long edge rather than the short as is on my other Kindles (and the original Fire I believe).  When you want to do HDMI out to a TV you can only turn it one way if you want to tilt it up which may, depending on the case you buy,  totally defeat the stand in the case.  In the case of the Marware leather rotating case you can't close the case when charging because the ports are to the inside.Volume and On-Off buttons are flush with the case and almost impossible to find by feel.  Since the only visual cue for which way you are holding it is the camera lens this makes it difficult in a darkened room.No GPS.  This isn't a deal breaker, but would have been nice.  I suppose they thought since it needs wireless people wouldn't use it like that, but I could always turn on my phone's Mobile Hotspot to use Google maps IF I had a GPS.The ads.  I own other Kindles and have never felt the need to turn them off.  They were unobtrusive and didn't really affect my use of the device.  I even went for them occasionally.  The ones on the new Kindle are ridiculous.  Everywhere you turn they are in your face just waiting for an errant touch to purchase something you don't mean to and taking up screen space. People who care for children or the elderly should be extra vigilant for unintended purchases.Lack of many apps in the app store that I use daily on my Android phone and would use on the Kindle if they were there.  It's clear Amazon doesn't want to take any chances that you might stream something online that doesn't belong to them.  No TNT app, no USA app, no CW app.  I assume the others that I don't use like HBO and Showtime aren't there either?  No support for PowerDVD Remote and PowerDVD Mobile which would allow me to stream my own personal videos from my network rather than having to either upload them to the cloud or onto the device.  Can't access my Dropbox either.  I use my phone as a remote constantly when streaming from my HTPC to my TV and I was hoping I could use the Kindle that way too.Apps that work perfectly well on my phone throw error after error on the Kindle's ""special"" version. Examples: Words with Friends, no paid version and ads lock up the device.  Tweetcaster constantly throws the 350 connections per hour message and I am not a heavy user.  It throws this one when all I do is check it once in a while and have it set on manual refresh.  I ended up in Twitter Jail the first night I had the Kindle and I didn't tweet a single thing!  Never had this happen on my phone.Every app you download results in a ""purchase"" email from Amazon...even the free ones.  I have an avalanche of them in my inbox just from setting it up.  (Yes, I know this happens for phones as well.  I make the comment to point it out to those that don't know.  Amazon should have a better way worked out to handle this by now and since Kindle is part of their proprietary environment and since Kindle is a part of that this is part of owning one.)The Carousel? I hate it.  Everything goes on it as soon as you load or use it even if you don't want it to.  There may be a way to fine tune this, but if there is I haven't found it yet. I put a few favorite songs on the device for when I'm not near wireless and it showed each individual song on the Carousel. The UI is cluttered and as far as I can see there is no way to alter it to better serve your personal needs.  No way to clear the Carousel either.  You have to remove items one by one.  (If anyone knows how to change this please do let me know.)The main screen is obviously front loaded to get you to buy stuff..with the few things things that get around the spoon feeding of ads and buying stuff all the way to the right like photos and web.UPDATE:  I had not attempted to use the camera.  There is no software included to make use of the camera.  The User guide says you can download Skype and that it MAY work with other apps in the store, but there is no way to use it without downloading something and experimentation to see what apps might work with it.  Why include the camera if they aren't going to give you something to help use it?No alarm clock app included.  Now I know there are apps that will do this, but it's pretty much a basic inclusion on most mobile devices these days.Haven't decided if I will return or wait and hope Amazon offers some software updates that make it more acceptable.  It's a brilliant hardware upgrade hogtied by Amazon's watered-down version of Android and the lack of basic apps like camera/alarm that we have all come to expect.  I haven't tested the HDMI out yet, since my micro-HDMI cable hasn't arrived yet.  Will update this review next week when I get that. ANSWERNOTFOUND",camper buttons unobtrusive,"(1682, 2829)"

B000VW6KXS,small,How is the compartment?,"Really love this backpack from Kata. Previously, I only had experience with chain store backpacks but the DR-467 is a cut above. It has tons of features, superb build quality, and excellent padding. Exterior is somewhat anonymous however this is a plus for me as I sometimes travel through dodgy areas and need a backpack that doesn't attract unwanted attention.It is compact, reasonably light-weight and has a slim profile. The bright yellow interior lining is very helpful for finding gear in low light. Has lots of pockets for organization. Laptop section fits my 17"" just fine. Back padding is a little stiff. Lower gear compartment is attached by Velcro and can be completely pulled out. Compact size is not suitable for giant gear or very long lenses but medium zoom and primes should be fine. Top compartment is very roomy and has a slot to poke mp3 player headphones through.Straps are very comfy. Zippers have smooth travel. Reflective cloth is embedded in zippers and straps. Rain cover is a nice plus as is zip out drink holder. The only complaint I have is no tripod holder and would like a dedicated keychain hook.

B002C7481G,fast,How is device?,"Hi,I am technical director at a software company. It has been a long time ago since I did my last programming, and nowadays I am doing mostly Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations and Pdf document reading. Why all MS Office an Pdf ? Because 100% of our customers and suppliers use it.I like the iPad because I am truly a gadget fan, and I wanted to study its application to real business.My conclusion is that the software which is available for the iPad is still not mature, even tough the concept derives from the ipod/iphone, which have been around for a while now.From a hardware point of view, the device is quasi-perfect. Performance is great, size is OK (albeit I would prefer 16:9) and technological concepts behind the interface are very good. But again, almost everything is inherited from the ipod touch and the iphone. So from the hardware point of view, it is nothing revolutionary. An USB port would be a real plus.From the software point of view, there is much that needs to be worked out:The Numbers appliction, doesn't save files in Excel format, doesn't let fou open/save spredsheets from ""internet disks"" (WebDav Servers), with the exception of [...], which is really used for sharing documents and doesn't allow editing. So for working with Excel spreadsheets and sharing information for editing on the move with your co-workers, the Numbers application is useless.The Keynote app has exactly the same problem. No saving in Powerpoint format and no way of sharing the files for editing with your co-workers.The Pages app better, since it can save in Word format, but still no access to ""internet disks"".There are other offerings for MS Office compatible Suites, but I have evaluated 2 of them and both have big problems saving the spreadsheets, loosing the format and formulas when doing so. Result: Useless with the spreadsheets I use daily.The Mail Application is good enough, even tough you cannot send multi file attachments, so you will have to send the attachments one by one.The Browser will not render flash content. Until HTML5 becomes a widespread standard, this is also a minus, since flash is sometimes required for my business research.And as the last issue, there is not real printing support. Sure, there are some apps out there, but most of them uses ""tricks"" to print entire documents (like using a master pc for example: not really mobile).The iBooks application works very well if you are capable of converting pdf docs to the iPad format. Now I can read 500 pages technical specs on my couch instead od sitting endless hours sitting in front of my laptop (alltough I could use my laptop on the couch, believe me it is not really confortable).So my perception is that it will take some time until the available software matures enough, so that the device is ready for use in real business.As a home use gadget, it is a very interesting and promising device. But be aware: It is an ipod with a larger screen, which has it's advantages, since it can be used for tasks for which the ipod was not well suited to.As the time goes by, I will do more tests and post my findings ANSWERNOTFOUND",it is a very interesting and promising device,"(2873, 2918)"
B002IKLJU0,many,How is setting?,"It looks like this model is phasing out anyway, but this is just a word to the obsessive shoppers who are spending countless hours examining reviews and painstakingly weighing the differences between this and the FZ40 (as I did)...Many people have said that the FZ35 images have less noise than the FZ40. That may be true, but the FZ35 is still pretty noisy, even at low ISO's, so the difference is probably minimal. They are sharp, detailed and well-exposed, but the grain is noticeable at larger sizes...doesn't even compete with a first generation Canon Rebel on that front. So don't think the choice is between a camera with minimal noise and another with a lot of noise; neither of them is stellar. If I were to make the decision again, I would go with the FZ40 because of the improved features and increased zoom.Other than that, it's still a great camera and I use it all the time. The zoom, compactness, and fantastic video implementation are wonderful. Just don't pixel-peep at 100% or you'll be disappointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND",obsessive shoppers,"(79, 97)"
B003DZ165W,hard,Is the cover hard?,"I have really been enjoying my lighted cover for my Kindle. Before I bought it, I read some other reviewers that suggested using the elastic band to bind back the cover when reading. As in, open the cover all the way until it touches the back cover and flip the band around it to hold it there. This works great. The cover is nice and stiff which seems to provide good protection. The light, for me, works really great. It is really convenient not having to have a separate light and/or batteries. Some reviewers have complained about the included LED light being unevenly distributed. This is true, but mine doesn't seem to be in any way that bad. I played with the light (it slides out on a molded flat plastic arm in the top right hand corner of the back), and see that if the light is angled just a little bit more down or up it changes the light distribution considerably. Which leads me to wonder if the lights that are giving the most problems are just off-angled. Anyway, it is just a thought. Oh, and I love the detail for the band, meaning the sliding leather tab which assists in locking the cover open/closed.

B002J9HBIO,extra,Does the camera glove has no extra pockets?,"On my old laptop bag, the handles started coming apart so I was looking for a new one. I wanted something a little smaller that still had a front pocket for extras such as an iPod, the laptop power cord, a small external hard drive, and a couple cables. This case was in my price range and is well reviewed. The very first review and a few others I read mentioned that this bag was a little small and potentially a tight fit. I have a Lenovo e420 14"" laptop and decided to buy the 16"" bag so I would have a little extra room.When the case arrived the first thing I noticed is the bag is very slim. My 14"" Lenovo e420 fits comfortably in the bag leaving a little extra room so it does not scrape the zipper. If I had gone with the 14"" bag I have no doubts that there would have been issues with the laptop rubbing on the zipper. I have enough extra room to put a manila folder with some paperwork in the pocket along with the laptop itself. The second/middle zipper has several pockets inside that are good for storing small things. In my case, some SD cards and thumb drives. In front of those small pockets there is room for the laptop power cord, a small usb external hard drive, my iPod Classic, and a couple small misc cables. With all those items it makes the pocket a little bulgy and doesn't leave much room for anything else. The very front zippered pocket on the bag is really tiny. I have a cellphone charger in it and that is a very snug fit by itself.Honestly had I known the bag was practically a notebook sleeve with a front pocket I probably would've opted for a different bag. That being said I'm going to use this one for awhile and see if it grows on me. I like that the bag is smaller than my old one and that its very lightweight material. It feels like it will provide some decent protection and the material of the bag itself won't damage or scratch my belongings inside it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",those small pockets,"(1088, 1107)"

B001OMGVII,important,What is the importance of that feature to you?,"The functions of the 855 are great.I like being able to replace the battery when the original wears out eventually since it's much cheaper to replace than sending a unit to Garmin for battery replacement.The custom avoidance feature is a nice function not found in many other Garmin GPSs.  You can save avoidance instances to certain roads or areas you don't want to travel through.Ease of use is great similar to my 760 I had given to someone.The lane assist is nice.The junction view where it shows exit signs has very few exits in the unit, maybe they will add more in the future.Only main con I would say is an occaisional hang of the GPS and I have to hold the power button for a while and then it does a full reboot.Also the voice recognition does not respond sometimes, but it's still a great feature to have.Hopefully these will be ironed out in a future firmware upgrade.

B007B31IAK,good,How good is the finish?,The case fits nicely on to the iPad mini. At first one corner wouldn't fasten but with a little pressing it fit and stays on. The flexible front cover is surprisingly durable and provides a good handhold either open or folded back. I would prefer if there were a band to aid in holding but the case is otherwise satisfactory. I'm not sure how much protection it would provide if the device was dropped but it offers a better grip than the slick iPad and so makes it less likely that it will be dropped. It's also less bulky than other cases I looked at.My only complaint is that they describe shipping weight as 0.3 ounces which is a complete fabrication. The case itself weighs 5 ounces. Shipping weight does not mean the weight of the packaging! Amazon seems not to care that many merchants on its site provide this same fraudulent information. ANSWERNOTFOUND,The flexible front cover is surprisingly durable and provides a good handhold either open or folded back,"(126, 230)"
B000F28DP2,poor,What did you think of the modem signal?,"Three years ago I bought a Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 and it still is working well.  Two months ago I needed another, but I saw this Channel Master model ant it was cheaper than the Motorola and included the splitter.  Channel Master is a brand that I learned to trust, but two months later it doesn't work anymore.  I found out by disconnecting it and putting the splitter that it replaced back in.  The signal strength was stronger with the splitter than with the amplifier.  I bought another Motorola Signal Booster 484095-001-00 and ran it through the old splitter and this works better than the Channel Master ever did.  Maybe you get what you pay for?  Maybe just bad luck?  I'll stick with Motorola for now. ANSWERNOTFOUND",it still is working well .,"(69, 94)"
B0009GZSSO,excellent,What do you think about detail?,"I bought this camera based on some of the reviews and because I didn't want to shell out $1000 for an DSLR. I got it home and started playing with it.Sure, it's a decent camera, but it was obvious that I would eventually want to upgrade to an DSLR.All things considered, there are a couple of ways to think about this camera:One is that it is a relative bargain for what it offers. High resolution, relatively fast shooting speed (compared to other point and shoot cameras), high quality video capability (amazingly good), image stabilized lens (low light shots were still blurry), 12X zoom, macro capability in an all-in-one package. You don't really need any addons except for more memory and a case.The other side is that it is expensive. $450-500 is expensive for anything, and this camera is no exception.For me, I believed the latter. Since I was spending $500, why not  spend a few hundred more (ok 500 more) and just get the Digital Rebel XT?Anyway, after battling the 2 sides for a day or so, I returned the camera and bought the digital rebel XT. My advice is to definitely go for the DSLR, they are in different leagues.The S2 performed poorly in low light. It has an overly complex menu system. The DSLR has more buttons. I like buttons. They are much more accessible than a nested menu system.The S2 was slow, offering 1.5 fps (max) while my DSLR has 3 fps. I found the wait to take my next shot with the S2 agonizingly slow, with the flash much longer.Strangely, the S2 has a lens cap that just won't stay on. Perhaps one of the weakest aspects of the camera. I was holding the camera still, and the cap just slid off to the floor. Be prepared to lose the cap eventually.The S2 has a cheap plastic silver look to it. It looks like the ""flavor of the month"". I'm not sure why so many electronics are plastic silver. Guess it's the trend. I'd much rather have black. I believe the S2 is as heavy as or even heavier than the Digital Rebel XT.Bottom line is the camera may be one of the best sub-DSLR camera out there but it doesn't come close to the DSLR . Not by a long shot. ANSWERNOTFOUND",it 's a decent camera,"(156, 176)"
B0002Y5WXO,accurate,How do you like the auto focus?,"My first every Ebay score, the Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens (featuring image stabilization) was a much coveted item around here.  It had come highly recommended and seemed to be a great complement to my beloved 50mm prime and a perfect replacement for the 18-55mm kit lens that shipped with the XTi.Initial, first-night impressions?  Heavenly.Compared to the other lenses that I've put on the business end of the XTi, the 17-85mm is one heavy dude.  I'd wager that it's at least as heavy as the camera and certainly feels as heavy as the 50mm and the 18-55mm put together.  The lens is serious.  It means business.  It traveled back in time from the future to be here with us today.  It's a touch of the photographic high-tech, made accessible to the amateur.With my right hand on the shutter and my left on the lens' barrel, it didn't feel any less heavy but ""heavy"", in my mind, became ""solid"".  The auto-focus is nice and quiet and is reasonably fast to lock onto the subject.  The focusing ring is also nice and big -- it cries out to be grasped and twisted.  It was a joy to realize that even with the auto-focus turned on, the lens would not complain if I fine-tuned a given shot with some manual adjustments.  (The AF doesn't totally commandeer the focus, that is to say.)  The zoom is also smooth, the barrel moving quickly and easily without over-shooting the desired focal length.Image stabilization is also a big plus.  I have a feeling that once I get the hang of it, it will save quite a few low-light, indoor, and hand-held shots over the lifetime of this lens.  This isn't to be nave and believe it to be a cure-all.  Certainly a few of my early test shots with the IS feature on prove that you can still wind up with a whole mess of blur.  But others worked out pretty well.After having used it for about two weeks or so now, most of these initial impressions have stayed true.  The IS feature is a good one but isn't something upon which to rely to save every shot.  You still need to have good light and the right angle, etc.; but with the right ISO setting, it can save the scene.  The heavy feeling of the lens is something I've gotten used to pretty quickly; after a couple of sessions, you just expect the camera to weight that much -- no worries.  I've also found that the longer focal lengths are great for portraiture -- I find myself using focal lengths in the 70-85mm range pretty often now and I wonder how I ever lived without them before.That said, I'm beginning to wonder a little about the lens' chromatic aberration.  I've had a few shots that don't seem to ""resolve"" the same way during post-processing (in Aperture) as similar shots under similar conditions with the same camera body and a different lens (e.g., the 50mm prime).  This is not to say that I have my mind made up and am squaring the blame on the lens -- certainly not!  But I am trying to parse my way through some of these, experimenting with some different conditions, etc. to see where it lands.  I've just fallen into a certain rhythm with my post-processing and I would hate to have to learn a new dance just for the one, new lens.All things considered however, I've been very pleased with most of my results from the 17-85mm thus far....so yeah, worth it.But with respect to ""worth it"":  Canon lists a retail price of $600 for the EF-S 17-85mm IS lens.  Most places online seem to offer it in the $475-$550 range.  As far as lenses go, this is hardly a costly one.  Considering that this is one of the two lenses ""given away"" as the kit lens for Canon's 40D body, you wonder a little bit if the mass-production maybe watered it down just a little bit...?  Just the same, this is a great ""walk-around"" lens:  it is sturdy, has some great built-in features, and has a versatile range of focal lengths.  If you got this lens ""free"" with your camera body then you are in luck.  If you're looking to pick up one separately...  Well, it's a great lens to have.  And I'm happy with mine.  But see if you can't score one on Ebay or through your local re-seller of high-quality, previously enjoyed lenses.Happy shooting, y'all. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the desired focal length,"(1360, 1384)"
B003HFCDLY,TRUE,How many real colors does the camera have?,"7 months and it has started popping up the auto adjust screen when it warms up. Auto adjust will  not close. the only way to make it go away temporarily is to turn the monitor off for a period of time, then after it has cooled down you can use the screen until it warms up again. Too bad because when the monitor works it has decent color and contrast.I purchased this monitor based on it's high reviews, but the life of this monitor is so short that the value is non existent.

B000EMWBT2,tiny,How is the design of the camera?,"I bought 2 of these around X-mas of last year for just over $200 each.  I really like the camera for the ease of use.  All the buttons and menu layout all are well designed and thought out enough, so that if you used a digital camera before, you don't have to read the manuel to figure out how to use all the functions.  I also like the fast start up time, the long battery life, and the various functions like video, continuous shooting mode etc...  None of these functions are unique to Cannon cameras though.  The color rendition is excellent.And this camera is pretty durable too.  I've carry one of these around often in my jean pocket.  The view screen did get scratched up a bit, but that's my fault for keeping coins and keys in the same pocket occasionally.What I didn't like about this camera is the quality of the pictures.  Even in good light you don't get really crisp and sharp pictures.  Perhaps I'm not being fair here.  The pictures from my Fuji2700 (only 2 mega pixels) look much crisper and sharper, but that camera is much bulkier with the bigger lens.  To be fair, I have not seen better pictures from any other super compact cameras in this class either.So, over all I would recommend this camera over any other comparable 6Mega pixel models in the same price range.  Just remember that it's great for taking snap shots and a bit more, but it's still a compact pocket camera with limitations. ANSWERNOTFOUND",all are well designed and thought out enough,"(151, 195)"
B003ELYQGG,impressive,How is the bass?,"These earbuds are nothing special. Their best attribute is that they are cheap. The sound from them is nothing special. In comparison to my standard white IPod buds these seem to emphasize the higher frequencies. There seems to be nothing happening in the bass range with these. I don't think they are efficient enough to have much bass at all. To be fair, my IPod buds overly emphasize bass so they are not that accurate either. I also compared these to a pricy Sennheiser set that I've owned for a couple of years and let's just say there is a reason why the Sennheisers cost more.Surely these Panasonic buds are very nice to use if you think they might get damaged somehow in use as it will not break your heart to have to replace them. These might be especially useful if you only listen to talk radio or have high frequency hearing loss. If you really like to listen to the most of your music and you must wear earbuds then these are not for you.I also have to note that these are packaged in a difficult to open blister pack that required several passes with utility shears to break into. I hate to see all the plastic that has to be discarded just to get this product out of the package.Cosmetically, they are OK. They don't hurt my ears and are comfortable to me. They come with a couple of other size ear pieces if you are hard to fit. The wires take a set when folded so they are not very well-behaved and don't coil nicely and lie flat when you put them away.

B003VAM32E,removable,How are battery?,"Lets keep this brief.  This is a comfortable, accurate gaming mouse with a relatively short battery lifespan.  That being said, I love this mouse.I have a skinny hands with long fingers.  This mouse fits me perfectly.  There's a slight learning curve for the thumb buttons.  However, I was hitting them perfectly within the first hour.  The contour of the index finger buttons makes them especially familiar immediately.  I have always preferred the contour of a Logitech mouse so none of this surprises me.In terms of tracking it works great, as it should.  I use a Razer Exactmat speed surface so I predicted and received flawless tracking.  Unfortunately I haven't tested this on any other surface so I can't comment.Others feel the battery life is poor.  It seems to last three hours while gaming.  I couldn't care less.  Leaving the cord plugged into a USB port and sitting on the desk is simple.  I've always had a corded mouse so it doesn't upset me to play while it charges.Weight has been a posted concern.  I tested the mouse at the local electronics shop first and liked it.  I tended to prefer maxing the weight on my old G5.Finally I couldn't help but comment on a faulty review posted below.  The scroll wheel toggles to allow both free spinning and locking via a simple button smack dab in the middle of the mouse.  Great for switching weapons or zipping through PDFs.All in all this may have been a frivolous purchase as my old G5 was running like a champ.  Still I'm very pleased. The features are fantastic.  Setpoint works like a champ for profiling.  With all the extra buttons this mouse easily bests the G5 for any RPG.Update:  6 months later and I still enjoy the form and function of this mouse.

I've always pressed spacebars as they were meant to be pressed so I had no issues adjusting.The largest challenge with this keyboard is using home row correctly, Microsoft puts out products based on the standard, and has done this with its' Natural line since the start. I use my left hand correctly, my right, on my Logitech Elite, went all over the place; I can only imagine how wrong my right hand usage was. This keyboard forces you to relearn typing, for typing classes, a Natural keyboard would be perfect, it makes you type correctly. I don't much like the N key, but I've learned to use it and the M key correctly, no more hitting my enter key while going for quotes either.The zoom function is novelty, not necessity, it's fun to use normally but mostly useless otherwise, really exclusively for the always-in-office user, what they need to do is make it a scroll button too, it's highly sensitive and easy to use, which would make scrolling silky smooth in a way only overpriced mice manage.Therein lies the problem, the software is inferior to my cheapie Logitech Elite(Which had more functions I might add as well as better software.), there is hardly any customization to be had. There is no taskbar icon; most of the remapping done is through an interface integrated into the already well-hidden Keyboard area under the control panel. Remapping options are less than fantastic, the favorites keys are useless, the back and forward buttons will work with either a browser or a media player, not both, zoom cannot be reconfigured, and Mail only allows one indicated program to be opened.This is what is wrong with the favorite's keys, they allow but five programs to be opened, you cannot indicate that you wish to open a menu of programs to select, merely one program per key, same with all of the other keys. The lack of ""My"" keys for the F# Buttons is annoying, but that's just a design decision for a non-media keyboard, and I don't mind much.This keyboard would've done better to have more configuration and just a couple more media keys, but I suppose it's my fault for asking that much of it, it's designed for the office, not a music listeners hands. I'll go into the aesthetics of this baby now to round it off.Some may notice the shift keys are smaller, and the enter key even smaller, the right of the keyboard is larger than the left in the way of keys, which seems fine, to me at least, I find reaching the Backspace key uncomfortable, placing your hands on this keyboard is like a match made in heaven, seems a shame to reach so far away and break off from paradise.That leads me to this palm rest, wow, sick of those cheap detachable plastic palm rests(Read: Wrist Destroyers)? This is your ticket, so soft, yet strong, it's the cashmere of palm wrests. The 2x3 layout is back to normal, which I very much enjoy, insert is back home and delete is too. The keys above the numpad offer more functions that I have yet to use, but are nice to have all the same, the curvature of the keys takes getting used to, particularly the aforementioned N key and it's sibling the M key. The Alt, Ctrl, Windows, Menu, and Start keys are all gigantic and hard to miss, they feel pretty great.The spacebar, apparently if struck correctly, is amazing, it's designed for this keyboard in a way that no spacebar has ever been, it's almost destructive of what you're typing looking down while you type, seeing it all functioning the way it does, it's almost like some kind of alien technology, which is why I don't look.The...crappy plastic attachment that comes attached(Oddly enough) to this masterpiece is best taken out(Easily) and forgotten, it's all personal preference of course, I didn't like it, the slope of the keys makes leaving your hands where they are painless and then very comfortable. The prop-ups on the back make it more conventional and I rather like them, but now the size.This keyboard is undeniably the largest keyboard I have ever laid eyes on, the sheer width and height is enough to make a laptop user gawk for moments at a time, it is critical you have a large amount of desk space to place this on, I didn't, and I had to move my entire PC over more to the left just to manage a nice cozy fit. When the legs on this baby are propped it also reaches monitor height, I.E., it will not fit very well under a monitor, which is why it is best used in a keyboard tray, though I'd worry about it's large scale hurting the tray after a long enough time.In conclusion, this is a masterful piece of hardware, and it has virtually no flaws, the software is pathetic at best and obviously designed for the dullard worker drone, it's a pity really, all the same, it deserves four stars, here's to hoping they manage to improve the boring, bland software.8/10 (Not an average) ANSWERNOTFOUND",This keyboard forces you to relearn typing,"(678, 720)"
B001KC08A4,large,What's the button?,"It does the job, and I especially like the back light.  I was able to set this up to control my TV, cable box, roku, and even a PC attached to my machine (with a wireless usb pc remote control mouse purchased separately).  My complaint though, is that a couple of buttons are already not functioning, after only a few months.  One of those is one of the device buttons, for the DVD device, where I had programmed the Roku.  So I moved that to the Aud decive button, and now I have a 6 component remote.  More annoying was the up channel button now isn't working.  OK, so I reprogrammed the fav button just above that to act as a channel up.  Hard to give more than 3 stars though, given these issues, though the design and features are nice.  It also was some trouble to program for the Roku; it would be much better if there were a preset for this.  Since I have the Roku 2 XS, which ships with a bluetooth remote, I had to purchase the basic remote from Roku just to have something to program this with.Aside from that, no real complaints.  Some of the buttons are a little tough to read in lower light, basically black buttons with greyish text.  But the back light button takes care of that, lighting up that text in bright red.  So no need to have any doubt what you are looking at. ANSWERNOTFOUND",But the back light button takes care of that,"(1150, 1194)"

B00DIOALPE,similar,How was the sound?,"I just ordered a white pair from Amazon. Got them this past SaturdayI was really worried about the sound quality. I wanted them to listen to music and they do just that and sound pretty decent. There was one issue though.I charged them up and set them up to my ipad. While listening to music that was actually stored on the ipad the sound would just randomly cut out. I then connected it to my note 3 and played music from Pandora. It did the same thing and it was extremely random but frequent. I just sent an email Planttronics regarding this issue and to find out if this normal operation. I also googled the issue as well, it doesn't seem to be common but has happened with other headsets of theirs.I will report back after I hear from them.***EDIT***I got my replacement 2 days later. Charged both the headphones and the case. Paired with the ipad and my note 3 and boom, no more intermittent drops on sound. Crystal clear audio. Went to charge them with the case and now i have a different problem. The light on the headphones goes red for 2 seconds showing charging and then cuts out, while the light on the case that indicates the case is charged blinks and never charges the headphones. But the headphones charge when directly connected to the charger. Called Plantronics and they stated it was a defective case and are sending out a replacement case....4/24/14 update2nd update, I got the replacement case and still have the same issue. I got a replacement headphone order shipped to me from amazon and the sound is completely different in the new head set. The sound has way too much highs now and there is no bass. So I have another crappy set. With this much variation in product performance there is no quality control with on this headset and I will be calling Plantronics back as well as amazon to get this resolved.Maybe this is a rare occurrence and just my bad luck.

B004KKZ0HO,poor,How is the image quality like?,"The title speaks for itself:  This proves to me that Panasonic has not done any really relevant and ground-breaking research in developing this camera (and others in the same category) because their imaging sensor is horrendeous.  The photos are full of colourful specks of noise and are very smudgy and blurry, even at ISOs as low as 400!  At 800, 1600 they are a disaster!  The exposure of videos is poor and overall, low light performance is also very poor.  I took a photo of my livingroom under tungster/halogen lighting which came out OK but again with much noise.  Then I made a video of the same room right afterwards under the same lighting conditions and the video was too dark.  This camera also has no exposure compensation for videos.  I read the manual and it clearly indicates that videos are strictly in automatic mode with no exposure control at all by the photographer.  You are at the mercy of the camera.  The Canon PowerShot SX220/230 HS DOES have exposure compensation for videos FYI...The only good thing is that the videos are smooth because of a fast 60fps (interlaced i - not progressive p though).  And having a GPS is just a gimmick and a toy to fool consumers, and does not make the picture quality of this camera any more ""attractive"" or in any way better.Having a Leica lens is not enough because a good digital camera also needs a good image sensor.  The actual sharpness and noise level in the image is determined largely by the sensor.  One can have the best lens in the world and have a poor sensor and the resulting photos and videos will be horrible.  This camera is not worth it!  For the same price ($449) wait for the Sony Cybershot HX100V - it is outstanding based on reviews on the internet.

B002LITT42,stunning,How is the image?,"If you read the 5-star reviews of this camera, I can tell you that they are all true. This camera is probably the best P&S; Canon ever made and then some. I have a long history using Canon P&S; and this one is the best ever. I wansn't totally happy with other Canon P&S;, having tried most of them. The control ring around the lens make this camera a step above all of its competitors. Depend on the mode you are in (Av, Tv..), the ring functions differently. For example, if you are in aperture priority (Av), turn the ring will change the f-stops. So in Tv, the ring will change your shutter speed. And then you can reprogram it to change something else if you wish. Image quality is superb. No noise or any bluring even at actual-pixel level. Astoundingly sharp with sufficient light and way above average low light performance. And just imaging you can put all this in your pocket!Now, Amazon customer service. I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago *on Amazon* for $429. Today it is $406 *on Amazon*. If I want my $23 credit, I have to return the camera and order a new one. Amazon's new policy does not allow credit in this situation. Just imaging buying a large item and price drops the next day for several hundred dollars.

B002QUZM0U,hard to press,How is the button?,"This is my favorite laptop mouse of all times! I have tried several other mice in the past, including Microsoft Explorer Mini Mouse, which is great too, but I've never liked the 'smooth' mouse wheel. This Logitech mouse allows you to choose between both, which is a plus! Battery life is great too; it's been over a year now and I'm still using the same batteries. The quality/feel of the mouse is very durable and feels great in my hands. Although smaller than I would like, this is a 'laptop' mouse and I have no complaints on that.Usability, I'm writing this review using my mouse on my bed as the surface and it works great!The usb transmitter is small enough to leave it plugged into my laptop at all times. On the mouse, a coool feature of turning it off and protecting the lens from dust is very convenient too!This mouse is quite expensive, I agree to that, but if you can, wait for rebates. They have it every now and then, even after a year I still see rebates out @ Amazon.Also, one more thing about this mouse is that I live in a pretty high humidity location (Hawaii) and it affects some of my desktop Logitech mice's texture. (eg. MX1000) For some reason on the sides, the thin layer material tends to swell up and deteoriate over time. This mouse doesn't have that problem.Not much else to say that other reviewers haven't said, but I'm getting one more as a gift! Highly recommended!

B006ZBWV0K,sturdy,How resistant is the cover?,"I got this for my wife and she loves it.  Strangely, their product description doesn't do this item justice.First, they should (in the actual Product description) state it fits the Kindle Paperwhite.Then, they don't mention the elastic closure, similar to MoleSkin notebooks, to keep it from accidentally opening.  I debated between this one and another with a magnetic clasp closure.  I'm glad I chose this one because the magnetic clasp and closure would be very bulky and magnetics and electronics generally don't mix.She likes the look, the feel, the holding of it, the fact the covers flips back easily and a slim inside pocket for holding things (emergency cash, a business card, etc) and finally the elastic closure that wraps around the cover to keep it closed.The Kindle PaperWhite stays slim and fits into her purse and keeps it protected.Happy wife, happy life, so 5 stars from me! ;-) ANSWERNOTFOUND","they do mention the closure ,","(205, 244)"
B008DWH00K,awesome,How is the color?,"I'm very happy with my new display. The colors all looked great out of the box, there were no dead or bright pixels, and the unit as a whole is very solid. I've ordered my fair share of displays through Amazon over the years and have always done so confidently as their return policy and procedure is fantastic. I am glad to say I have no reason to return this display.Again, the display is very sturdy and solid. The elevation mechanism is true and the rotation works perfectly, though I will probably be mounting it sooner or later on one of my Ergotrons. Lastly, I love the bezel. I prefer a nice thin bezel and this one looks great. Perfect for a multi-monitor set-up.FTR, I am using it with a late 2012 Mac Mini in a Dual Display configuration.EDIT: Two more things:1) As far as light bleed is concerned, when the black screensaver comes on I do see bleed on the corners as is common with this kind of monitor. During use, however, I have yet to notice anything at all. It only seems to be an issue when the screen is dark which it never is in my workflow. YMMV.2) I have a hard time using some LED-lit monitors including a Viewsonic that my wife recently got. The text is constantly shifting around and the whole thing bothers my eyes.

B000I1ZWRC,good,How is the quality of the return policy?,"Ok so I have now been using the rebel xti for a few months, and shot hundreds and hundreds perhaps thousands of pictures. Yes it is a good camera, and yes it will satisfy most first time SLR users needs. BUT BE WARNED, if you are planing to get serious there are better choices out there! I originally stated that I was able to shoot a number of sports (soccer, hockey, rugby) with no trouble, and I still stand by that. However even a couple hundred more dollars will get you the 30D and in my opinion its a way better deal. Its not quite as easy to use button and menu wise, but thats something you can get used to! The AF is way faster and quieter, the increase in fps is a HUGE advantage for sports, the body feels great (maybe not for small hands) and is heavier which provides balance when hand holding L series telephoto such as the 70-200 f/4L. I just recently used the 30D with the 70-200 f/4L for a collegiate soccer game and let me tell you the difference was amazing. Compared to the xti and 70-200 the AF was way way faster. It made all the difference, and  a lot more of my shots came out useable. If you have the extra money I would highly recommend the 30D over the xti. Ultimately go hold them both, but the 30D just feels better and more solid. If your shooting an elementary school game the xti is great, but if your planning on doing anything semi serious the extra couple hundred is worth it. I give this camera four stars because I wont deny that it is a a good camera, however I leave out the fifth star because it lacks that extra kick of the 30D and obviously more expensive cameras. Plus the shutter on the 30D sounds way better. lol. ANSWERNOTFOUND",now,"(13, 16)"

B00DVFLJDS,same,How about the specs?,"**REVIEW UPDATED ON 7/30/13 - Updated speakers, ""other features"", battery life, gripes**For anyone on the fence, and especially for those frustrated by the performance slowdown issues with the original Nexus 7 tablet, don't let that scare you off from buying the second generation model.Google made all of the right improvements to the product, and the result is a significantly improved product for a marginally higher cost. Only time will tell if this unit suffers the same performance fate as the original model (for those not familiar, over time, the first generation tablets tended to quickly slow down and struggle to perform even basic tasks like browsing the internet). However, Android 4.3 feels ultra-smooth so far, and I am hoping that Google and Asus learned from their original mistakes.SCREEN: The new screen is absolutely stunning. Some people argue that the resolution of 323 pixels per inch is unnecessary, but you can really see the difference when you use it in person. Text is significantly sharper and a little easier on the eye to read. Using the tablet to watch videos and see pictures produces a stunning result.PROCESSOR: This is the #1 reason I'd recommend this new, upgraded Nexus 7 over the older version. The speed upgrade is unquestionably immense, and to those who have used the older and newest model Nexus 7, you will notice and appreciate this immediately. Apps load instantly; the internet browsing experience is smooth and a very welcome upgrade over past performance. It's strange; a few days ago I was satisfied with the decent albeit declining performance of my 1st Gen Nexus 7. Now that I have this new one, I use them both side by side and the older model feels like a dinosaur. This alone is reason enough to upgrade.SIZE/WEIGHT: The reduced thickness and weight of the tablet is very noticeable. I often times used my old Nexus 7 tablet while sitting in bed, to check email and browse the web prior to going to sleep. Holding the old Nexus in one hand, and the new one in the other, the differences in size and weight are VERY noticeable. No doubt will provide a more comfortable long term usage experience, especially for extended sessions while on flights or the subway.BATTERY LIFE: After a couple days of using this new Nexus 7, I can confidently say that the battery life has been significantly improved over the original model. My previous session of about 2 hours straight of use (screen on, using apps that draw semi-frequent data over wi-fi) drained only 20% of the battery life. If I project this out, it would tell me that I could get 10 hours of constant use on one full charge. I haven't run through an entire charge yet from 100% down to 0% (I've been recharging after each use), but I'll try to get to that sometime this week and report back on my total real-world battery life.CAMERAS: Google added a rear-facing Camera on this new second gen Nexus. While I typically wouldn't use my tablet as a camera, I have tried it out and it takes excellent pictures. Focuses quickly, the images are sharp and the low light performance, while not great, is better than I would have expected. The front-facing camera gets more use for me (I use my tablets to Skype with family). The new front facing camera is noticeably sharper and better in lower light situations than the original Nexus 7 camera was. In low light, the old model was almost unusable. The 2nd gen Nexus 7 low light performance is very acceptable.SPEAKERS: I've now spent some time using this second-gen Nexus 7 side by side with my original Nexus 7. Separately, they both sound very acceptable for speakers from small tablets. Using them side by side, the improvements to the Nexus 7 are very noticeable, and the sound is more clear even at high volumes. I'd say that this new model sounds far less ""tinny"" than the original Nexus did. Personally, I don't use the built-in speakers often (I'm normally either listening with headphones, or using bluetooth audio to my Logitech Boombox). But for people who do use the built-in speakers to play music or watch movies, you will appreciate the improvement in the speakers.OTHER FEATURES: Last night, I realized that this tablet is compatible with Qi Wireless Charging, a discovery which made me VERY happy. I use a Nexus 4 cell phone, and I keep it on my nightstand on the Google Nexus Charging Orb. I attempted to use the orb with this new Nexus 7 tablet, and it worked perfectly. You have to sit the tablet landscape, with the orb centered on the tablet, and it synced up and began charging instantly.COMPARISONS: I will update this section shortly with my comparison review between this 2nd Gen Nexus 7, the iPad Mini, and the Kindle Fire HD, as soon as I've had more time to test them all side by side.GRIPES AND COMPLAINTS: Here, I'll list any gripes that I have about the tablet. My first major gripe is that I am not a huge fan of the texture/material used on the back of the tablet. It's a slightly rubberized feeling coating, which I assume they did to create additional grip. However, I've been finding that after holding with one hand for a few minutes, I notice the tablet starting to slide a little bit in my hand. I think this is a combination of the new texture plus the fact that it's thinner than it used to be. I'm probably going to be purchasing a case for it shortly, which should alleviate this problem, but it is still worth noting. This is just a personal preference things (if you normally hold it landscape w/ two hands, you'll probably prefer this new texture over the old one).All in all, I am VERY impressed with how much faster this tablet is than my original Nexus 7 tablet. As long as this model doesn't suffer the performance slowdown issue of the original Nexus 7, I don't anticipate moving this away from a 5 star product anytime soon, but only time will tell I guess. I will keep this review updated as I go, and add thoughts on more features once I test them out further (the speakers, longer term battery life tests, performance slowdown, etc). If you have anything else you want me to address, please let me know in the comments section and I will be glad to address it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",and especially,"(113, 127)"

B001F51G16,sleek,How is the design?,"Just wanted to write this review to warn those looking to use this keyboard for gaming.  Purchased this keyboard at a major retail store yesterday and immediately returned it.  This is an excellent keyboard, the design is elegant, the keys feel very nice,the backlighting is nice and its truly whisper-quiet.  However, this keyboard has one MAJOR flaw that makes it not usable for gaming.  The keyboard has a feature that is supposed to help with typing mistakes, and it basically only allows for 2 simultaneous key presses at once for most keys...if there is a 3rd key pressed it does not take that input.This is a show stopper for gaming because one critical combination does not work: you can't press the Spacebar key while pressing a letter key and shift.  So basically in FPS games, you cannot jump while sprinting.  In practice this feels completely debilitating.  I immediately noticed the flaw in BF3, and tried it with other games (including Skryim) and can confirm that its an issue.  I checked reviews on Newegg and many reviewers mentioned the same flaw.So if you're looking to use this keyboard for anything other than gaming, I would highly recommend it.  However it just can't be used for gaming as you can't press mutliple keys at once.  Sad considering everything else about this keyboard is fantastic.

B0074BW614,nice,How would you describe the build of the camera?,"I was an early adopter of the original Kindle Fire in November 2011. I loved the Fire, but it was a bit clunky in some tasks, and it sadly lacked some desirable hardware features. I'm happy to say that I've had my Kindle Fire HD for a few hours, and my initial impressions are very positive. Clearly, Amazon listened to customers and addressed many of their comments. For starters:1. There's an external volume control. This was my single biggest gripe with the original Fire.2. There's a built-in microphone. That means you can Skype and use cool apps like Soundhound and Shazam. With the front-facing camera, you can do video Skyping, which is a big plus. The lack of a microphone or mic input was my second biggest gripe with the original Fire.3. An HDMI port means you can connect your Fire HD directly to most TV sets. I have a Roku, so that's not as big of a deal to me, but the HDMI puts the Fire HD out in front of almost every other tablet. I definitely want to try streaming Amazon instant video to a hotel TV the next time I travel.4. The video is noticeably crisper for videos.5. Bluetooth is a great new feature. It opens the possibility of wirelessly connecting the Fire HD to a myriad of products. I've been using a small, portable Bluetooth speaker to amplify my original Fire's sound. That works, but only with a cable connecting the Fire and the speaker. With the Fire HD, it only took a minute to activate the Bluetooth, find the speaker, and pair it with the Fire HD.6. The sound quality is very noticeably better. So far I haven't encountered an MP3 or video where I had to strain to hear, and oftentimes I'm having to back down on the volume.7. The web browser appears to be a little faster, although I won't really know how much faster until I upgrade my wireless router to a newer, dual band model. The wi-fi reception is quite good. When I connected the HD to our home network, the HD detected ten other networks in near-by houses, which is more than our laptop PC can detect.8. In the original Fire, using the graphic handles to select text was awkward and not always very responsive, especially with text in emails. The HD appears to have improved considerably the ease of selecting text.9. Unlike the original Fire, the memory is not partitioned, so it appears you can use all the user-available memory (12.63 GB) for anything - books, video, music, photos, etc. This is a big improvement.10. The virtual keyboard has been restored to something closer to the original Fire. Once again, there are separate periods and commas, so you don't have to hold down the period to type a comma. This was a real improvement.11. Text-to-Speech for books has returned to the HD. There aren't any settings - the voice is either on or off, and there's only a female voice - but it sounds more like a human voice and less like a computer than before.The HD was delivered already registered to me, so about all I had to do was connect with my wi-fi, set up my Gmail account (less than one minute) and set my favorites for the web browser, then download some of my books, magazines, videos, and apps from the Cloud. With 8GB of memory in the original Fire, I often had to delete apps before downloading any new apps. With 16GB in the Fire HD, that's much less critical.Because the size is different and the controls and ports have been moved around, cases for the original Kindle Fire won't work. The padded envelope sleeve that I had for the original Kindle Fire does work, although it's not a perfect fit.One annoyance: the Kindle Fire HD displays color advertisements on its lock screen, so every time you turn on the HD, you see advertisements for a Kindle e-book, a video, Amazon MP3 music, and such. Amazon has announced that owners can opt-out of the ads for $15. After using the HD for a few days, if the ads are too annoying, I may opt-out. Update: Apparently only the rotating lock screen ads can be removed by opting out. The targeted ""suggestions"" that show up when you're in the Amazon Store won't go away, so I don't know if it's worth $15 to opt-out. You'll have to decide that. You can do this at any time from your ""Manage My Kindle"" page.Invariably, the Kindle Fire HD is going to be compared to the Nexus 7, its closest competition in size, performance, and price. The HD weighs 13.9 oz. vs. 12 oz. for the Nexus (the original Fire weighed 14.6 oz.). That weight difference is at least partially offset by longer claimed battery life: 11 hours for the HD vs. 8 hours for the Nexus. Screen resolution is 1280x800 for both tablets (the original Fire's resolution was 1024x600). Most of the new features of the HD, like the front-facing camera and the microphone, are common to both tablets, but the HDMI port on the HD is a very nice feature that the Nexus can't match. I've used a Nexus 7, and it's a wonderful tablet, but based on my initial impressions, my slight favorite is the Kindle Fire HD, mainly for its ability to stream Amazon instant videos (which the Nexus can't, at least not without some finagling).Overall, the HD appears to be a worthy successor to the original Kindle Fire.-------------------------------------------Update (September 15, 2012):* At first, the layout of the various screens is somewhat different from the original Fire, but after playing around for a while, I'm getting used to it, and learning how everything works is pretty intuitive.* I'm reading on forums that some folks are having problems running some of the apps they had on the original Kindle Fire. For example, I'm having problems with MapQuest - it starts up, but crashes within a minute or so. It's probably just some glitches that will be fixed with the first OS upgrade.* The power button and volume control switch are flush with the case. It's not a big deal, but I wish they stuck out a millimeter or so to make it easier to feel them.* The original Fire was noticeably rectangular, so I used it mostly in the portrait position. The HD is more square, and it seems more natural to use it in the landscape position. ANSWERNOTFOUND",adopter,"(15, 22)"

B003VANO7C,full,How is the keyboard?,"The Keyboard:The keys are  very soft and smooth, they do not make a huge clicking sound when you type. At first I thought the smaller flatter keys would make my typing a lot less accurate because its harder to feel out individual keys but I actually type a lot better on this keyboard! The F and J keys have raised bumps on them to help you find where you need to put your pointer fingers.  I love the full-sized backspace key (my old keyboard had a tiny one) but I wish it also had a raised bump on it to find it easier. The capslock key has a tiny green light to indicate it is active but the scroll and numlock keys do not have indicators.On the top of the keyboard are media keys - to adjust the volume on the right side, and play/forward/backward on the left side. The F keys double as hotkeys via the FN key next to the right-side alt. There are keys to open your browser, media player, and even restart your pc! On the right side there are even more useful keys! keys for going forward and backward in your browser, opening your bookmarks menu, and opening the calculator. the calculator key is really handy for me as I do my math homework online, and i love that it is right above the number pad!The keyboard is pretty big and has a ledge on the bottom to rest your wrists on I guess. My keyboard tray is a bit small so I would prefer if the keyboard did not have this ledge! I keep my keyboard at an angle and it is just inconvenient. This is really my only complaint about the keyboard! Everything else is great.OH! one last thing to mention about the keyboard is that the keys are nestled tightly on the board so its a lot harder to get crumbs stuck in there! That's a definite plus for me because I have major night eating habits..The Mouse:the mouse is not tiny but also not huge. It is very basic, two buttons and a scroll wheel. It fits very comfortably in my small hands. I've used it both right handed and left handed and its very ergonomic! It only runs well if you have it on a mousepad, which is my only complaint because with other mouses I've used they have worked fine without a mousepad on my keyboard tray. But on the mousepad it runs very smoothly and comfortably.Overall I think this is a great combo! I bought it at Fry's and there was a rebate, so I think I paid $30? for it. I normally do not buy expensive keyboards because I tend to break them a lot..But this combo is definitely worth it. Its of great quality and very sturdy. I drop both components all the time and have not ever even experienced lag!I just want to edit this review to say that the keyboard has lasted 1000000000000000 times longer than any other keyboard I've owned. It is covered in nail polish and many parts are melted from spilling acetone on it. The paint on many keys has rubbed off from greasy and acetone covered fingers. The media button for going to the previous song got something sticky trapped around it so it is pretty much unusable. I have thrown this keyboard on the floor and across the room probably a thousand times. It falls off my keyboard tray onto my chair or the floor just about every time i get up. It sometimes does become unresponsive for as much as a minute at a time, which is unbearable. I hit it furiously when that happens. Crumbs HAVE managed to find their way through the cracks between the keys but its cool. I really think this keyboard is great for what I put it through.The mouse is in...gently used...condition. It works fine. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The keys are   very soft and smooth,"(13, 47)"

The side are open but the catch the hold the device in seem to be strategically positioned so as to protect the device in critical areas if dropped.

B002RL875A,sensitive,Which button we have to push to start the device?,"I replaced a Harmony 720 with the Harmony One. Since the 720 was not going to be used any longer, I used the replace remote button in the software. It transferred the account over to the Harmony One and loaded all the settings, Almost. It did not transfer any of the additional buttons I had defined for the previous remote or the ""favorite channels"" settings. This meant a fair amount of reprogramming.Other than that, I really like the new remote. It does everything well, the buttons feel good, and I like most of the layout. The touch screen, while very responsive, cannot be used by touch, like the older 720 screen could. On the 720 there were 3 buttons on each side of the screen, and this was much easier to do by touch.The range of the IR signal seems to be very good, and I don't have to point it directly at the Home theater setup, like I had to do with the 720.Overall I think the Harmony One is a great remote.

B00ET9YYS2,responsive,How is the keyboard?,"This is a great keyboard.  I also own the original Airbender that I used with my iPad 2.  It was very good and I've been very happy with it, but I have to admit, this is a nice improvement.The overall look is much improved.  It is very clean and professional looking.  It is also somewhat ruggedized though I haven't tested the overall durability.  It is much lighter than the original keyboard and some of the competing keyboards that I checked out.  The weight is heavier than you might expect if you haven't used a keyboard before, but it is a nice complement to the iPad Air.  The overall design makes it very stable when using it on your lap.  The case is designed to allow you to rotate the iPad from landscape to portrait.  This is very convenient and also allows you to choose which direction you like the iPad's buttons to be on.The keyboard itself is surprisingly easy to type on. They keys are normal size and have normal spacing.  I can type on this keyboard as easily as I can my desktop keyboard.  The keys have good feedback.  There are also dedicated iOS keys for home and lock.  Additionally there are the extra keys necessary to work with OSX and Windows.The keyboard connects via Bluetooth.  It is very simple to pair it with the iPad.  While designed for iPad, it also works with iPhones and computers.The keyboard charges via micro-usb.  It does not take long to charge and the battery lasts a very long time.The new Airbender 2.0 also has a nice new design that allows the iPad stand to be removed from the keyboard and stand alone.  This allows you to set it up similar to a separate keyboard and monitor like you would have with your computer.  This feature actually works very well on a solid surface.Overall, I'm pretty impressed with the improvements in this keyboard.  The design is nice, the keyboard is very easy to type on, and it is very easy to use. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This is a great keyboard,"(0, 24)"

B0044YU60M,easy to set,How did you like the router?,"I am a professional writer, focusing on computer-related products, so I don't give 5 star reviews so easily. This product however definitely deserves it.The router took about 10' to install and has worked like a charm since then. Positioned in the ground floor of the house, it manages to give a strong enough signal to be received at 135 Mbps from the upper floor. And that's from my net-book, which has a quite mediocre network card. My room-mate claims that he has a super high speed, both for downloading and for uploading, from his desktop computer.The router has a fairly easy menu, though it took us a good 7 minutes to configure all the security settings (you can never be too careful these days). Other routers may be better in this aspect. However, this is something you only do once (or twice at most) so it's not a big deal.The bottom line is that this product is not just a good buy, but something you can cherish for a while. I would highly recommend it to any computer user who relies a lot on a wireless network for his/her internet access.One thing that it is a bit bizarre though is that the upload speed is about 3 times higher than the download speed, something that has been observed it two computers in our network. Usually DL speed is significantly lower than UL speed. That's not an issue though, since the important factor is the connection stability, which has exceeded our expectations.

The skullcandy ones sounded really harsh and weren't very clear, but they had awesome bass because they sort of made a seal with your ear. These ones have less bass, yet deeper and more precise bass. They don't really make that seal with your ear, but it's kind of nice because they don't hurt your ear drums if you take them out fast. The skullcandy headphones were just kind of like TONS of OK bass, but these you can play deep rap or electronic music on and hear all those low notes along with the 10-16k high pitched stuff as well, without all the 3-4k harsh stuff (for the more technichal people out there).

B0081H8TRA,fine,Dose this performance fine?,"UPDATE 2/12/2014I will no longer recommend this router. Only two firmware updates since the release and main issues are not addressed. I've upgraded to R7000 which has a lot more support.UPDATE 12/26/2013Recently purchased a few latest AC routers specifically Asus RT-AC68U, Linksys EA6900, Dlink DIR-868L, Netgear R7000 and ended up going back to R6300V2. None offered more range or performance of R6300V2 despite having external antennas. While most of these new high end routers had some additional features, some of them had really unstable firmware, especially RT-AC68U & EA6900.  Netgear R7000 is probably the best of the bunch and I would've kept it if I didn't have R6300V2 already. It doesn't really bring more range or performance either and it barely has any new features especially for average user, but at least Netgear has more interest in keeping it up to date with frequent firmware updates.UPDATE 7/30/2013Bought R6300v2 to see if there is any difference. V2 now comes with dual core processor 800Mhz, 256MB of RAM and USB 3.0, it is also twice as small and comes with smaller power supply. All nice upgrades, but did it translate into better performance? In short, yes. For regular users, they may not notice the difference, but if you have gazillion of gadgets that use WiFi especially HD streaming you will be pleased that it offers better performance. I don't have any hard numbers to back this up, but overall this upgrade is totally worth it for my busy wifi network.UPDATE 6/27/2013My R6300 is now over a year old and it actually performs better then it did when it was initially released thanks to several firmware updates. I've tried latest AC offerings from Dlink & Asus and they just didn't offer as good range and reliability as R6300. Netgear might release a replacement soon, but for now this is still the best overall AC router despite what reviews say on smallnetbuilder website.UPDATE 1/9/2013I've been using this router for over half a year now and it hasn't skipped the beat. Performance has been top notch and it can handle 15 wireless clients with a few HD IP Cameras. It's been running uninterrupted for the past 3 month. Sure there are other new AC routers that came out since then, which I haven't tested, but this has been a wonderful router so far and I am not looking for another replacement at the moment. Not surprising that the price is exactly what I paid 6 month ago, which means the router is actually holds its value for being one of the best out there.INTROMy past 3 year history of routers include Netgear WDR3700, Cisco E4200 and most recently two Asus RT-N56u using wireless bridge, but I was never impressed with the speed of wireless and 5Ghz band coverage. This was about time for my next upgrade, so I bought 3 routers RT-N66U, Amped Wireless R20000G & Netgear R6300 and I kept the latter and here is why:THE GOOD:- Range/Speed/Performance in 5 Ghz band: Excellent! While not a huge leap forward it does perform much better than any of the previous and competing routers I've tried using this band. This was a major selling point for me. It is actually able to provide excellent download speeds in the opposite corner of the 1500 sq/feet townhome that none of the other routers could handle. Also with Mac Mini 2010 Broadcom wifi, I was able to achieve up to 22 MB/sec download speed from NAS at about 15 feet with latest firmware. Previously with RT-N56 it topped at 10 MB/sec at the same location. That's double the speed! I can't wait to try this out with AC clients!- Range/Speed/Performance in 2.4 Ghz band: The range is excellent. It covers my entire home, but so did my previous router, so it's difficult to judge the improvement here.  However, there is noticeable performance boost. Among several wireless devices using this band I have 4 HD (1080p - 720p) IP cameras and previous Asus router had trouble with handling all of them with good frame rate where with R6300 I am finally able to stream all of them at once. Also, your performance will depend on the client. Previously I was using 2010 HP Envy 14 w/ Intel 6200 which was showing download speed at 4-6 MB/sec, 2012 HP Envy 17 w/ Intel 6300 showing much better results at 6-8 MB/Sec at the same location. While Mac Mini 2010 w/ Broadcom WiFi shows speeds less then 1MB sec. Basically, older clients may have some performance issues.- Setup:  It wasn't complicated all and looks fairly straight forward for non-technical people as well.- Plenty of features for basic and advanced users: Guest network, Wireless bridge etc... all thereI CAN DEAL WITH IT:- Size: This router is about twice the size of any of the previous routers I've owned- Guest Network: Yes, it's available, but it's very basic. I've seen Asus RT-N66U guest network control which lets you specify the time limit or expiration.- Administration panel locks after about a minute of inactivity and you are prompted to enter your username & password again (very annoying when you trying to troubleshoot things!)- Parental features. I don't like the fact that you need to install tool on your pc, there is no web administration on management in the web ui.OTHER THINGS:- First router that I see without WEP setting.- Some of the older clients (specifically HP Envy 14 w/ Intel 6200 card) had connection issues with sleep/restart. I've upgraded my laptop since then and have not had this issue anymore- Mine appears to be defective where the activity lights at the bottom are not lighting up, except Netgear logo. (UPDATE 7/10 I've gotten a new one without this issue)PREVIOUS UPDATES:UPDATE 10/13: This is probably going to be my last update since I really don't have anything else to add other then this has been a wonderful router ever since I upgraded to 1.0.2.36_1.0.28 version. I've been running without reboots for a month now and no problems with performance whatsoever.UPDATE 9/6: 3 month later and still loving this router. If you live in a large home and have wireless coverage issues with 5 Ghz band you should definitely give this one a try. Overall it's been rock stable for me with only one nagging issue related to 5Ghz band (see my previous update). Netgear support got a hold of me and I've been helping them to troubleshoot the issue by sending router logs. They provided a beta update for me that fixed the issue which they will be releasing in September.UPDATE 7/10: Month later the router still performs very well. I am hoping for new firmware soon to improves performance and compatibility with older devices. Still have issues with Envy 14, Mac Mini 2010 and also HTC Sensation phone. They all exhibit different issues. First one takes a long time to connect, second one has very low speed on 2 Ghz band and last one occasionally unable to connect. There was also one hiccup. I was running uninterrupted for 2 weeks straight using latest firmware and 5Gh signal degraded from Excellent to Poor and 4 to 2 bars at the same location. I've rebooted the router and everything went back to normal.UPDATE 6/13: 2 weeks now with the router. Sold my two Asus N56U that I used as a wireless bridge and that were once highly rated at SNB. I honestly do not know why SNB posted terrible results with R6300, they must have defective unit but that's still not the case for me. I am perfectly satisfied with R6300 and it delivers excellent performance/range throughout the house without the need of any bridges or extenders which I once had to use. I do have defective unit where I don't get any activity lights, so I might exchange it at some point. Did I mention, this is an awesome router?UPDATE 6/7: Netgear released new firmware which enables Guest network that caused so much noise and negative reviews in the initial release, the were no other fixes listed, but upon my own checking I noticed they added ""Performance boost"" option in the Advanced > Wireless settings. I performed my usual download test which showed a slight increase in download speed on 5Ghz band, but it's hard to say if it was related to the firmware or not.UPDATE 6/4: SmallNetBuilder released preliminary test results that compare performance R6300 with a few other N routers that show that it doesn't perform as good as expected in some cases. Also mentioned my results in the process when compared to N56U. I only had R6300 for a few days now, but my experience for the most part has been positive even with a rough firmware. Also, I usually base my router purchases by SNB reviews, but in this case I am having different results, so I'll stick with R6300 for now.

The materials used are excellent.  The design shows significant attention to detail.And yet... the damn things are just too bulky for me.With the original iPad I traded this case out for a slimmer lighter version that might not work as well or feel as nice but reduces the bulk.  Sorry, but the original iPad is just too damn heavy already, even without the case!With the iPad mini I do love the flexibility and I think that this style of closure is great.  HOWEVER, the fit isn't as good as it should be--its actually hard to reach the various buttons through the cut out holes.  The power button for example is on a recessed edge and you have to get your finger into the hole between the two sheets of leather quite a ways to get at the thing.  Ditto the volume buttons.

I've ordered my fair share of displays through Amazon over the years and have always done so confidently as their return policy and procedure is fantastic. I am glad to say I have no reason to return this display.Again, the display is very sturdy and solid. The elevation mechanism is true and the rotation works perfectly, though I will probably be mounting it sooner or later on one of my Ergotrons. Lastly, I love the bezel. I prefer a nice thin bezel and this one looks great. Perfect for a multi-monitor set-up.FTR, I am using it with a late 2012 Mac Mini in a Dual Display configuration.EDIT: Two more things:1) As far as light bleed is concerned, when the black screensaver comes on I do see bleed on the corners as is common with this kind of monitor. During use, however, I have yet to notice anything at all. It only seems to be an issue when the screen is dark which it never is in my workflow. YMMV.2) I have a hard time using some LED-lit monitors including a Viewsonic that my wife recently got. The text is constantly shifting around and the whole thing bothers my eyes.

B002SGATH8,hot,How a heating problem can be solved in a notebook computer?,"I have a 14"" Dell Latitude E5420 w/Core i7.When running CPU intensive processes, the laptop used to get very hot and you could hear the poor little fan struggling to keep things cool. In fact, once while playing NFS: Hot Pursuit (The newest one) the laptop actually went into thermal protection because the CPU crossed 100 degrees (Celsius).On idle, without the fans, it holds steady between 55 and 60 degrees.With fans I'm usually between 38 and 46.So we can easily say this is more than a 20% decrease in heat. And as we know with electronics, the cooler it is, the more efficient it works.I placed one fan directly under the CPU and the other under the RAM.These fans are extremely quiet, so you'll actually forget that they're on!I also disagree with the person that stated that this item cannot be used on one's lap due to the open back design. The fans come covered. And even then, the pad is at an angle so they don't even touch my legs if I'm on the bed. Also, if it's hot, using the laptop on your lap actually helps to keep your legs a bit cooler as well!Be very careful with the fans as you dismount and remount as the clips that hold them in place do seem to be rather cheaply made and will probably break very easily.Also, be gentle with the USB power plug. It also seems to be cheaply made and may break with too rough a use.All in all I have already recommended this product to a friend and would suggest it to anyone whose laptop gets to hot to stay on your leg.I also recommend this highly over the other coolers that have one big central fan.

B009B0MZ1M,perfect,How is the camera?,"My wife and I are birders and are always on the look for a camera with great zooming ability that is still sufficiently light to carry. We have owned Canon's prior model, the SX40, for just 2 months and loved it. When the SX50 came out, we were tempted, but skeptical about the faster auto focus and the additional zooming ability. We decided to give it a try. The verdict: Canon managed to noticeably improve on an already excellent product, and we bit the bullet and bought the new model.Here are our observations:General impression: the camera is light, has a nice grip, and takes amazing bird pictures even with free hands. The image quality further improves with the aid of a light tripod. When it comes to landscape pictures, the image is less ideal (less sharp) comparing to those taken by Canon S95, a compact camera we own. So our solution is to carry both cameras (both are so light) if we want to have excellent pictures for birding/wild life and landscape.Below is a direct comparison between SX50 and SX40:Auto focus: It really is much faster and more reliable than the SX40's. This is a big deal, particularly for taking pictures of birds.1200mm zoom: This sounds too good to be true for free-hand shooting with a compact camera and in a way it is. At some point cropping yields better results than zooming. So I was skeptical whether SX50's extra zooming ability would really add any value compared to the SX40. Some extensive testing revealed that the SX50 performs equally well as the SX40 at the same (840mm) zoom level. When zooming in further, there is some additional resolution (sharper image) compared to cropping. However, the added value is small and disappears in all but at the very best lighting conditions.Aperture: The aperture numbers are less than stellar: 3.4W-6.5T. Keep in mind though that at 1200mm poor aperture numbers are simply a fact of life. Also worth mentioning: At around 840mm, the aperture is the same as the SX40's, so no loss there. That being said, I would not recommend using this camera except for its amazing zooming ability. In the standard or wide angle range most any compact camera will deliver better results than the SX50.In summary, the SX50 is an amazing camera if used for the special purpose that it is good for. This includes birding, wild life photography, and anything else that really needs zooming in to the max. However, this is not an all-purpose camera. If your main need is to take amazing landscape pictures, other compact cameras would be a better option. (For higher quality images, we use Canon S95 or 5D depending on weight restrictions).Worth mentioning: Before we purchased our SX40, we also tested Nikon P510. SX40 outperformed P510 in auto focus (speed & reliability) and picture quality (sharpness).Useful accessories to greatly improve image quality:- Sirui T-1204X: ultra lightweight and super sturdy tripod, essential to keep the ISO low.SIRUI 4 Section Pro Carbon Fiber Tripod T1204x with Professional Travel Bag- Sirui G-10 ball head: lightweight and smooth. Total weight with the T-1204X is about 2.5lbSIRUI G-10 29mm Ballhead with Quick Release, 40 lbs Load Capacity- Canon remote switch: to avoid shaking caused by pushing the shutter release button.Canon Remote Switch RS60 E3 ANSWERNOTFOUND",camera with great zooming ability,"(59, 92)"
B002C7481G,great,How many wins do you have in this game?,"Before buying my iPad, I spent about an hour in the Apple store playing with it.  I knew I'd get some real use from it, and I knew that it met many of my wants for an ultraportable computer, but the tiny underpowered thing costs almost as much as a macbook!Obviously, I laid down my credit card and walked out of the store with it.  The store is near my office but three hours from my home.  I must admit, I had regrets in the three hour drive home.  A $900 10"" iPod touch?  Am I nuts?After owning and using it for two weeks, I no longer regret the purchase as much, but I still feel that it is overpriced.  My model is the 64GB with 3G+Wifi.  I spent about $900 including tax to buy it at the Apple store and another ~$60 on ""HD"" apps including the iWork suite: pages, numbers, and keynote.  I do have an iPhone so I already owned a lot of apps that work with the tablet.I have found myself using it mostly for four things: document viewing for work, email, web browsing, and games.I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've been using it for games, but I have played several and really enjoyed them.  I'm not a ""gamer"" at all.  I own a Wii that only gets used for watching Netflix movies on my television.  Video games are usually boring to me.  There are quite a few games designed for adults filled with puzzles and brain teasers that will change your view of computer games.  No matter who you are or how adult you think you are: you will wind up using this thing for games.  It's too fun to play games on it not to.  I recommend Labyrinth 2 HD, Osmos HD, Pinball HD, tChess Lite, and a good Solitare game.Back to getting work done: it's pretty great for email.  I have a work blackberry and a personal iPhone.  I get lots of spreadsheet and other document attachments.  Blackberry is terrible at displaying documents.  Iphone does an OK job.  This thing is a desktop replacement as a document viewer.  It isn't as good as having MS office on a PC, but you can definitely get a great view of a document with a lot of formatting intact.  It isn't really better than iPhone for viewing messages, but viewing attachments on the big screen is worlds better.  The only complaint I have about email is that it lacks the ability to thread conversations and show all email inboxes in one list like the ios4 iphone devices.  It will have those abilities this fall when it gets upgraded to ios4, but for now switching between inboxes is a bit awkward.More on document viewing.The biggest help to me at work is document viewing.  I can carry promotional materials, examples of past promotions, old communications, files for reference, presentations, price lists, spec sheets, manuals, photos, trade journals, books, and any other digital document imaginable and access them all easily when with a customer or simply to find info to make me more effective.  The iPad does not include a file system like finder or windows explorer.  The iWork apps have a documents folder, but those folders are not accessible by other apps.  All of the apps include a shortcut to open a document in other apps, but not having a universal finder app is annoying.  If you are in mail you can choose to open an attachment in Pages then email any changes back to the person, but it goes against the way we have all become accustomed to working on PCs and Macs.  There are file system and viewer apps.  I've tried two I like and one that I highly recommend: Goodreader.  Goodreader gives you a place to organize your files into folders for various projects and info.  It has viewers for office file formats, PDF files, and limited graphics files (sorry, there are no eps, ai, or similar art viewers for ipad that I've discovered yet).  Goodreader allows you to transfer files to the ipad via wifi networking, wifi using a web browser on a PC or Mac, using the USB cable, or using itunes.  Best thing about Goodreader: it's only one dollar.The built-in photos app is great.  I used my mac to convert a lot of documents to jpgs just so I could use the photos app to view and display them.  Integration between the photos app and the iwork apps and mail is great.  Syncing albums between a Mac or PC and the Photos app is a snap.  The photos app is where the ""magical"" in the ads comes from.  It is a delight to browse images using the app.  I'm sure you can find countless youtube videos demonstrating it if you look.  For under five dollars, you can buy Photogene or a similar app for useful photo editing on the ipad.Web browsing is the other ""killer app.""  Lots of people complain that iPad doesn't support flash, but I honestly don't miss it.  Most big web sites recognize that you're using an ipad and deliver non-flash versions of videos.  My biggest concern is the lack of RAM in the ipad.  The lack of RAM shows when web browsing.  If you switch between open pages, most of those pages will be reloaded because it doesn't cache much; it can't cache much with only 256mb of ram.  As long as switching between pages, and having them reload when doing so isn't a huge issue to you, web browsing on the ipad using Safari is a desktop-like experience.  I have just recently started using a third party browser called ""Atomic Web.""  Atomic web adds useful multitouch gestures, tabs, full screen, and adblock to the Safari browser.  I highly recommend Atomic Web for the $2 they charge for it.  It works great.The app store lets you add tons of functionality to your machine.  Count on spending $50+ depending on what you want to do with your machine.  I love the three $10ea iWork apps, the $5 photo editor, the handful of $5-$10 games I own, and the multitude of free periodical reader apps I downloaded.Watching and listening to media in ipad is really great.  The iPod interface looks like an older version of iTunes on a Mac.  Video looks great.  I've always been a fan of desktop itunes for syncing with ipod and iphone.  Ipad is exactly like iphone and ipod when interacting with the desktop.  The built in speakers in ipad are louder and sound better than iPhone and iPod touch.  They are nearly as loud as the ones on my Macbook Pro 13"".  The speakers are great for listening to podcasts or watching a movie in bed or in your comfy chair.Google maps and google earth are a desktop-like experience on ipad.Battery life is where ipad kicks laptop tail.  I easily get 8+ hours from a charge.Typing on ipad in landscape mode is about like typing on a netbook; you wouldn't want to write a long document on it but it's fine for email and composing short documents and memos.  It's a lot better than I expected.  Typing in portrait mode is a bit of a chore.You WILL need to buy a case for it.  The ""acase"" brand ipad case that sells for $26 here at Amazon is a great choice (and the highest rated case on Amazon).  You will not be able to find an Apple case for it.  Apple cannot meet demand for ipad accessories.  The camera connection kit (usb and card reader) are also impossible to find.I'm glad I bought the largest (64GB) model.  I currently only have 25GB free after putting in 20GB of music, 8GB of films, 5GB of apps, and around 2GB of documents.  64 GB is really very ideal, but anything less would be crowded unless you don't plan to use the ipod or video player much.I bought the 3G service for it and don't regret it.  I live in the midwest and ATT has decent service here.  I am paying $15/month (no contract) for 256MB.  2GB is available for $25/mo.  I bought the cheaper plan because I have frequent access to wifi, but wanted the ability to look at email adn documents on the road if the occasion arises.  So far just using 3G for email and very infrequent browsing 256mb is plenty.  I highly recommend buying a 3G model unless you are sure that you will always have Wifi access when you use it.  It's a lot less useful if you can't connect to the web.In conclusion, this thing is very useful and very expensive.  I use it a lot.  I use my PC and my Mac a lot less now.  I carry it to places that I wouldn't consider lugging a PC to.  It allows me to carry a lot more info and digital files than I ever did before.  It makes me more effective and allows me to travel lighter.  Is it worth slightly over $1000 after buying a case and apps?  I'm still not 100% sure.  Do I love it?  yes.

B0088CJT4U,wireless,How is the card?,"So this was half the price of the Netgear Nighthawk. I found that TP-Link tends to last more than a year. I replaced this a month ago, so time will tell how long this router lasts.Comparisions with the netgear nighthawk is that this is a little slower but hardly noticable. I wish TP-Link had USB3.0 instead of just USB 2.0. I found that TP-Link's firmware does a better job of identifying the distances of devices and adjusting power to the signal accordingly. Negear did not come close to this. I was around 50 feet away and would get a fair signal on netgear. With TP-link I have an excellent signal once it detects my laptop in the room that is further out. For power consumption Netgear Nighthawk I measured at eating about 10-15W. This runs nominally at 4-5 watts. I think the netgear's issue on power consumption is that it has a dual core 1 Ghz Processor.I will update my review as the months past and this router performs. So far it's working great, but as like most routers the first 3 months are the honeymoon. The problems coming 6 months or so later ;). ANSWERNOTFOUND",Nighthawk,"(42, 51)"
B00001WRSJ,awesome,How is the audio bass?,"My sister's Bose headphones finally died and so, her being a super audiophile without enough money to buy the high-end stuff, i gave her my JVC HA-RX700 and she loves them even more than the Bose. So that left me with nothing, and therefore i decided to undertake the quest to find the best headphones for under $50 that I could. I looked at so many headphones, and i still loved my JVC's, but i decided i should probably try something new. and then i found these...I would say that I am...an untrained-audiophile of sorts and have just recently started to be pickier about my headphones. i can pick out minute differences in music and how headphones represent them if i really want to, but it doesn't exactly ""bother"" me terribly when bass is muddy or treble is harsh, etc. That being said, i loved my JVC's and was sad to see them go, but I've gotta say, i love these bad boys even more. I think it's the bass that separates them...it's punchier and more...accurate, you know? without being overly done. out of the box they had a bit too much sibilance (i think that's the right word), but they've broken in a bit and it's less harsh in that range. but the bass...wow. otherwise they're very similar in my opinion to the JVC's. The treble might be a tad better, but not much if at all. I don't know enough of the proper wording to describe much more about it, but that's my two cents. They're also very comfortable, not too tight or anything and very soft padding. I highly recommend them, i can't imagine headphones getting that much better. i've heard Beats by Dre, Bose, and the JVCs, and these are just the best of all of them to me.

B00BGGDVOO,new,How do you like the tv?,"Today is my first day with the Roku 3. I was able to find a factory refurb with a full warranty + included cables for about 15 bucks cheaper than the Roku 3 alone on Amazon. I'm using the money I saved to purchase an extended warranty. I love Amazon, but I recommend shopping around. I would have settled on the Roku 2 had I not found that deal! So, I basically paid a little over the price of a Roku 2 for a Roku 3 with cables, and once I buy the extended 2 year warranty, I'll have paid slightly more than a brand new Roku 3 with a weak 90 day warranty.Netflix became my main source of entertainment after I cut down on the amount of TV channels I have. Unfortunately, I rarely got to use Netflix after my good computer crashed. Since then, I've been operating an old nearly outdated laptop, and it works for most of my daily needs (social media, mostly) so I haven't felt the need to upgrade and replace it yet. However, it's had issues loading Netflix from time to time, so I began looking into streaming media players. That, plus the fact I have a nice flat screen I was gifted a couple Christmases back that's been going to waste. Why have a nice TV if all you can use it for is basic cable?Enter the Roku, the ideal option for someone who cares more about having content to watch (or listen to) than playing games or anything else. We have an Xbox in the living room which is fine and dandy, but I barely use it myself and it wasn't worth it to me to buy a gaming system for movies/TV alone when I could just buy a media player. Plus, the Roku does have some more simple games, like Angry Birds, which is really cool.Set up is simple, it boots up quickly and navigation is easy. If you have Netflix and Hulu you'll have more shows and movies than you could ever watch for under 20 bucks a month. I've been running the Hulu trial and will definitely be purchasing it when it runs out.I did have one issue where it locked up and reset itself already on day 1. I was worried that this was an issue because it was a refurb, but I did some investigative work and found out that it's a fairly common issue with Rokus and it's related to software, not hardware.I'm not too fussed about it, everything else is going fine, and if it becomes a recurring problem, well, that's what warranties are for.If you've got the extra money, the Roku 3 is great, though I was going to go with the 1 or 2 until I found a deal on the 3. I hear it has a better interface than the other models but I can't confirm, and there's also Youtube access, but that's said to be coming on the other models in the near future, so really, any Roku will serve the average consumer well! Just know that the 3 only has HDMI output option, so if you have an older TV, you'll need to go for the 1 or 2. You might be able to get it to work with an HDMI to analog converter, but I don't have firsthand experience with that.I don't know if it's worthy of the upgrade if you have another Roku, but if you're looking for a new one anyway and have the extra cash (as I said, if you look around you can get a refurb for cheaper with a fully warranty on a certain widely known competitor of Amazon), then I'd definitely get the Roku 3.

B009A5204K,important,How was the sound?,"I need to do a lot of teleconferencing on the road.  Most of these phone meetings are with people in other countries (i.e. some accent), and they usually use a speaker phone instead of individual headsets.  I have been using a one ear Bluetooth headset, and could hardly hear what they were saying.  I need a headset that covers both ears.  So, I bought this headset because of its good reviews.The sound quality of this headset is wonderful.  I can now hear people's conversation much better than before.  It comes with ear pieces of 3 different sizes.  I really like the ear pieces as they fit into my ears very well and block most of the outside noise.  For headphone sound quality, I'll give it 5 stars.However, the microphone quality is not that good.  It is very sensitive and pick up a lot of background noise.  People can hear me clearly if I'm indoor in a quiet room, but if I'm outdoor usually they have problem hearing me.  One of my coworkers is using the 700 model, and he complains the same thing.  For microphone quality, I'll give it only 2 stars.I have also been using this headset a lot when I do exercise (elliptical machine/jogging).  It's light weight, and its Bluetooth connection is very good.  I can put my phone 15 feet away and enjoy my music.

I'm a cross fit / weightlifter who listens to all music, but primarily hip-hop / R&B; during workouts, running, cycling, etc. I was in a debacle trying to determine whether to get these S4s or the Bose IE2 (StayHear tips).  I've heard reviews claiming that each one is better, so I initially bought the Klipsch, then decided to try the Bose.  Here's what I found:PROS:- Overall the sound is great, the highs are good, mids are decent, bass is just OK --- not impressive (which is why I give it 4 stars and not 5), I'd say the sound is better than the IE2s.- Noise-cancelling - when I put these in, I don't want to hear any other sounds (e.g., the gym, other people, noise, etc), I want to be submersed in my own world.  For this reason, these are way better than the Bose IE2's, which ARE NOT NOISE CANCELLING.  When I tried the IE2's, I couldn't concentrate on my workout as I still heard normal noises, chatting, weights dropping, the A/C, etc.  For this reason alone, I am selling my 5 day old IE2's for a loss.CONS:- Bass is not impressive, it's just decent.  My old Sony's had better bass.- Although it comes with 3 sizes, the silicone is just a bit awkward and doesn't fit in my ear securely, so i sometime have to adjust it while running or doing other activities.

These cables are thick and feel durable.As far as performance goes, I haven't noticed any lag or problems for either 3D gaming or 3D Blu-ray movies.The shipping was fast. The cables came in minimal packaging (no excessive plastic shells to cut through or overload of marketing garbage that tell you zero about the technical specs.The price was what HDMI cables should cost.  I'm not sure why Blu-ray and HDTV manufacturers can't include an HDMI cable with their products; it has to cost about the same to manufacture an HDMI cable as it does to make the set of composite cables they still include for some reason.

I usually don't like getting e-mails from companies about products, but this one was short and to the point.  It thanked me for my purchase, and listed a customer support number, should I encounter any problems.  There was no mention of their other products or services; no attempt to sell me warranties or anything else I'm not actively looking for.It's nice to see a company put customer service and satisfaction ahead of their investors and shareholders.

B0074WDDN8,fantastic,How is the image quality?,"The Olympus OM-D E-M5 (quite a mouthful) costs as much as a mid-level DSLR and after reading glowing reviews from photographers saying they replaced their DSLR for this camera I had unreasonably high expectations. Don't get me wrong, I love this little camera. The AF is insanely fast and accurate and the image quality is great. Here is the list of pros and cons I could come up with.Pros:- Super fast AF. Around the same speed as my Nikon D7000 and probably more accurate. It almost never missed focus.- Lightweight and small. Other have said with the pancake lens it will fit in your pants pocket. They must have really big pockets. There's no way I can fit it with the pancake lens on into a jean pocket. A jacket pocket sure, but not my pants.- Weather sealing!- Touch screen. This is an awesome feature. I can give my wife the camera and tell her to tap the screen on someones face and it takes the picture perfectly in focus.- Lots of lenses to choose from.- Image quality is really good.- Low light noise is pretty amazing for a sensor this small. If you're showing pics on the web, ISO 1600 and 3200 look great and I don't hesitate to use either. ISO 25600 is a marketing trick, it looks like my son drew a water color painting, ISO 12800 isn't great either.- It's built like a tank- The electronic viewfinder is a really nice addition although it's not as nice as an optical viewfinder on any DSLR I've ever used.- Large high quality LCD on the back- Battery life is very good. I took around 300 shots over a three day period and it was still at 3/4 full battery.- The way they positioned the two command dials works perfectly. The thumb and pointer finger rest on both allowing easy access to changing settings.Neutral:- The menu system is neither great nor terrible it just takes some getting used to.- The Buttons are mushy feeling and very small. The camera is small so it's kind of what I expected.Cons:- The included external flash is really weird. It's this tiny little thing you have to carry around in a pouch and it's really awkward to attach it to the camera. They should have just moved the viewfinder over to the side and put a flash in the camera with a hotshoe on top. It's a direct flash and doesn't allow you to pull it back and bounce it. I probably won't use it much if at all.- It's bit hard to firmly hold if you have big hands. I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it if I hold it with 1 hand. The grip could be improved.- The metal strap connectors are in a weird place and you have to put them in between your fingers to grip the camera.- The price was a little hard for me to swallow. For what you get it's probably the right price but it's still a lot of money.- This camera does not give DSLR quality images. I can easily spot any pic from my D7000 over a pic from the Olympus. The images are fantastic, don't get my wrong. But the look of the pictures from the camera is a little flatter and less 3 dimensional than a DSLR. It's hard to explain but the bigger sensor in bigger cameras does make a difference in image quality.Final ThoughtsYes the image quality is fantastic but for me this camera does not replace my Nikon D7000. Pictures from my Nikon just look slightly more realistic and have more pop to them. I bought this camera because I hate lugging my DSLR around. It's big and bulky and I never take it hiking or fishing with me. I wanted something that had close to DSLR quality images but in a tiny package I could carry everywhere. I wanted fast and accurate AF and I wanted it to be easy enough for my wife to use. I also wanted interchangeable lenses. With the Olympus I got everything I asked for. No it's not a DSLR replacement like I had hoped it would be. I wouldn't shoot weddings with this camera.

B008F4NL04,responsive,What receptivity does the touch screen have?,"I'm going to start by saying that I really don't get the people that complain about light bleed! So far, I have owned this tablet for only a week but I have owned previous tablets longer than that. I have to say that my Toshiba tablet had NO light bleed to speak of. The sound on that one wasn't real great though. It also had no LED flash for the rear camera. The TF300T is a nice tablet by ASUS but, still no flash for the rear camera and the ""stereo"" speakers are placed far to the right of the back of the tablet as is the same with the TF700T which I am now using. It, however, does have an LED flash, a very bright one I might add. The folks that said the flash wasn't very bright, I don't know whom you were trying to kid. Now, the sound on this tablet isn't as good and rich sounding as the speakers for the TF300T, even though the placement is the same...to the far right in the back. That bothers me a little but not enough to send it back yet.As far as that darn light bleed. Well, this one has one spot towards the bottom that is very noticeable and then a few areas towards the right of the screen that show up also. But you know what people, it is my experience that once that tablet is fully booted up and you have all the images on the screen and the auto brightness has adjusted itself to a mid level, the ""bleed"" is no longer noticeable. I don't understand the people that have huge complaints about it enough to say they returned their tablets because of it. The screen is very nice and very responsive. Even in IPS mode for outside viewing, I can barely tell of any light bleed and it surely isn't enough to project across my screen. If you are out in the bright sun with the IPS mode on and the bightness at full, the sun's rays still block out what you think one could detect as ""light bleed"" so again, I don't understand what all the fuss is about! It's still not bothering me enought to return the tablet. The one I really wanted actually was the Toshiba Excite but the reviews were much lower than this one. I still feel in some way I should've got the Toshiba instead (thus the 4 stars of this tablet). At least it places its ""stereo"" speakers as right and left side speakers and not just all the way on the right side. It also has an LED flash.I'm not really going to comment on what bloat software it comes with becaue I didn't feel it actually has all that much extra apps installed to worry about. I'm also not going to comment on how well it runs all that software. I have found that from tablet to tablet, they all pretty much do the same thing with just a little bit difference in the design. That part is just to each one's own preferance. I've done the system update to the newest android version. The tablet as a whole seems to function well. I would recommend it to my friends but I also would suggest that they might want to research more and and maybe check out the Toshiba Excite or other brands and come to their own conclusions.

B0036AWR8E,large,How is the compartment?,"I recently bought the Slingshot 302AW, hoping to be able to carry two bodies (and some extra lenses and accessories) and still enjoy the fast access of a sling bag.But I cannot find the right configuration for this bag. It is big enough, but the freedom to arrange the internal space is very limited.The main limit is the fixed divider between the upper and the lower compartments.The upper compartment is just a little too small for another body (Sony A700 with VG or Minolta Maxxum 9 with VG with wide-normal lens).The lower compartment is too big for one body, but a little too small for two bodies.After some tries, I managed to fit two bodies in the lower compartment (although the Velcro is very limited), but then I have no fast access to my equipment and I have to take the bag off to get something out.So I don't really understand this bag - if I want fast access for one body, I'll use a smaller bag. If I am giving up the option for fast access and carry two bodies, I will use backpack which is way more convenient.I feel very frustrated - I like this bag, it is very sturdy and comfortable. It is big and has the potential to be exactly what I am looking for. But it is not...AFTER READING THE COMMENTS TO MY REVIEW:This bag might not be designed to carry two bodies. That's true. But the complain is about the fact that the bag is big and has a lot of space, and yet there is no enough space for a setup I can carry with a much smaller bag. Each photographer has his/her own style and his/her own kit. That's why most of the modern camera bags contains dividers that can be moved around. Before I bought that bag I checked how much space it has and I mistakenly assumed that I will be able to use this space as I wish. That is the usual case with camera bags (at least that is the case with the other Lowepro models I own).In that sense, the older versionLowepro SlingShot 300 All-Weather Camera Bag (Black)is better because you can attach the dividers anywhere in the main compartment.

B003ELYQGG,audible,How is it the sound?,the sound is not good and I have to turn the volume up more than half way just to barely hear anything. ANSWERNOTFOUND,the sound is not good,"(0, 21)"
B002DP1FTU,good,How is the detail?,"Sources: iPhone5 with PA2V2/FiiO E07k/Decware Zen Head amps using the LOD, various computers using the Microstreamer/Beyer A200p/v-moda Verza DAC/amps.Review notes: My first impressions of the sound of the SRH440 are based on direct comparisons to other headphones - the v-moda M80 and M100, the Beyerdynamic DT1350 and T51p, the FAD Pandora IV and VI, and notes I've accumulated from many prior reviews. I describe how I relate to the SRH440 (i.e. my personal tastes and how I use the headphone) only after covering all of the objective issues.Summary of sound: It's no coincidence that the SRH440 has such a good soundstage and sense of openness, since those properties are highly dependent on a neutral frequency response that's free of peaks, recesses, and colorations which derive mainly from undamped resonances.My first impression of the SRH440 is neutral sound. But it's much better than that. In my 80-odd headphone reviews, I've used expressions like &#34;fairly neutral&#34; or &#34;basically neutral&#34; etc., but the number of those that I'd play with no EQ whatever were very few: B&W; P7, Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro, FAD Pandora VI, Mad Dog, Sennheiser IE800, and the Shure SRH1840. Compared to those six, the SRH440 gets close to the Mad Dog and the IE800, and has a better signature I think than the other four. In the case of the P7 and Pandora VI, their responses are slightly more 'V'-shaped, but still fine for most genres as is. The Custom One Pro and the SRH1840 are a bit more bland, but also fine for most music genres. The SRH440's (understandable) limitation is its ultimate resolution - the most expensive headphones I've listed here have a subtly clearer sound that's noticeable in direct comparisons, but when the SRH440 is heard on its own, I doubt that very many users would hear the sound as any less than perfect.Some concerns I have with low-cost headphones are inconsistencies in matching the sound between the left and right drivers, and matching the sound between different production samples of the same headphone. When there are any such inconsistencies, a customer may experience a very different sound than what they were expecting based on reviews they've read. Although the SRH440 is only $99 USD currently, every indication I have is for a high quality well-made product. The limitations I notice most compared to the more expensive headphones are the fit and finish - the finish is plain and plastic, but elegant in its simplicity. The earcup fit doesn't feel as though it's making a good seal to my head, which is usually critical for proper bass response, but since the bass is just right anyway, the only issue with the fit is that it's not as luxurious as with the pricier headphones. The SRH440 earpads are quite good, and are a huge step up in quality from (for example) the Sennheiser HD280 Pro earpads.Earcup rotation is no more than a few degrees horizontally. Vertical rotation is 180 degrees, so from the earcup rotations I'd expect the SRH440 to fit a wide range of head sizes. My average-size head fits with the earcups pulled out to click stop no. 4, allowing a 3/4 inch smaller and 5/4 inch larger adjustment to the headband on each side. The long coiled cable is single-entry to the left earcup, and has a proprietary detachable locking connector with a 2.5 mm stereo plug (same as other Shure headphones). The cable is terminated with a standard 3.5 mm miniplug threaded for a 6.35 mm plug adapter (included). A soft plastic carry bag is also included.The comments in the music tracks listed in this review can be compared to other headphone reviews I've done, to get an idea of how the SRH440 plays the different music tracks listed here compared to other headphones. My suggestion is instead of reading each comment below as an absolute unto itself, you could compare these notes to other reviews as they get posted, and see how the SRH440 compares with each individual track.Animotion - Obsession (1980's New Wave/Techno): The upper bass synth has excellent detail and tone with a modest weight, and both male and female vocals sound natural without favoring either. The SRH440 plays this extremely well.Bauhaus - Bela Lugosi's Dead (~1980): Strong midrange sound effects - this is a good worst-case test for resonant-type sounds in the most sensitive midrange area. Handled perfectly by the SRH440.Beethoven Symphony 9, Solti/CSO (1972): Excellent overall sound. Of special note here are the bass impacts beginning around 10:30 of the fourth movement. Those impacts are soft and well in the background, but you can feel some of the weight they carry with the SRH440.Black Sabbath - Iron Man (Classic Rock): Very good instrumental detail and the vocal sounds very natural. As with most classic rock tracks, there is very little or no deep bass. The SRH440 plays this music smoothly, and the lack of deep bass doesn't unbalance the treble.Boz Scaggs - Lowdown (1976): Good sound quality - this is a great test for any nasality in the midrange. Handled extremely well by the SRH440.Cantus - Danny Boy (Traditional/Male Choral/Acapella): The SRH440 plays the voices with enough low end warmth and weight to sound very natural, yet there is no added emphasis of the lower register of the male voices on this track.Cath Carroll - Moves Like You (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's percussion and voice are crisp and well-balanced, and there's a good sense of space or soundstage around the voices and instruments. The SRH440 reproduces the space and detail convincingly.Catherine Wheel - Black Metallic (~1991): Goth with industrial overtones - I like this since it's a great music composition and the sound effects are smoothly integrated into the mix. This may sound distorted or mushy with some headphones, but the SRH440 renders the deliberate instrumental distortions clearly.Chris Isaak - Wicked Game (Pop/Rock): The SRH440 plays this high treble energy recording very smoothly - the voice and instruments are detailed but not sharp or edgy.Chromatics - I'm On Fire (Synth-Pop, female lead): This track has a good amount of space around the voice and instruments, making for a very pleasant stereo image. The voice is excellent and the tambourine sound has better than average tonality.David Hazeltine - Fur Elise (Jazz): A very high-quality recording from HDTracks. The SRH440 reproduces the instruments smoothly with a spacious ambiance. The wire-brush-on-cymbal harmonics are very extended and detailed.Grieg (Beecham-Royal Philharmonic) - Peer Gynt-Solveig's Lullaby (Classical): This very old (late 1950's) stereo recording must have been made on the most expensive gear in the world, since the overall sound quality and especially Ilse Hollweg's amazing voice are as close to &#34;being there&#34; as I've heard with some of the better classical recordings made since the year 2000. The SRH440 plays this music perfectly.Hans Zimmer - Dark Knight-Aggressive Expansion (Soundtrack): The percussion in this track hits really hard, and the bass tones beginning around 0:45 have the ultra-deep &#34;shuddery&#34; kind of sound and feel that indicates a good deep-bass response. Overall, the SRH440 plays this music very well.Heaven 17 - Let Me Go (1980's New Wave/Techno): The bass instrument (guitar?) has very good detail, and the voices and ambiance have a &#34;you are there&#34; quality that's uncommon in early 1980's pop music. The SRH440 plays this track perfectly.Hugo Audiophile - 15-16 (Electronic): I'm not sure what the 15-16 stands for - perhaps track numbers from a CD album. The deep-bass tones that start around 33-34 seconds into the track reproduce extremely well with the SRH440. This is a great recording for evaluating whether a headphone's bass will be sufficient for most environments, since for many headphones that have a weaker bass, the deep bass gets absorbed and mostly lost when the environment contains a lot of low-frequency energy.Human League - Keep Feeling Fascination (1980's New Wave/Techno): This track's bass line is very detailed, but the somewhat forward voices don't have quite the &#34;you are there&#34; quality of the Heaven 17 track noted above.Jimmy Smith - Basin Street Blues (early 60's): This track has several loud crescendos of brass and other instruments that don't sound clean and musical with some headphones. The SRH440 provides excellent detail. Listen particularly to the second crescendo at 15 seconds in for maximum detail effect. I'd like to emphasize that these crescendos are probably the worst-case test I have for instrument separation and detail, and the SRH440 does those exceptionally well.Kellogg Auditorium, Battle Creek Michigan, Aeolian-Skinner Organ (1933) - Pedal, 32', Resultant, Arpeggio: This 16 hz organ pedal tone differs from other music tones in that you won't &#34;hear&#34; the tone - you'll only feel it. Although most music tones have harmonics (including this one), the harmonics from this tone will be too weak to provide any &#34;feel&#34;, so whatever you actually hear would not be part of the fundamental 16 hz tone. There are ~30 hz sounds in the outdoor environment in big cities, generated by large trucks, buses, and subway trains, and they have a quality of &#34;rumble&#34; that's similar to some deep-bass tones found in music. This 16 hz organ tone is easily distinguished from those sounds when compared on a headphone that has good undistorted response at 16 hz. The SRH440 plays this very well.Mantovani - Sunrise Sunset (Easy Listening, ca. 1972): A master musician and conductor who specialized in light classics and orchestral pop music, Mantovani's accomplishments were overshadowed by music critics who couldn't tolerate the notion of &#34;light classics&#34; or &#34;semi-classical&#34; music, even when those recordings were no threat to the classical music genres. In any case the later Mantovani recordings from the mid-1960's through mid-1970's had the advantage of being mixed for much better hi-fi systems than those which the music critics possessed at the start of the Long Playing (LP) record cycle. Here in 2014, at least some of those digital remasters have improved the sound further, although it's not always the case. This track as played on the SRH440 is an excellent example of the sheer musicality lurking in those later recordings, and is highly recommended for soundstage, instrumental tone, and musical balance.Michael Tilson Thomas - Rhapsody In Blue (20th Century Classic): Great sound and soundstage, and terrific piano playing and tone. There are some very deep bass impacts starting around 38 seconds into the 17:24 length track, and the weight of those impacts is subtle but appreciable with the SRH440.Porcupine Tree - Trains (Pop-Rock): This track opens with some nicely-detailed string sounds and a forward-sounding male voice with a higher-than-average register. There are a series of &#34;clip-clop&#34; effects starting at 3:19 that should sound like they were made with wooden blocks of some kind. The SRH440 reproduces those sounds very well.Richard Strauss (Mester-Pasadena) - Also Sprach Zarathustra (opening) (Classical): The granddaddy of bass is in the opening 1:50 of this recording, and I've heard it only once on a large and expensive loudspeaker system in Cleveland. For most people, that experience would be indistinguishable from being in a fairly strong earthquake. The SRH440 conveys as much of that experience as is possible on a more-or-less neutral headphone. The tympani also have good impact here.Scarlatti-Kipnis - Sonata in E Major K381 (Classical, Harpsichord): The harpsichord here is fairly bright and highly detailed, and the SRH440 renders the tones and transients very well.Trombone Shorty - Backatown (Jazz-Funk): The deep bass impacts here are quite strong, and work very well with the horns and other instruments. The SRH440 delivers the impacts with proper weight and detail, and the horns have the kind of bite that gives them a wonderfully realistic sound.William Orbit - Optical Illusion (Billy Buttons Mix) (Electronic): This is about as close as I want to get to easy-listening music. The string tones beginning at 0:18 are fairly soft, and while the bass isn't very deep, it still adds a good underpinning to the music. The short poetic rap at 4:14, preceded by an etherial female voice, works very well with this track. ANSWERNOTFOUND",provides excellent detail,"(8351, 8376)"

B00FFJ0HUE,excellent,What is the quality of the screen?,"The idea of having a Windows 8 convertible with 10+ hours of battery life with Office 2013 included for $400 seemed like a bad infomercial promise, but it turned out to be true for my purposes.  I was looking for a second computer that could do fairly basic Windows stuff and multimedia while also being very compact and having a long battery life.I had previously purchased an Atom-based Asus netbook that was atrociously slow and only lasted a few hours, plus the fan was annoyingly loud.Here are my findings:GOOD:- The T100 is as fast as you need a second computer to be.  MS Office runs smoothly, all videos play well and it's never slowed down terribly so far.  I haven't run any processor-intensive stuff yet like Photoshop or Crisis, but that's not why I purchased it.- The screen is rather nice.  It's an IPS WXGA screen, which pales in comparison to some 1080p phones, but for a 10.2"" netbook, it works well.  Text is readable and videos look great.  The brightness isn't spectacular and the reflectivity is high, but it's very crisp and the viewing angles are excellent.- There are no fans.  It runs cool.  It runs silent.- The speakers are better than my 17"" laptop.  Not great in the bass department, but they're loud.  I just wish they were facing forward instead of backward.- It's super light and compact.  I'm able to read holding just the screen and the whole package, including the keyboard, fits nicely into the Kensington tablet sling I just purchased.- The construction is solid.  Yes, the lid and screen are smudge-prone, but it's all solid state and thoughtfully arranged...for a $400 piece of hardware.BAD:- The WiFi is a bit wonky.  When I wake my computer, sometimes the WiFi won't work but when I just turn the laptop's WiFi antenna off and on, everything goes back to normal.- The charger is as slow as people are reporting.  Sometimes it charges fairly slowly, other times, not at all.  Still working that out.- The trackpad is annoying and unpredictable.  Once I turned off the tap-to-click feature, it was much more manageable except the trackpad clicks are conspicuously loud.  Remedied by a bluetooth mouse.OTHER THOUGHTS:- I appreciate the microSD slot.  I put in a 64GB chip and it works great.- Some have complained about the single-antenna WiFi, but it hasn't bothered me at all.  Streaming music and video is not a problem.- The tablet doesn't fit in immediately so you kind of have to wiggle it in so it will fit flush with the keyboard.- Windows 8.1 presents a learning curve.  It's also not the greatest OS for a tablet computer.  But once you get used to the quirks, it's not a dealbreaker.- The keyboard is small but totally usable.  With its weird layout and lack of backlighting, it's not great in the dark, but otherwise, it's fine.IN SUM:For me, this computer does everything I expect it to do.  It's tiny, relatively fast and the battery life is tops.  That said, there are many idiosyncrasies that you must contend with.  WiFi, keyboard and charging require some fiddling, but maybe those things will be ironed out in future updates.All in all, it's a great piece of hardware.  If you're looking for something that has the portability of a tablet but the functionality of a laptop for $400, it's an amazing deal that can't be beat.  For the price, there are better laptops and there are better tablets, but as a low-priced combo, it's a grand slam. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The screen is rather nice,"(777, 802)"

B004NY9UV4,thick,How thick is the material of the bag?,"I love Case Logic products, I have several different items they make, and this one is very nice as well.I purchased this to protect my Samsung Series 7 Slate PC and it does a great job.  The material it is made from is soft and thick enough to protect the slate from inadvertent pokes and bumps.The one negative aspect (and maybe with use it will stretch a bit) is that the zippered opening is about 1/16th of an inch (or about 1.5mm) too small.  I have to be very careful not to accidentally hit the power button when putting it inside (certainly the slate will turn off in a few minutes, but it will be hotter than heck by the time it does) and it take a bit more force to coax the slate out when I want it.I do not believe it is water-proof, however, I have run from the car in the rain with it, and it did not soak through. I was in the rain for about 10 seconds and it was not a deluge, so I would not assume that your contents would survive unscathed from something more than a few splashes of water, but usually that is all should be allowed to hit anything holding electronics anyhow.If the opening stretches with time, I will update this review (and probably raise the stars), but for now it offers good protection for my slate PC.

B00906HNZU,sturdy,How is the base?,"I love quality displays. I really do. While I don't get into the realm of the insanely expensive professional monitors, I really appreciate a good IPS/PLS monitor. And here's another one.Surprisingly, getting the monitor out of the box wasn't as easy as I'd have hoped. The stem of the monitor (the part that attaches to the stand) is sort of wedged (gently!) against a piece of foam, so it took a little bit of wiggling to get the screen out. If you have someone to help, this would go much more easily!Putting the monitor on the stand took just a few seconds. It hand-screws in, and has a very solid base. It's also an extremely ugly, huge base, and absolutely my one major gripe with the monitor.But let's focus on the good stuff first:For reference, this was tested on a 2011 MacBook Air via mini-Displayport to Displayport (2560x1440), and with a Google Chromecast via HDMI (1920x1080).1.) Pre-calibrated out of the box. Given that my screen came with a specific-to-this-serial-number piece of paper documenting the factory calibration, I was extremely impressed with the output.2.) The controls on the bottom right of the screen are touch sensitive. Normally I'm not a fan of such buttons, but these are without a doubt the most responsive touch-buttons I've used on a monitor. Really good stuff.3.) The screen isn't matte, and it isn't glossy. It's a really excellent combination of the two, cutting down on the glare of a glossy display, while maintaining those rich colors and good contrast.4.) Viewing angles, like many/most IPS panels, is truly excellent.5.) Able to rotate the screen 90 degrees, and it does line up perfectly straight when locked into that 90-degree position. Also, the height adjustment is superb, with plenty of height for me, and I'm 6'5"".6.) No dead/stuck pixels on the monitor I received. Good!7.) No PWM-dimming flicker (if you're sensitive to this, you'll be glad to know!), and no buzzing or other untoward noises from the display at any brightness.8.) While certainly not specifically a gaming monitor, it definitely holds its own. My gaming monitor of choice is myEIZO Foris FS2333-BK 23-Inch Screen LCD Monitor, but if you want something bigger without the viewing-angle deficiencies of TN panels, this would not be a bad choice for the less hardcore PC gamers among you. I wouldn't recommend it for 1080p gaming since the scaling to 1440p can be quite ugly.9.) You can turn off the blue power LED when the monitor is in use, from the Settings menu. I really don't like unnecessary LEDs, so this is something I immediately looked for and was glad to find.And now, the cons:1.) The base of the stand is horrible. I'm not sure what Viewsonic were thinking, but surely somebody could have come up with something a little less of an eyesore. I'll be mounting the screen on a VESA mount (100x100), but still - ouch! So ugly, and it takes up a huge amount of room on the desk for no apparent reason.2.) The brightness is set far, far too high out of the box (maxed out). All this did was draw attention to a little light bleed on the left of my particular display, only view-able on a completely black image. After the brightness was turned down to a less eye-searing level, this was (mostly) gone.Overall, though, this is a top-notch monitor, and highly recommended.5 stars out of 5.

B0096YOQRY,functional,How is the remote?,"The picture is pretty GOOD. I'm not going to say great but it's pretty good for the price. I did some extensive homework before I bought this as I was looking for a smart tv that offered an alternative to hooking it up to several components for a guest bedroom. Instead I liked it so much that I ended up putting this in my bedroom and switching it out with a slightly older Sylvania flat screen I had (great picture) for the guest room. The slim, sleekness of it takes a little getting used to in terms of the screen- you have a thinner frame and more screen to look at if that makes sense. The apps and streaming are pretty good for what you get and Vizio is constantly updating to add more apps. There is a slight learning curve when trying to link it up with your wifi however I found that by turning it off & on after the initial info is entered helped in terms of getting the tv to connect. It took two tries for me but afterwards it was smooth sailing. Again the Netflix, Hulu and other apps are good. There's some interesting freebie channel apps where you can watch old tv shows in there too at no cost so that's kind of nice to have. My favorite feature of this television hands down is the ability to plug in a usb drive and play multiple types of video files automatically without having to hook it up to a PC or DVD player. You can also play mp3 files and look at photos, etc. but I was really impressed by the number of files it would play without too much of a problem. The remote that comes with the TV is a sore spot here and I'll tell you why. They provide you with a smart tv that allows you to access online streaming and other applications yet you get this remote that is more for a basic TV with no buttons such as for launching Netflix or other hotkeys for the streaming apps it offers. This is where Vizio literally Cheapens out this model. The remote is also small, lengthy and complicated in terms of a million tiny keys. There is also no keyboard. You would think that a smart tv would come equipped with a remote that offered a keyboard yet it does not. I realized this is part of the reason why this tv is a bit of a bargain compared to other smart TVs out there. At any rate, I resolved this by replacing the remote with the VIZIO XRV1TV Qwerty keyboard remote (bought here on Amazon for about $12). I know this is not ideal for some because the idea is that you get a brand new tv and you shouldn't have to spend extra $$ on an additional remote however I recommend it in this case as the little cheap universal that comes with this set will drive you mad. You really do want a remote with a Qwerty Keyboard on the back as this will come in handy if/when you do a search on youtube or Netflix or Hulu--you won't be there forever trying to navigate letters on-screen with the up/down remote toggle keys (eyes rolling). Now for the rest of this thing- it's got great picture and some pretty good choice settings for gaming, etc. You just have to get in there and explore it. Some people have complained that the picture looks dimmer than when they saw it on the showroom floor however I just found that I adjusted the controls and it seems to be fine. I believe also that this set has an automatic sensor built-in that adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on the level of light in the room. I have not played with it enough to find out for sure whether or not this is something you can turn off or adjust. There are only two HDMI connections and that can be bothersome to some. For me this wasn't an issue as I don't always hook this up to a PC however it was good to have it hooked up to my cable box but honestly two connections was fine for me. Gamers and PC enthusiasts may get irritated at this small amount of HDMI connections so buyer beware there. Again, this was one of the cheapest smart tv models out there with good reviews that I found so i'm not too surprised it lacks a few things. Some folks have complained at the slowness of the TV to power on and I will say it takes about 20-30 seconds which can get on your nerves. All I can say there is to just have some patience and resist the urge to keep hitting the power switch as I learned the hard way you might actually activate a hard-reset of the television by doing that. That brings me to mention a safety feature the tv has built-in in the event of a power surge or storm. I came home one evening after a wicked rain storm to find the tv buzzing at me every few seconds after I'd turned it on. It kept making a noise similar to those you hear when a weather bulletin flashes on your screen from your local news, etc. I couldn't get the TV to stop doing this so after trying to adjust the settings for a good half hour and finding no solution to this I did some research on the net and found this was a result of a built in sensor that is designed to protect the TV from shorting out if an electrical surge occurs (which apparently did). So the solution to this was to power it off and unplug it from the power source for a good 20 minutes. Once we did this, it came right back on and adjusted to normal as if nothing had happened. Overall it's a very interesting unit with good picture and a fairly good amount of &#34;smart&#34; apps for an entry level smart tv.

B00834SJNA,fast,How is the usb?,"I purchased this as part of a holiday special because I was out of space on my internal storage drive.  This was a quick 2 wire setup (one to power, one to an open usb 3.0 slot on the back of my tower) and i was good to go.  The drive set itself up and I was copying files over within a couple of minutes.  I moved all of my sports recordings to this new drive overnight and it finished itself up while I was sleeping.

B009F1JL5A,light,How heavy is the laptop?,"So, after reading hundreds of computer reviews, I decided to go with this Asus.  I was impressed that a touch screen would be fairly affordable (similar non-touch laptops were in the $500-600 range, so this wasn't a big jump).  I was also excited about the hybrid hard drive, so I took the plunge and bought it.First of all, it's a gorgeous computer.  The brushed black back is lovely and the computer is sleek and smooth and beautiful.  I was already in love when I took it out of the box.  It's light--4 lbs--and super easy to fit into a backpack or even a large purse.  I turned it on, set up Windows 8 (which is initially confusing as heck, even for someone who is totally comfortable using computers), and I started playing with the apps so that I could get a sense of how well the touch screen worked.  I had no problem using the gestures, like pinch to zoom, two-finger scrolling, and panning.  It's as sensitive as any tablet I've used.  Wonderful!  I did briefly have trouble with the touchpad, but after installing all the Asus updates and Windows 8 updates, all is well.  You can do all of the same gestures on the touchpad, by the way.  And the touchpad is huge!  I like it, but it's different than what I'm used to.Okay, so on to the other stuff.  Just so you know, I am a PhD student, so I often have multiple programs open: Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Adobe Reader, etc.  I don't require the kind of CPU and memory as someone who does more intensive computing or gaming, but I do notice when things begin to lag.  Things I care about: USB 3.0 (there is one), the touch screen, the sound quality, and ability to run 3-6 programs smoothly and quickly.  As I said, the touch screen is great.  The sound quality is also surprisingly good, and it gets significantly louder than my old laptop.  With headphones plugged in, the sound is excellent, even at the lowest volumes (I've been listening at approx. 12% volume).  And the computer has been great with multiple programs.  I have only had it for a few days, but I've been putting it through the ringer.  So far, it's passed with flying colors.  It's gorgeous, it runs smoothly and quickly for my needs, and it seems to be an awesome product.  This computer and I are a match made in heaven. ANSWERNOTFOUND",light--4 lbs,"(497, 509)"
B0074BW614,fast,How is processor?,"I've been an iPad user since the original came out. I also have an iPad 3. I have worked in IT for the past few years so I would say I am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices. With that introduction out of the way, I will be reviewing key points that I have seen touched upon in other reviews. Here goes...BUILDThe device feels nice and solid. I'm a little surprised at how heavy it is, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The rubberized backing is always nice for added grip. It's not as nice as say unibody aluminum, but it's not $500 either.SCREENThe screen is fantastic. But my problem is the same as when iPad got Retina Display, other than the OS, most apps look rather pixelated. A lot of the games I tried are not high definition, at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen. Hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions.LOCK SCREEN ADSYeah there are ads on my lock screen. I'm not sure why this is such a big deal. How much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen? The first thing I thought when I saw the ads is WOW the pictures are really crisp! The ads are there to subsidize some of the $200 price tag. I might pay the $15 to get rid of them so I can customize it, but I might not. I feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers.SOUNDThe sound from the speakers is great. Much better than you would get from more expensive devices, very crisp and clean. I have the official Amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all. Nothing much else to say, I doubt anyone will complain about this.CRASHINGI've had two apps crash on opening. I don't know if it is the app or the OS. It's probably somewhere in the middle. Again, not a big deal for me. If it crashes, then I just tap it again and it works. I've also watched a few movies using the built in player as well as Netflix and Amazon Prime. No crashes for me at all. I'm sure OS stability will be improved as time goes on.OVERALL SATISFACTIONCompared to my iPad 3, obviously the Fire HD is not as ""good"" so to speak. I mainly got it because I wanted something smaller. I also mainly used the iPad to surf the web, watch videos, and play some simple games. The Fire HD accomplishes this and does so much more. If you are expecting an iPad killer, or a desktop replacement, or a productivity machine, then you should look elsewhere.I bought this to be a media device, and I believe that is what Amazon meant this to be. In this regard, I think this is a great device. In fact, I decided to keep this and sell my iPad 3, which will give me another $200+ to spend on other things. Just remember, this device is not for everyone. If you want a media device, you will be happy with this. Do not expect an iPad for $200.UPDATE 9/18/12Just wanted to add a few more things I have noticed over the past 24 hours.- Power/Volume Buttons: There are a bit hard to press, which is somewhat alleviated by having the official case. Maybe it's because I'm a longtime iPad user, but this will definitely take some getting used to.- Screen Glare: It took me a little while to notice, but I was playing a Seek & Find game while on Caltrain, with the bright Palo Alto sun shining right on me, and didn't have any trouble seeing the screen. I remembered that Amazon mentioned how the screen was changed to reduce glare, and they did an amazing job.UPDATE 9/20/12Two days later and I am still very happy with the device. Here are some more thoughts from me:BATTERY LIFEI have been playing Enigmatis (a hidden object game) for about an hour and a half each day on my commute. This drains about 15 - 20% of the battery with the screen brightness almost at the highest setting. Again, not iPad gold standard, but still very good.SYNCING MUSICI have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and used an app called Easy Phone Transfer to get all my music from iTunes onto the phone. It transferred everything, including album covers, and I was hoping to find something like that for this device. I tried iSyncr, a $3 app, which did the job, but did not sync over album covers. I uploaded all my music into the Cloud, then downloaded it from Amazon, which increased the audio quality for a lot of my songs and added artwork, but this still did not show up on the device.I got very frustrated getting all the album artwork over and eventually just gave up. It's not a big deal but I am kind of anal about those kinds of things. Just a heads up if anyone else out there is crazy about it like I am.UPDATE 09/21/12I got a call from Amazon Customer Service about this review, which surprised me very much. They advised me the best way to get the artwork to show up is have the songs in both the Cloud Player as well as the device, which I know does work fine. I was hoping to have the artwork show without needing things in the Cloud, but not a big deal any more.I am more impressed with the fact that Amazon called me to give me advice on how to remedy the situation and ask if there were any other questions I had on the Kindle. The representative said he wanted to make sure I was happy with the Fire HD. This is one of the big reasons I went with the Kindle, and with Amazon in general. I have had great experiences with their customer service, who have always been able to handle my issues quickly and efficiently. No need to set up an appointment days later with a wannabe IT guy with a hugely overstated job title.So this update is not really for the device itself, but sometimes it's not just the device, it's the company that offers it that makes a difference. This is why I no longer have any Apple devices, as cool as they may be. But it's not 100% gravy, as I have noticed lately that the keyboard keeps popping up randomly on screens where there is nowhere to enter text, ie. while playing a game. I just have to press the Back arrow to get rid of it, but maybe a bug the Amazon engineers want to take a look at.UPDATE 10/05/12So I don't know if it was always there, but over this past weekend I noticed a dead pixel on my Kindle's screen. I called Kindle Support and after a short 5 minute call, they sent me a new Kindle, no questions asked. So once again, very happy with Amazon customer service. I am still very happy with the device, and have some more thoughts on it:HDMI CONNECTIONI bought an HDMI cable to hook up the Fire to my 46"" Samsung and was quite impressed with the results. The quality was very good, not Bluray quality of course, but better than SDTV on an HD screen. You actually see every single thing you do on the big screen, like you are using a giant Kindle.GOOGLE PLAY APPSOne of the main drawbacks in my opinion is, or should I say was, the lack of all the Google Play apps available on the Kindle. With a little research, I found out how to add apps that are not available in the Amazon store. It is pretty easy to do and works very well with the apps I tried. This greatly improves my opinion of the Fire HD.PLASTIC AROUND THE SCREENThe outer most edges of the Kindle are plastic. I noticed some kind of discoloration on the corner of mine, and just thought it was some dirt to scratch off. So I rubbed my thumb nail on the area, and noticed there were visible marks on the plastic. It appears this plastic can scratch some what easily, but I think this is just cosmetic as not of the plastic actually flaked. If you are not very anal about how your stuff looks, you probably won't notice it.OS CHANGESHere are two small gripes I have with the OS that I'm sure could be fixed with an OS update:- Battery Meter: It would be nice if the battery meter could show percentage instead of just a graphic bar. Some people have mentioned Battery HD, but you still have to swipe down to see the percentage, so this makes it easier but does not solve the issue I had.- Personal Videos: The mp4 videos I put on the device are located in the ""Personal Videos"" app, which shows screen shots of all the videos I put in. The problem is, all that is shown are the screen shots. You can get more info by holding your finger down on each video, but when you have multiple seasons of a show on the Kindle, it can get confusing. Ideally we should be able to look at videos in a list like our music.UPDATE 11/15/12Still very happy with the device. Here are some more thoughts:LEFT HAND MODEI did't think this would be a problem until I played a Solitaire game that DID have a left-handed mode. As a lefty who usually uses the Fire in landscape, I often have to reach across the screen to access the Settings or Home button in the menu. It's a small grievance, but can be really annoying when watching a movie or reading something. If there was an option for a left-handed layout with the menus on the left side of the device, that would be great.PERSONAL VIDEOS APPI had earlier complained about this app, as it did not list my movies and crashed playing a pair of them. I recently drove down to LA from SF, and put 5 movies on device, only to find that 4 of them would not play! I was pretty mad, until I remembered a simple solution, download another app. I downloaded Avia Media Player, which is not the greatest either, but it played all the movies I put on the Kindle. My faith was restored.GOOGLE PLAY APPSA lot of people have asked how to do this. If you are not having luck with Google searches, try this:[...] ANSWERNOTFOUND",think great,"(2476, 2497)"

B002HWRJBM,internal,How is battery?,"This is by far the best mouse I've owned. Stylish and precise, feels great in the hand as well. The one thing I have to complain about is battery life. I use this on a daily basis at work and I find myself having to recharge it once a week. It's not a huge complaints because the included battery is rechargable and you can recharge by plugging a USB cable, but most other wireless mice has a considerably longer battery life. That's the only reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of 5 stars.Also, the scroll wheel had a feature that wasn't obvious to me at first when I looked at the product online: there is a small button next to the scroll wheel which switches between normal scrolling found in other mice (where you hear a grinding noise as you scroll) and a smooth super-fast scrolling (with this, if you spin the scroll wheel fast, it just keeps scrolling freely on its own for a good couple of seconds before it stops!)

B0027VT6V4,better,How is speaker?,"I searched around on Amazon for quite a while and looked up reviews on several speakers all across the internet before finally making this purchase.  I had a set of Bose Companion 2 speakers, and they were nice, but I constantly felt the lack of a subwoofer was leaving me wanting more bass.  These speakers sound decent, but the speakers themselves have absolutely NO bass in them at all.  Thankfully, there is a subwoofer with this set.  On the control knob, you can adjust the speaker volume, the bass level, and there is a headphone jack and auxillery jack.  The speakers are pretty thin so they don't take up much space on my desk.  I have the subwoofer under my desk and so far everything seems to be working out okay.  They get up to a decent volume also.  If you are looking to not spend very much money, these will do the job for you.  If you are looking for absolutely awesome speakers, look elsewhere.  I'd recommend theseKlipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX Certified Computer Speaker System (Black).  I've listened to these in Best Buy and they sound amazing!

B001NJ0D0Y,poor,How is the instruction?,"My old CPU cooler fan was on it's last leg and the whole thing was really caked up with dust, and this is a nice replacement. This is smaller and cools better, probably because it uses copper pipes instead of aluminum like the previous cooler. Fan noise is average, no different than the old fan. I have a big tower case so there is plenty of room for a large cooler like this. With a smaller more compact case you may want to check your clearance first. On the box it says it's 158.5mm tall, 120.0mm wide, 77.0mm deep.I like that the fan easily separates from the fins for cleaning, unlike my old cooler. It just clips on the side using no screws. Big plus for that design. You can put the fan on either side, but you want the air to flow in the same direction as your case fans.Comes with a variety of mounting hardware for different Intel and AMD CPUs. You can also position it to blow vertically or horizontally, depending on which way you want the air to flow. Although the mounting instructions are not that great at first glance, it did not take long to figure out what parts to use and how to use them. If this is your first time mounting a cooler, you don't need/want to overtighten the screws. Just snug will do nicely. You don't want to crack your motherboard and/or damage the internal wiring running by the screw holes. This isn't your car you are working on.I used Arctic Silver 5 instead of the included thermal paste. Go to Arctic's website for the correct way to apply it as it's different for each cpu type. My i7-920 is quad core so it calls for a side-to-side bead instead of a pea-sized drop in the middle. There are how-to videos and pics out there if this is your first time.SpeedFan 4.49 says my idle temp is 35C, and while running Prime95 it goes no higher than 61C. Intel says the absolute max i7 temp is 100C, which if ever reached, the software should shut everything down to protect the chip. Btw, they say it helps to 'burn in' the thermal paste by running Prime95 or whatever, as repeated heating and cooling actually makes the paste work better, but if you don't overclock then that's not really needed.I wanted to move to water cooling but read how some have leaked and the liquid destroyed very expensive video cards (seems they are always mounted below the cpu on a vertical motherboard). I have not heard if the cooler's manufacturers offer any kind of reimbursement for the damage, but who wants the hassle? I'm guessing the only way to avoid that is to lay the desktop on it's side where everything is hanging upside down from the motherboard. I'd rather have my tower case upright so I guess I'll stick to fans. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Although the mounting instructions are not that great at first glance,"(966, 1035)"

My quick response is that I'll keep the Panasonic. Bass, treble, and mids seem pretty decent. Fit in the ear well and for the $6 I spent, great price. The JBuds have slightly better sound but aren't as good for working out but not good enough to pay an extra $14. So if you want to use your earbuds while running/working out, get the Panasonic.

Also the fit is great, it comes with 3 different sizes for comfort which comes in handy when going to the gym. I went through my normal routine with no problem, although haven't tested it on the treadmill yet.One minor, minor complaint: even on low volume, it's hard to hear what's going on in the background because of the shape of the headphones in your ears. (Basically ear plugs) It's great if you ONLY want to listen to music, but if you still want to listen to the background, it's very difficult.I'd still give these headphones 5/5 if it were $10.Update: After about 3 months, the sound sometimes cuts in and out when the wire changes position.

B001QFZMCO,sharp,Does the video and pictures extremely sharp?,"If Canon were to ever be nervous about the competition in point and shoot camera's, they are likely crapping themselves at this moment.  I've owned 5 of the past Canon digital elph's (the most recent the SD790is), and I just returned the Canon SD940is.  I am blown away by the panasonic ZS3!  It does everything the Canon does, and more.  First, the response time of the camera is excellent:  shutter lag is minimal, autofocus is very quick, flash recharge times are quick as well.  I felt the Canon 940 was inferior to even the 790 in shutter lag and autofocus (I was missing shots waiting for the camera to fix on the subject).  The Panasonic has more pleasing photo quality, albeit slightly softer than the Canon.  Colors are more vibrant on the Panasonic, as is overall tone.  I feel like I don't have to mess with the image on the Panasonic like I did with the Canon.  Overall, a great point and shoot.Now for the true differentiating feature.....  This camera doubles as an excellent video camera.  I am blown away by the quality of the video captured in the AVCHD-lite format.  Even in low light situations, the video blows away any other point and shoot, and rivals the super compact $1000 Sony TG-5.  Where it surpasses the TG-5 is in the optical stabilization; the Panasonic shows far less handshake than the TG-5 (which is a huge issue for these ultra compact video cameras).  Finally, there is a point and shoot camera that can capture excellent video for those times where you don't want to drag along a larger video camera.  I own the Sony CX-12 AVCHD camcorder, and the Panasonic is not in the same league as that camcorder.  However, playing the files I shot with the Panasonic on western digital's WDTV via HDMI, video looks fantastic: sharp, vibrant colors with smooth panning.  I would not feel bad trading the portability of the Panasonic, and leaving the Sony camcorder at home (unless I was on a trip to Ireland or something of the like).  The video is truly remarkable for the size of the camera.Also worth noting; Panasonic was very smart to include HD motion JPEG as an option for video recording.  So if AVCHD-lite isn't your thing, you can capture HD video footage in the mp4 quicktime format.  I will say, however, the video is cleaner and smoother when shot in AVCHD-lite.Overall, for the cost of the camera, you cannot go wrong.  It is an excellent point and shoot with very responsive shooting times, and a great portable HD camcorder to boot.  I never thought I would own (or like) a Panasonic camera!Pros:Wide angle lenseExcellent image stabilizationExcellent AVCHD-lite video cameraExcellent shooting timesGreat battery lifeFull Zoom ability while video recordingCons:LCD screen resolution not the crispest I've seenSome images could use sharpeningMenu system a bit cumbersomeLarger than most point and shootsManual exposure in video mode would be nice ANSWERNOTFOUND",the competition in point and shoot camera 's,"(39, 82)"

B0074BW614,good,How time does the battery last?,"Kindle Fire HD 7""Having been an Android and iOS user for the past few years (iPod Touch, iPhone, Motorola Droid2, Samsung Galaxy S3, Kindle Touch, Motorola MotoACTV), I've been anxious to try a Kindle Fire. Going in, I knew it wouldn't be a pure Android ecosystem nor would it have the latest in hardware. I looked at the Google Nexus 7 (Asus) and a Google Nexus 10 as well as the Asus Transformer tablets. The positive aspects of those tablets mainly focus on the Android operating system. Since I'm a fairly heavy consumer of Amazon products and services, the Kindle Fire HD (KFHD) isn't a bad choice.It's easy to navigate, although the Carousel is rather annoying than useful. I prefer Android Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean as it allows far more flexibility and customization. That said, KFHD 7.2.3 is actually based on Android Ice Cream Sandwich, according to Antutu Benchmarks.The Silk Web Browser works much like any other Android browser, and the Kindle Fire integrates seamlessly with your Amazon Cloud services (books, music, movies, etc...) As a Prime member, I can also watch Prime movies in HD. For some unknown reason, Amazon does not allow Prime movies to be played in HD if using a PC - only devices such as the Roku, PS3, Xbox 360, and Kindle Fire allow playback in HD.The KFHD has a micro-USB and micro-HDMI port, with 3 buttons on the side for volume and power. I have a Belkin Chambray case that I first used, but it made the KFHD look and feel cheap. There are lots of cases on the market that use straps to hold the KFHD in place, and then another elastic strap to keep the cover in place. That just looks and feels cheesy. I opted to buy the Amazon KFHD leather case that uses the magnetic closure system. It is perfect! The magnetic flap is exactly what I was looking for! In addition, the buttons work perfectly through the case.The experience of watching a movie on the 7"" screen isn't that great. I prefer watching movies on a larger TV. I also found that reading a book on the KFHD hurt my eyes almost immediately. The lighter background on a LCD causes more strain than the e-ink/pearl screen on the Kindle Touch/Paperwhite. So essentially the KFHD is really more useful for reading magazines, browsing the web, playing games, and perhaps watching a movie/listening to music on the go.The KFDH 7"" has a dual-core 1.2 GHz processor with only 1GB of RAM. I can detect that it is slower than my Samsung Galaxy S3 (1.5 GHz dual-core with 2GB RAM), as it scores only about 6,500 points in Antutu while my Galaxy S3 is at 11,000 points. The screen on the KFHD is crisp. I am able to read magazines using Zinio. In the full page view, the text can be too small although it is good enough for me to skim to find interesting articles.Speaking of Zinio, the Amazon Appstore is probably the sorriest excuse for a marketplace that I've seen. Google Play has far more updated apps. The same apps in the Amazon Appstore are sometimes outdated by several generations, or they simply aren't in the Appstore. I had to sideload Zinio onto my KFHD.I opted to use a regular USB charger, and it takes awhile to fully charge the battery. However, in standby mode it sips power. Another good aspect with the Amazon Onyx case is that the magnetic closure puts the Kindle to sleep (or rather turns off the screen) when the cover is closed without having to do anything else. The battery life is acceptable - the screen is what uses the most power.Overall: 4/5 stars. I have to admit that it is overpriced for what it is, there are better Android-powered tablets (Nexus 7) at the same price point with more hardware power. The Amazon Appstore is sorely lacking compared to Google Play. The 1.2 GHz processor is fairly slow, and there's only 1 GB RAM. The lack of a SD card slot is also a mistake. If you want to read magazines without ever having to zoom in, the KFHD 8.9"" or a 10"" tablet is the answer, but I felt the 7"" is suitable because it is smaller, lighter, and easier to handle.Bottom line is that if you're interested primarily in Amazon content, the Kindle Fire HD is for you. The 8.9"" is best for reading magazines but the 7"" suits me fine. If you plan to root the KFHD, you're better off just buying an Android Tablet like the Nexus 7. The Nexus 7 and other tablets have better hardware (more RAM, faster processor, SD card slot, etc...) ANSWERNOTFOUND",Since,"(491, 496)"
B005HMO6A6,functional,How is the keyboard?,"I've been using the product to type up my notes during class, and it is perfect!For my first few years, I had been carrying my macbook pro around for class.This was fine when I literally lived in the school. For the last two years, I had to move into an apartment with a 15 minute walk to the school building.Carrying a 15 inch laptop, though much smaller than the competition, was still quite heavy with all my books. I turned to the ipad to be both my computer and etextbook reader. The only problem I had was with using my ipad to type in class. The keyboard was not good for fast typing.However, with the IMP38B, I have the best of both worlds in a small package!The keys are a comfortable familiar size, needing no getting used to time.The case and keyboard also have a matte finish. While minute, it is perfect for oily finger days.The only thing I don't like, is if I touch the swivel mount, or bump the ipad/keyboard to hard, the swivel mount does move a bit, requiring some readjusting.For the price, this keybaord is PERFECT and WELL worth the money!

B005HMO6A6,adjustable,What should be done with the stands?,"This is my review for the New Trent Airbender 1.0 (NT38B).  I received this product and right off the bat I liked the packaging and the helpful instructions inside.  After having a chance to use It I was blown away.  It has sturdy construction and the battery life on the keyboard is very nice.  Not to mention rechargeable.  In other products you would have to lug around a keyboard and a case if you wanted something to protect your device and be able to be productive.  With this case it is all in one.  I liked the adjustability of the orientations that the pad could be put in it helps when doing different tasks.  I also liked the adjustability because there are sometimes depending on light and other factors when you need the Ipad to be at a certain angle.I have in the past had a case that did well with protecting it, and had a stand but it was two pieces and the stand was not very adjustable.  I would have to use other small items to prop the screen up further.I also believe this case provides decent protection to my device, although I am not sure I would want to drop it in this case as I think the case would not fully protect it.  But for every day usage I believe that it would hold up.I like the look and feel of the keyboard the layout is nice and they keys are great to type with.  I do not do a lot of writing on my pad but with some of the new apps coming out for the pad I just may start on my memoirs.  Syncing the pad to the keyboard was quick and easy and worked right out of the box with no charging required.  The response of the keys are very fast and I do not even notice the time it take over Bluetooth.New Trent also took care to make sure all of the proper ports were left unobstructed. I even find that most aftermarket cables for the ipad function with this case on.  The one thing I would like to see, and I am not sure if it is even possible would be a all in one usb cord.  One that could connect to a apple charger and into a single usb port instead of having to find two separate ports to use for charging and using the pad.  I do admit that this would be a rare thing but I think it would put this product over the top.I think this product would be great for business men and women, a suitable replacement for a cumbersome laptop or when you just need something small for traveling.  It is a little hard to fit most modern day laptops on a seatback not to mention they are very heavy.  With this product you get a mini laptop just for the cost of your already purchased ipad and less than $40.00.I have enjoyed all the New Trent products to date and I can not wait to see what the good people in this company come up with next.

B006OBGEHW,great,How is the leather?,"The MoKo Slim-Fit Genuine LeatherA Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7Before I give my reasons why, let me note this case comes with no instructions, like so many products. Some folks have been confused just putting their Nexus 7 into this case (even breaking things!)So let's clarify that:The Front CoverThe outside of the front cover has the Nexus logo. The inside of the front cover has a strap 1 inch wide for your hand, two deep grooves, and a thin elastic black strap.The Back CoverThe outside of the back cover has a shallow fold-line. While the back cover is delivered flat, it is designed to be folded, well,  at the fold-line! (Don't bend the front cover!) But do go ahead and fold the Back Cover back at the fold-line. This fold turns the back cover into a support when you use the Nexus 7 in this case in the horizontal Landscape orientation.The inside of the back cover has six padded fingers. Two of those fingers are off by themselves. The other Four are clustered together. You (a) slightly fold the back cover, (b) then slide your Nexus 7 into those four fingers - exactly like sliding a drawer back into furniture. When all the way into the four fingers and stopped at two corners, (c) you flatten the back cover and (d) move last two corner fingers gently (one by one) over the corners of the tablet. You're done!For helpful video reviews search U-Tube. (That may require Flash which the Nexus 7 does not come with, but you can try the Firefox browser which does support Flash on your Nx7.)You can close the case and the magnet in the front cover will put your tablet to sleep. Open the case, the tablet wakes up. With the front cover swung all the way back around to lie against the back, you can put your left hand into the strap for a more secure grip on the tablet in its case. Video reviews show how the thin elastic black band can be routed to hold things snug and leave the screen clear.With the case open, if you just un-clip only those last two fingers you finished up with, by folding the back cover again you can swing the bottom long side of the tablet into one of the deep grooves inside the front cover. The case will then hold your Nexus 7 very nicely in Landscape orientation.Now - Why The MoKo Slim-Fit Is A Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7This case protects the critical corners when (not if) the tablet is dropped)A surprising number of cases do not. Landing on a side can distribute the shock, but landing on a corner can concentrate them into a disaster for the tablet, and ruin your whole day.This case reasonably protects the sides as well and top when the case is open.When the case is closed, your tablet is really quite secure.The price is modest - this case costs as little as 7.6% the price of your tablet!(I chose the genuine leather version so that comes to a 12% insurance premium, but I love leather.)The workmanship - at these prices - is very good.Given the pain and anguish I'd feel if I accidentally smashed my tablet, I will happily order another identical MoKo Slim-Fit case whenever this one shows significant wear -- just renewing my tablet's insurance.I've had this case for over a month, used it all day, every day, and it is still as good as new.My only quibble is I wish these same good people made a similar case for my new Nexus 4 smart-phone...  and maybe one for people so you could protect them, enjoy them in portrait or landscape mode, but that's just being whimsical.

B0074BW614,more,Is a problem common?,"I've used an e-reader since the Rocket ebook in 1999, and I've always believed I wanted only an ebook reader with no other features. I don't get out much, so my computer is convenient for everything else.I've had several Kindles and was happy with all of them, but I had recently played around with my brother's tablet. When my last Kindle died, I decided to replace it with the Kindle Fire. I chose the smaller one because I was concerned about my arthritic hands holding a larger device for long periods. The 7"" is just perfect for me. It's light enough that I can hold it to read, but the larger screen compared to the Kindle makes for easier reading. I love the color, something I never thought would make a difference to me.Oddly enough, high on my favorite list is the ability to review a book as soon as I reach the end. I have written reviews of every book I read on a readers social media site, but I have seldom put in the extra effort to come to Amazon to write a review. On the Kindle Fire, as soon as I come to the end of a book, a review page pops up so I can review it while it's fresh on my mind, and I'm reviewing everything I read.I didn't realize when I placed my order that I was ordering that the device had special offers. I've always thought I would not want to be subject to advertising when I was reading. However, I discovered that the special offers are discreet and no distraction at all. I've even found myself going to the special offers page a time or two to see what's on offer.The only negative is that the battery doesn't last very long. However, with the PowerFast charger, it doesn't take long to charge the battery.I think folks like me who have always used a dedicated ereader and never even used a touch screen will be pleasantly surprised with the Kindle Fire, and people who are used to smartphones and tablets will find everything they expect in a device.Update 11/8/13: I still think the Kindle Fire is a fantastic product, and I use it occasionally for games. However, I have gone back to my Kindle Keyboard for reading novels. The arthritis in my shoulders, elbows, and hands has  worsened since I've been using the Kindle Fire, and even using the device for a short while increases the pain significantly.

B005KOZNBW,great,What is the quality of support?,"First off this is a great little gadget. I bought the Roku 2XS and heavily considered the Apple TV before this one (I have an Iphone and Ipad). I ended up returning the Roku, not ordering the Apple TV and keeping this one. Why? Please read along.FYI, you can jump right into the PROS and CONS if you don't want to see my rationale and comparison of WD to Roku and AppleTVMy decision on buying and keeping the WD was heavily influenced by its claim (and now after trying it for a month, I declare it ""truth"") that it plays any format of video you throw at it. It does. AVI, MKV, MP4, MPEG, anything. You throw it in, it plays to perfection. On comparison, AppleTV barely plays anything non-Apple supported and the Roku was miserable in playing video formats. Other than every other MKV it played NOTHING. Deal breaker.If your main or primary goal is streaming I would suggest the Roku over the WD. Especially if you have Amazon Prime (not supported by WD). It is sleeker, has a much more elegant remote and a smaller box.Coming back the WD: The main function, streaming, works flawlessly in HD setting (at my internet speed of 20MBPs download, 3MBPS upload). Navigation menu is easy to navigate and is well laid out. Not as good as Roku,I might add.Overall it is good but not great and a quick recap as to why is below in the PROS and CONSPROS+ Plays ANYTHING you throw at it via USB+ HD playback is excellent+ You can skip to ""desired time"" as opposed to going with the 2X to 16X forward speed. Sounds trivial but is very helpful when tried+ Has a free remote APP you can download from the APP store (don't know about Android)CONS- No Amazon Prime (I don't get this. Understand AppleTV not offering it but why WD, why?)- Terrible remote like the 1980's VHS player remotes) . You need to push the keys really harr and have close to perfect line of sight to the box- Netflix app asks you to confirm your account every other day. Annoying. Needs an update to fix this.Finally, which player is better fit for who:- WD : If you have multiple formats of videos to watch on your TV and use Netflix, hulu, hulu+ or vudu (plus pandora and a few other music stations) this is for you- Roku : If you want to watch all the mainstream streaming services and Amazon Prime and not care for USB video playback of various video formats, this is for you- AppleTV: If you want to remain in the Apple universe, have an extremely slick gadget (and remote), have the ability to mirror your IPAD or IPhone on your HDTV, and you don't care for Amazon Prime then this is for youOverall, I am very happy with my purchase despite it comes with a remote, that at first look wants you wonder what the heck they were thinking.

B0097BEF1S,solid,How is the device?,"This is mainly a review for previous fourth generation usersApple iPod touch 32 GB White (4th Generation) CURRENT MODELupgrading to the Fifth Generation iPod touchApple iPod touch 32GB White (5th Generation) NEWEST MODEL.Background: I bought my first iOS device in December 2011 (4th Gen. 32GB iPod touch - White). It was everything I wanted and needed. Anyways, I had watched the keynote in September 2012, thinking ""No matter what, I'm keeping my old iPod touch"". By the end of the presentation, I was drooling over the new one. So, I sold my 4th gen. and bought this one in December 2012. Best choice ever.Upgrades over Fourth Generation:Build: It is so sleek compared to the 4th gen. I love the feel, and the ""squarer"" sides make it easier to hold and press the volume and power buttons. It is slightly harder to rest in my hand (my pinky acts as the support), but I attribute that to not having a case. It will wobble the tiniest bit, but having the loop button pushed out when flat helps to stabilize it. Also, the loop strap gives me more control when using one hand (and that is still easy, if not better with my longer fingers).-----------------------------------Screen: The screen size on the 5th gen. is a huge difference from previous generations. A family member still has the 4th, and it amazes me how stocky it looks now. The new length is great, as I do not have to scroll as often, and I can see more of the screen when I am using both hands (and I have small hands). It is definitely more responsive, and no glitches like a previous reviewer stated. The home button is more responsive as well, so I have to learn not to press it so much. The colors are more true to life now, and the screen is not blue or yellow tinted, just normal. The black bars for non-iPod touch 5 (worded as iPhone 5 in the App Store) optimized apps remind me just how small the previous screen was. Most well-known apps are optimized.-----------------------------------Sound: The speaker is slightly louder than the 4th gen. I can officially retire my cereal bowls. However, I have found that having the speaker on the right is a bit of a disadvantage, because I tend to cover it in landscape (right-handed). No biggie. The new EarPods are amazing. They fit much better in my ears, so I can sleep without taking them out. The bass is greatly improved. I never knewRock With You (Single Version)had background bass!-----------------------------------Durability: The anodized aluminum is sturdier than the previous metal back of the 4th gen. The top corner of my iPod just ""slapped"" the side of a tile counter today, and I was very pleased to not find one nick, scratch, or dent. I have yet to see any scratches (I have the White/Silver), and the back is finger-print resistant for the most part. I managed to get some sticky candy cane residue on the screen and sides last week, but I was able to wipe it off with a cloth. Oh, and the loop is sturdy. I have not yet bought a case because of this, as it is super easy to slip on, and it actually helps me steady the iPod in my hand. I'll probably buy some more loops instead of a case. I hated ruining my 4th gen.'s look with a case, even if it was clear. The iPod can hang by the loop and not fall off, which is good in case I lose my grip. The loop is hard to pull off without loosening it (unlike a Wii Remote strap), and has soft fabric where it meets your arm, so I can tighten it without a loss of circulation.-----------------------------------Speed: So, I had to do a few speed tests with a spare 4th generation. The 5th gen. boots in about ten seconds from reset, the 4th gen. takes 20-30 seconds. I opened the App Store in 6 seconds on the 5th gen., while the 4th gen. took 9 seconds. The Camera app launched in 2 and 3 seconds, so hardly any difference there. Overall, the 5th gen. decreases wait time. I don't find myself tapping my fingers like I'm using a Windows PC. It's a click, then a 5 second wait for games, and a 1 second wait for other apps. Safari is also faster, and connects quickly. I find myself with hardly any startup time, which my 4th gen. could take 5-10 seconds. By the way, my iPod touch has YET to crash at all, not even on Safari (which was a leading crasher on my 4th gen.). Graphic-intensive games no longer freeze, and my iPod only warms slightly (the 4th gen. felt like fire).-----------------------------------Camera: This will be short. It's better, period. You get LED flash (Which is an outstanding flashlight with iHandy's app), HDR for enhancement, and less noise. The 4th gen. catches NOTHING at night, while I was able to take a VERY CLEAR semi-family photo with flash in a pitch black room. The video is smoother, and clearer, and the LED flashlight can be used in conjunction with the video camera. Great for nighttime missions.-----------------------------------Battery life: Please do not pay attention to the lemon reviews. I have great battery life. With no WiFi, I was able to get a whopping ten hours of video, photos, games, and etc. Now, my 4th gen. would have died three times over. The calibration of the battery stays accurate. My 4th gen. showed 40-50% after thirty minutes of gaming. The 5th gen. still showed 65-75%. Awesome in my book, as I like to game without being plugged up. These numbers are with Wifi connected. On weekdays, I get a full day (9 a.m.-10 p.m. | Safari, Stock apps, Plaintext) without needing to charge. Weekends are about five hours (Gaming, communication, videos).-----------------------------------Siri and Dictation: Once she learns your voice, Siri can take you far. She didn't really have problems with my accent (I have a moderate Southern accent, and people said Siri couldn't understand them), so the user feedback must be working. She did have problems with drop (thinking it was job), and check (thinking it was Chad), but those are probably the fault of my own tongue. Dictation actually seems to work better than Siri, and it is better than writing long texts (I'm very thorough). I also enjoy the decrease of ""manual labor"". Reminders, FaceTime calls, Messages, Searches, even opening apps are handled through Siri. I never thought the days of a handheld robot would come. ;)-----------------------------------Overall: This was a must-do upgrade for me. I was cross that my 4th gen. was already a year old, and after seeing iOS 6 on it, I knew it would have a slim chance of making it to iOS 7. So, I decided to get onto the 5th's cycle. That was the best choice for me. I was very glad to see so many improvements, and each one is worth it. If you have a lemon, please return and exchange it. Don't give up on this great device.=========================================================================================================Six Month Update (June 24th, 2013):-----------------------------------Speed: My fifth generation is still running as fast as ever, and does not show any signs of slowing down. There is hardly any boot time for apps, and even graphic-heavy apps play smoothly.Screen: The four-inch screen is just so much better for my fingers. I never accidentally press the top of the iPod when I wanted to touch the back button on apps. The screen is nice and bright, and I love the true-to-life colors. I only use a dry fabric (microfiber cloth, shirt, pillow, recliner arm) to wipe the screen. Never use water, or you'll rub off the oleophobic coating and the oils from your skin, which makes the screen easier to swipe and scroll. Also, the screen is very durable, so I can use my nails (they are very firm) to scrap off sticky whatnot, and not worry about leaving a scratch.Siri: After a few months hiatus, I decided to use Siri again. After taking off some contacts' information, I feel safe enough to use the service, and it works splendidly. I'm glad that I don't need to give her my info just to use it, as that's not my preference. I use her to text others when I'm busy and don't want to stop. Timers and reminders are good to use with her, because I have a million of them. Those are such a *pain* to make. . .Sturdiness: Keeping with the s-themed update, I have to talk about this iPod's sturdiness. Just good craftsmanship on Apple's part, seriously. In six months, I only have a side dent and a nick. The back is still nice and smooth, and I would rest it on any surface without a second thought. The loop is history (RIP), and this device is slippery without it. I bought a Belkin case a few months ago, and there has been no more damage to my device, so I'm happy all around.

It is also a stylish case that will not be out of place in your hip neighborhood coffee shop.One of the first things you notice about this case is that it&#8217;s pretty heavy, although not as heavy as the original version of Airbender. The case has been obviously redesigned, and it has lost some of its bulk. The new case doesn&#8217;t come with the several layers of protection for the iPad, which made it fairly hard to put your iPad in and out.The case is indeed very sturdy and it covers your iPad Air almost completely, except for the screen, which is now completely exposed. It imbues one with a confidence that the case will protect your iPad Air from most falls and bumps, although I have not been brave enough to venture an actual physical test. The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are exposed and are easily accessible with cords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Air very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use. The keyboard is charged through a micro USB slot on the side. (An Apple compatible charging port might have been a more appropriate choice, but knowing how reluctant Apple is to let the third-party vendors use its ports, this was likely not going to happen.) The keyboard is very responsive, and I for the most part like the key action. However, this sized keyboard is cramped, and it will really vary from one individual to the next how comfortable you find typing on a keyboard of this size. I am fine with composing emails and typing documents that are up to 500 words in length (such as this one), but I would not consider writing the next great American novel on it.The arm that attaches the case to the keyboard allows for your iPad to rotate through an arbitrary angle. The design of the arm and its attachment mechanism has also been tweaked from the previous model, and it&#8217;s now much easier to adjust it and keep the iPad fixed in its place. Both the landscape and the portrait modes are fully supported. The arm is detachable, and it allows you to position the keyboard at some distance from the iPad while typing &#8211; very convenient for the times when you don&#8217;t want to stare too closely at the small screen. When attached the are is very securely fixed and it allows you for the &#8220;true&#8221; laptop use anywhere where you feel like taking your iPad Air.The case/keyboard combo is very well made. It is also competitively priced, and if you are looking for a rugged device/accessory of this kind then you will not go wrong with this New Trent model. I highly recommend it.

B003ELYQGG,not bad,How is the sound quality of this one?,"I decided to buy these despite the negative reviews, and I'm glad I did. They may not be the cadillac of in-ear earbuds, but they are well worth the $6 total cost. When I first stuck them in my ears, the words from the negative reviews rang true, but when I changed the shields to the larger size, it was a whole new experience. I bought them for a long road trip with 3 grandkids (one a 10 month old baby). The noise isolating quality was better than I expected based on the reviews, and the sound quality was totally acceptable. ANSWERNOTFOUND",and the sound quality was totally acceptable,"(485, 529)"
B0096YOQRY,not good,How did you like the image quality?,"We were looking for a second TV, for the family room / play room.  I selected this model based on the Amazon reviews, then bounced over to Conzumer Reportz and found that it was one of the top rated models in this size.  Based on my first week's use, I have to agree with both the Amazon and CR reviewers.  The TV is super light weight, and therefore a breeze to mount on a wall (it also comes with a plastic ""foot"" that lets you set it on a cabinet or table if you want).  Setup was very simple -- it connected to my router through the built-in WiFi connection, and registering the TV to my online media accounts (e.g., Amazon Prime for TV/movies) took a matter of seconds.  The picture quality is very good -- better than I expected for this price.  The sound is OK -- good for a second TV, but if I planned to watch a lot of movies on this set I'd probably hook it up to better speakers.  The web content apps (Amazon Prime, YouTube, Netflix, etc.) work well and easily, but the load times are significantly slower than on my PC, and typing on the on-screen soft keyboard is slow.  The TV does not have a general purpose browser, so you're limited to the apps Vizio supports.  The Sony Blu-ray player I hooked up the Vizio TV has a browser, so the lack of a browser in the TV set itself wasn't a big deal for me, but I wish it were clearer in the product description (references to Internet and WiFi led me to assume I could get onto the Internet from the TV).Bottom line:  A very good quality picture, OK sound, with built-in wifi and easy-to-use apps, all for around two fifty make this an exceptional value.  An excellent choice in this size class. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The picture quality is very good,"(676, 708)"

B0074WDDN8,manual,Is this lens have manual focus?,"A little bit of history:I started my foray into DSLRs with theOlympus Evolt E510, simply because I used an OM-10 for years before that. Being new to the DSLR game, the ""philosophy"" of 4/3s seemed very sound to me; high quality lenses that are compact and can be coupled with compact bodies that will put out excellent image quality; of course the added benefit of in-body stabilisation seemed to just make a great sum of parts. I went through a range of 4/3s bodies including theOlympus Evolt E-3and while I was always pleased with the lenses, the image quality always left more to be desired. Also, once I switched to the E-3, the bulk of the system didn't make sense to me as it was pretty similar to full frame and yet lagged in image quality. After 2 years with 4/3s I finally moved on to theNikon D700and have been with it ever since.The caveat of full-frame is obviously the inherent size and weight of the system and I hated being ""the camera guy"" every time I was out with friends or even shooting casually and that's when I started dabbling with micro 4/3s. The initial iterations while exciting, still were slow and not great in terms of IQ, but the E-M5 changed it all. Over the years the system has matured and the E-M5 finally brings a good quality semi-pro body that is small, light, beautiful and most importantly excels in image quality. I use this camera with Panasonic lenses,Panasonic 12-35mm/F2.8,Panasonic 7-14mm f/4.0&Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 Leica Lensand this entire system fits neatly in a shoulder bag with 3 batteries.I've been shooting with this system for 3 months now and have found the image quality to be very similar to my D700. I still use my D700 for paid work because I'm used to it, but I don't see why the E-M5 wouldn't work for anyone that wants to use it professionally. Of course, the depth of field differences will always exist, but those are inherent characteristics of the systems and it's up to the user to make the best or worst of it.Overall, the E-M5 finally realises what 4/3s was supposed to be and I recommend this camera very highly for anyone that's either looking to enter into a camera system or wants to supplement a full frame system with something smaller and lighter. But of course, there are a few compromises, but none that should be detrimental to use. I also like the new stabilisation system which has allowed me to get tack sharp shots at up to 1s of exposure! Also, the weather sealed body makes a huge difference too.This camera is a definite winner. ANSWERNOTFOUND",high quality lenses that are compact and can be coupled with compact bodies that will put out excellent image quality,"(214, 331)"
B003ELYQGG,awesome,How is the price?,"Holy hell. How is this even possible? These headphones were like 6 bucks (the white ones are cheaper) and... they have great sound.

B00009R6WY,excellent,How would you rate the sharpness of the image with the lens?,"While this lens will allow you to shoot in very low light, the resulting images will be very soft.  It sharpens up nicely by f/4, but there are several zoom lenses (e.g. 24-105mm f/4L) that can match it at that aperture.  While quick, the auto focus is not very accurate.  I spent a lot of time dialing in the AF micro-adjustment on my camera (7D), and while I was able to improve the average case, the variance was just too large to yield an acceptable ""keeper"" rate. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the resulting images will be very soft .   It sharpens up nicely by f/4,"(59, 128)"
B001V9LPT4,not strong,How is it the bass?,"Ok folks, I normally don't write reviews but figured I'd help someone out who was in my shoes.  I'm a cross fit / weightlifter who listens to all music, but primarily hip-hop / R&B; during workouts, running, cycling, etc. I was in a debacle trying to determine whether to get these S4s or the Bose IE2 (StayHear tips).  I've heard reviews claiming that each one is better, so I initially bought the Klipsch, then decided to try the Bose.  Here's what I found:PROS:- Overall the sound is great, the highs are good, mids are decent, bass is just OK --- not impressive (which is why I give it 4 stars and not 5), I'd say the sound is better than the IE2s.- Noise-cancelling - when I put these in, I don't want to hear any other sounds (e.g., the gym, other people, noise, etc), I want to be submersed in my own world.  For this reason, these are way better than the Bose IE2's, which ARE NOT NOISE CANCELLING.  When I tried the IE2's, I couldn't concentrate on my workout as I still heard normal noises, chatting, weights dropping, the A/C, etc.  For this reason alone, I am selling my 5 day old IE2's for a loss.CONS:- Bass is not impressive, it's just decent.  My old Sony's had better bass.- Although it comes with 3 sizes, the silicone is just a bit awkward and doesn't fit in my ear securely, so i sometime have to adjust it while running or doing other activities. In this regard, the Bose StayHear tips would must betterHope this helps. ANSWERNOTFOUND","Ok folks , I normally do n't write reviews but","(0, 44)"

After my player broke, I ordered the ""newer"" version of this player, and it sucked. I had to exchange it, and the new one wouldn't work either! Also, the newer version likes to download album art without permission. Personally I don't care for the album art; it just takes up space.

B00DR0PDNE,straightforward,How was the setup like?,"It doesn't have the functionality that other streamers have in terms of the variety of supported application but for $35 + tax you get a nice compact device that can play netflix, Google Play (online movie rental/buy service, similar to iTunes), Google Chrome and youtube. The 'cast is also an open platform so they say the final word is far from being said here, and there's a lot more to come.There is no remote or some on screen interface. The device is controlled via mobile devices or pc/laptop using the chromecast mobile app. I have the app on my iphone and Nexus 7 (android). Integration with the devices is OK but can be improved in terms of interface however playback for Netflix and Google Play was flawless for me.Setup is super easy and simple. You basically don't need to type in almost any information other than naming you device (optional but useful if you have more than one). Just plug it in, and let the app on you phone/device set up itself. Note however that the chromcast turns off when not in use so you have to turn on your tv and switch to the chromecast to wake it up so you can set it up (say on another device).I hope this device will support other apps in the future, like Amazon for example. But for now I'm extremely happy for the price I paid. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Setup is super easy and simple,"(726, 756)"
B003HFCDLY,amazing,What does it tell us about the color?,"I've been using this monitor for months now and found it to work perfectly with no signs of any defects.  I use it for a wide range of applications including web browsing, word processing, video and photo editing, and gaming.  In every case the monitor has excellent contrast with accurate + bright color display.  The only downside to this monitor that I've found is when I get on my laptop or netbook I miss this big and beautiful display.  I wish I could shrink the monitor down, put it in my pocket, and bring it back to normal size wherever I go.I currently use an older lcd monitor along with this one for duel monitor setup but plan to purchase another one of these to replace the older lcd soon.

B0074BW614,crisp,What is your opinion about the video?,"Video quality is exceedingly poor. The picture quality is what they say it is, but the frame rate is very very very low. I get immediate headaches trying to watch a video. The same is true for reading. The backlit LCD is the worst reading experience I have ever had.I bought the device for the text to speech function removed from the regular kindles. But they killed it. It has a single female voice and the cadence is just weird. How am I suppose to get into sherlock holmes when Watson's voice is female?Moreover, the short cut or accessibility details should make the device easier to read... Well not if you have a child. I couldn't get through a single page without my 2-year son tapping the screen and skipping to the end of the book. This happened 30 times in a row regardless of what I did to guard the device. All my son needed to do was tap anywhere on the lower bar.If I had personal time I could read a book, you know with paper. I use the kindle because it can read to me while I play with my kids. Well the new kindle fire kills that experience. With the old school kindle the worst my son could do was stop playback. Than I could just push the space bar and restart it. Now he taps the screen nearly anywhere and I'm finished. Than I have to search and search and search to find my original position. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Video quality is exceedingly poor,"(0, 33)"

B004E10KFG,awesome,How is the sound?,"There are many times when I just want my background music to follow me to the patio, on the road, in the kitchen, at meetings -- even at the beach. We used to cart around jam boxes with mix tapes, but now our computers, smart phones, tablets and just about any internet connected device can access our online music library. The speakers on these devices are just horrible and sometimes, I don't want to have headphones on. I wanted a nice sounding small unit that would allow me to enjoy music anywhere from just about any device.The JAMBOX is small, easy to use, sounds very good for background music, is an excellent design and even runs on batteries.SIZE: this thing is very small, you can take it anywhere and tuck it away in a place where it almost disappears. All you get is music.DESIGN: These folks included a simple interface that uses only four buttons and voice feedback to tell you how to pair a device, charging status and much more. It comes with a manual, but honestly, you can set this up with no trouble out of the box. It is well constructed with a nice feel. It even looks good.BLUETOOTH CALLING: The bluetooth implementation works for sound and as a speakerphone. I was not purchasing this as a speakerphone but WOW, this things is great for conferencing as long as everyone is in front of it. Yes it has an integrated microphone. Rejection is very good, we could all clearly hear the caller and they could hear us as well.SOUND: The sound is actually very good for background music. You won't get big stereo sound field, excellent imaging, thumping bass or dance party volume levels -- but what you do get is actually quite impressive. The sound is balanced from top to bottom and is actually very natural. Acoustic music with vocals like James Taylor, Nora Jones or Shane Jackman are reproduced with excellent balance and clarity. Electronic pop music can lack the dynamics and extended bass, but the bass you do get is not boomy and sounds very natural. One more thing about the bass, it is actually amazing this little thing puts out as much bass as it does for the size. If you are worried the JAMBOX will not play loud, it will, just not THUMPING loud. Because of the smooth high end and good tonal response, you can listen to this thing for a long time with almost no fatigue.BLUETOOTH MUSIC: As most devices, the BlueTooth audio is not as good as if you use the 1/8 audio jack. If you want the best sound plug your phone or computer into this thing. It will amaze you. You may need to turn your headphone output down some so as not to overdrive the unit. It will get a little distorted. The BlueTooth sound is very good, just not as good as when using the plug. Jawbone does something very interesting with the BlueTooth audio. Some devices with BlueTooth audio can be overdriven with the audio output from the source and will distort in at the higher levels. I play guitar and some distortion is good, but not on prerecorded music. NO! The folks at JamBox know then and use something called compression to dynamically limit the amount of sound from your device to the JAMBOX when your BlueTooth level is to high. This compression can sound like 70's pop radio where all the dynamics form the music are taken out. if this bothers you, turn your device (phone/iPod/computer) BlueTooth volume down until the compression is eliminated then use the volume on the JAMBOX to adjust the sound. BUGE IMPROVEMENT.In summary, of the BT Speakers out, this one is the best value for me. Smaller than the Bose, sounds about as good, super easy to use and has MUCH better sound than the sub $100 solutions. If Steve Jobs were to design a BlueTooth portable music device, it would look like the JAMBOX. ANSWERNOTFOUND",nice sounding,"(434, 447)"

B005HMO6A6,sturdy,Is the design nice?,"Been looking for a keyboard for my ipad for a while and happened upon this. I've had good luck with New Trent's stuff so I thought I'd give it a shot. I really like the fact that it doubles as a case (hence the clamshell) when closed up. The Blutooth keyboard pairs in a snap and works great. Love the added function keys (home button, etc.) and found the size more than comfortable to type on. I've had this on my ipad for a while. I thought this would be one of those things I'd use solely for travel but the truth is this case/keyboard has stayed on my iPad since I bought it. The matte finish is nice and I love that it's not emblazoned with stupid logos.  Doesn't add a lot of weight and I really like the adjustability of the screen angle. Battery life is pretty terrific, too. One other nice thing - I like being able to 'detach' the iPad and set that up as a separate piece from the keyboard. There are some other nice touches - the rubber feet, the fact that you can change from portrait to landscape. Once you remove the iPad from the arm, the hard plastic case stays with it so conceivably you could just travel with that. It's not perfect - I realized carrying it in my bag that it is just a little heavier than I would like. And it would be nice if the hinge had a ratchet action. But overall this is a really nice set up, and I've had experience with a number of these types of keyboards. All in all, I'm really happy with it.

B00006B7DA,own,How was the power supply?,"EXPERIENCE: Hooking this hub up was super simple, I connected the power to the hub, connected the data cable, and then the many USB devices. Because this USB hub is self-powered, that means that each USB device is getting all the power it needs. Again, because this USB hub is self-powered, the computer does not need to be on to charge the USB devices! This hub supports both USB 1.1 (12Mbits/second) and USB 2.0 (480Mbits/second). Which is a good thing because, most USB devices now days require a 480Mbit connection, in order to get anything done in time.Because this hub is so small, the wires tend to want to yank it off of the desk. So I used my super man solution to everything electronics, double sided tape, YES! When the USB hub is all connected up, you will see green LED lights for the ports. It is a nice green glow that looks good, but not so bright to be annoying.CONCLUSION:  I like the color of the D-link hub, as it pretty much matches my SMC Baracade router. Having 7-ports in a USB hub is just an awesome thing, I love how fast the transfer rate is, and I love the green glowing port LED's. With it being self-powered, I no longer have to leave my computer on to charge a USB device. So far I have not had any problems with it, and I give this hub a 5 out of 5.

B001V9LPT4,perfect,How is the bass?,"Reading many of the reviews on here, they recommended to use these headphones for at the very least 24 hours straight before giving them good field use. Turns out, they're all correct.When I first bought the Image S4's at a local best buy, they sounded ""pretty"" good out of the box, but they also sounded pretty painful in certain frequency ranges -- in the treble most notably. ""S"" and ""ch"" sounds in lyrics would punch my ears in the face and make me wince. Songs had a certain shrilling tinny quality to it, that was definitely not comfortable. Well, I left the S4's on my desk plugged into my Zune HD overnight, playing music at random. About 18 hours later, I can already hear a massive appreciable difference in the sound quality. The treble has softened back to a beautiful balance with the mids, no more shrilling pain from lyrics, and the bass has solidly found its place without trying to overpower the whole track. At lower volumes, the bass, mids, and treble are easily audible and full -- which was not the case before, where the bass would drop out, and the treble would overpower the mids.My opinion on the S4's went from ""If things don't improve, I will return them,"" to ""FOUND A KEEPER HERE."" -- And that's only with about a three-quarters of a day worth of burn-in! Most people recommend at least two to three days worth of burn-in to get the truly wonderful sound these headphones are capable of producing. I'm interested to see just how much they'll get from here in the coming hours.Elsewhere, the S4's fit my ears superbly. The oval tips on the buds fit perfectly into my canals. I don't get any discomfort from the build of pressure as I push them in -- the design seems to allow excess air to escape very well. This also means that then I put them in, I've yet to hear the speaker ""crinkle."" The other nice part about the oval design is that if I pull the muscles around my ear to make my ear stretch upward, the seal on the buds are not lost, which always happened on my old Lenntek Sonix. I would have preferred to have seen a braided cord on these, and the buds made from milled aluminum billets to really add some durability value to these, but they're quality isn't lacking as-is. The cord feels a bit thin, (not weak, just thin,) but at least klipsch added some of the best stress-relief shielding I've seen on a pair of buds. You won't see your cable weaken and drop signal on these for a long, long time -- if ever.I've trusted Klipsch before to impress me with my choice of desktop / entertainment center speakers, so when it was time to get new headphones, I thought I would place trust on them again -- and sure enough I'm not disappointed.

B007JF85WE,many,How about function?,"This is a fine set of receiver, but I have my own issues with it. I have been using it for last 3 weeks and found it a little disappointing.1. It is too huge, too tall. I had to get a separate furniture just for this.2. The airplay disconnects very frequently.3. The YAOC is good, but cannot replace your own ears for calibration. I was never happy with the calibration done by YAOC4. No cables included5. I am just using the 7ch music setting, everything else sounds just odd6. The apps on android and iOS are just crap. Difficult to use and navigate. But they add useful functionality. The feature that I liked was, give the IP address of the receiver on any device and it opens control to access it, the apps are not required for that sense.7. Remote is clunky. The buttons are too small, non-ergonomic and hard.8. Does not play video from USB. And playing video files plays audio with lots of breaks.9. The on screen menu is badly designed.

B008ABOJKS,amazing,Why this feature affect the move?,"Update (10/1/12):I downgraded the firmware back to 164. Since I upgraded the firmware to 220, I have already rebooted the router about 4~5x, the internet connection suddenly stops. I don't know if it's just me, but I feel that the router is a bit warmer when I touch it using firmware 220. I don't have any temperature measuring device so I can't confirm that it's really warmer (I did not adjust the transmit power setting, fyi).Update (9/12/12):I updated the firmware to version 3.0.0.4.220, and the 2 previous problems I stated is still existing.. I don't mind it that much but I still hope Asus fixes it soon. Workaround for 1.) I connect my PC to 2.4Ghz. 2.) I use Splashtop from my iPhone to connect to my home PC from office.AiCloud looks promising, supposedly you could view/play your media files from your iphone/ipad and android devices within and outside your network. But I'm stuck with the loading page, after I put my login user and password. My iphone can't login. Can anyone confirm if the aicloud works?Update (8/30/12):So far have encountered 2 problems with the latest firmware (3.0.0.4.164)1. I'm using Nero Media Home 4 in my PC to share my media to my wireless TV, Bluray and PS3. When my PC is connected to 5Ghz, the tv, bluray and ps3 cannot connect to Nero. When I connect to 2.4Ghz, they can see Nero and play the media. This works fine with N66U.2. I have setup port forwarding for Remote Desktop Connection, so I can connect to my home PC from my office. It's not working. This again, is working fine with N66U.QOS is also a known problem, but I'm not using it for now. I believe it's just a firmware issue since both are working with N66U. I hope it gets fixed with the next firmware release.Original Review:I bought this to share my media files, from an external hard drive, to my 3d tv and wireless bluray in bedroom. So far I'm not disappointed. I also have N66U to compare with, I've read from other reviewers that this router gets hot, when I touch the top part, it is warm but not hot, which is the same with my N66U.This is suppose to have a greater coverage compare to N66, but to my experience, the coverage is the same, which is already awesome.Initial setup was very straightforward, easy, fast and CD-less. Below are the actual steps after opening the box:1. Connect LAN cable from modem, LAN cable going to PC, and power cable2. Open web browser. Router setup page automatically shows up. Click Next3. Type the User login and Password that you want. Click Next4. Type the SSID and key for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz (or you can click the checkbox: Copy 2.4Ghz settings to 5Ghz settings). Click Apply.After that, your wireless device should now be able to connect to your new router. I even used the same SSID and password from my previous router, and my devices connected automatically after the setup.These are my devices that connects to this router:- 3 laptops- 2 Iphones- Ipad- wireless tv- wireless bluray- PS3- wireless printerNo problem with connections, no disconnects, iphones when outside the apartment are still connected.PROS- Media Bridge mode. Applicable using 2 AC66U. This feature is not available to N66U- Dual band, 450Mbps+1300Mbps. I can't comment with the AC speeds, I don't have wireless AC clients for now.- HTTPS authentication when accessing admin page. If your using this for office/business use, this is plus.- AiCloud. Coming soon, the app is not yet available from the appstore/googleplay as of this review. (This is now available as of firmware version 3.0.0.4.220)- 2 USB ports. Supports external hard drives, printers or 3g/4g modems- 3TB external harddrive works (Manual says only up to 2TB is supported). Tested using Seagate expansion 3TB STBV3000100. My TVs won't even accept 3TB harddrives when connected directly to its usb ports.- DHCP Manual IP assignment (if you need static private IP on your device)- DLNA. Streams HD vids, pics and 3D vids to my LG tv and my LG bluray player, no lags, no disconnects. And this is even using wireless connection and not wired.- Awesome range. Before, I was using a cheap netgear, single band 2.4Ghz, included from my ISP. From the farthest point in my apartment, I get 2 bars of signal in windows 7 wireless network connection settings. With AC66U, I get full 5 bars using 2.4Ghz, and 4 bars on the 5Ghz band.- 3 Large external antennas- Download Master (if your into P2P downloading/uploading)- Option to vertically stand the router, or wall mount- User friendly setup- Impressive performance particularly on 5Ghz band- Stylish looks and superb quality- Ability to install 3rd party firmwaresCONS- Steep price (but worth it!)- Lack of USB 3.0 (not a big deal, since I don't get usb 2.0 speeds for file transfer using FTP or Samba, which I already know before purchasing this)- Manual is a bit helpful, but this router has tons of features and the manual only mentions the basic functionalities.If you got the money, and want a great performing router and stylish as well, I Highly Recommend Asus RT-AC66U. If you're about to buy N66U, just add $20~30 to your budget, and get this router, you won't regret. ANSWERNOTFOUND",downgraded back 164,"(19, 54)"
B009A5204K,spectacular,What is the sound quality?,"One may look at me strangely, friends may call it ""dorky"", others may mistake it for a hearing device, but now it is purely a part of me. Day 2 of purchasing this, I've already stopped feeling its weight on my neck. I find myself reaching out for the skip button or the volume button to control real life, sadly LG tone does not come equipped with those features. Maybe in the future.Anyway, this is pretty impressive. To my biggest surprise, the bass was better than any in-ear headphones I have purchased. (other than Beats Tour, but I felt like Beats was made purely for those that enjoy bass-heavy music) The sound quality is definitely not questionable.Above it all, Tone is extremely intuitive. It's extremely easy to use and the vibrating-notifications and SMS readings are just the cherry on top of the best guilty purchase ever.The only strange experience I have is when I have my phone/device connected in my pocket, and I put my hands in my pocket at the same time. The sound gets cut off erratically. I can tell that it's probably my hands blocking the device (like the grip of death for iphones several years ago) but all that is required is to transfer my phone into my purse.The preciseness of the range (33 feet) is quite creepy.

B003FVVMS0,nice,What is the appearance of the connector?,"I ordered this LFE cable with a splitter to add to my new SVS sub and move the existing sub into a corner. the connector was VERY tight but this is a plus and I do not have worries about it coming off easy and it ""clicks"" into place. I was using an audiophile grade cable before but switching between them there is no audible difference and the quality appears on par for a fraction of the price. The cable is thick, gold plated, has colour coding but doesn't have the price of most pro grade cables. I'm sure if tested properly they may find some small quibble why it isn't a true audiophile grade cable but for us mortals who cap the price of front speakers to $2000 or so these cables are a great deal for their quality, price and performance. Now I hope media bridge reads these reviews because now I want you guys to make a 35ft hdmi with Ethernet FLAT cable to run to my future projector install, I don't want to pay 5x what you guys may charge for some other companies cable that will not be any better.

B0002Y5WZM,great,What do you think about pocket?,"This bag is  perfect for my present needs, and even has room for another lens in the future.  In the  main compartment I have, assembled and ready to be used, the Canon T2i with  battery pack and 18-55 kit lens with lens hood.  I put the camera in its place holding the hand grip, which makes it easy to put the camera in the bag and pull it out.  Because the camera is fully assembled, all I need to do is turn it on and remove the lens cover and  it is ready for use.Also in the main compartment is the Canon 55-250 lens with lens hood attached.  The lens is positioned with the lens hood up.  The lens with hood is a fraction of an inch taller than the side of the  bag, but this does not  interfere with the closing of the bag or the use of the side pockets.  When the bag is closed, there is no way to tell that with the lens hood attached the 55-250 lens stands a little taller than the side of the main compartment.There is space left over in the main compartment for another lens, which because I have no other lens at present, I am using to hold a pair of glasses in a case.The 2 large, zippered storage compartments on the outside of the bag, plus the storage in the lid and on the front of the  bag, give me all the room that I need for SD cards, a reserve battery pack for the battery pack, cleaning supplies, a camera manual,Attached to the bottom of the bag are straps intended to attach a tripod to bottom of bag.  Initially I was put off by those straps and had scissors in hand to cut them off.

B00HPM1G8Q,removable,How is the keyboard?,"Edit 4/21/14. I finally caved and purchased a Fire HDX to use with this keyboard. Absolutely love it and the case. The case has openings for the on/off and volume buttons, as well as the camera lens. The Fire stays nicely propped on the pillow on my lap and the keyboard is very easy to use, with the added plus of less hands on the screen itself = less build up needing to be wiped off. Especially after buttered popcorn...That was something that I feared, having last year's model - nothing being marketed now fits my Fire. I was sure I studied the product page carefully prior to selecting it as a vine option, and I didn't see anywhere that said *Kindle HDs will not fit this case* (I do so appreciate those manufacturers who do that), so I decided to give this a go.OK, so bummer my Fire is too big to fit in the nifty little holder (pouts). But...the keyboard still works great, I just use it as a separate piece in my lap with the Fire on the other side. The keys are very easy to strike, as opposed to how hard I have to bang on the keys on the Acer laptop to make sure I don't miss letters and have to backtrack. That said, this doesn't quite replace the typing experience from a *real* keyboard and sitting at the desktop - but then I'm from the old school of proper typing on a proper typewriter (ya'll remember IBM Selectrics?). As nice as this keyboard is, you're just not going to get the speed you're used to and using the ASDF JKL; they used to teach in school - and definitely not trying to work the keyboard on your lap whilst trying to type with both hands like I was taught. Very handy for quick comments on FB or Goodreads, etc., I like it a lot more than the Fire virtual keyboard.As for setup and the too-brief instructions, I charged the keyboard but then felt completely lost on item #2 to turn on Bluetooth. Silly me, I didn't realize that was something I had to turn on on the Fire and not a switch on the keyboard that I couldn't find. Thank goodness for Google, which led me to a very helpful video that told me where to go to get that turned on. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the keyboard is very easy to use,"(258, 290)"
B0042X9LC4,available,How is camera?,"Very fast focus, better than my older D100. Quality of display image on the computer is a lot better than my Sony little digital camera even at the same resolution.One thing I really surprised and like, it has perspective control in the program. This is mighty important for architecture photography. You no longer need to buy a more expensive shift lens anymore for taking picture of buildings etc.Only slight complain. Camera of this quality should have a PC sync for studio and product photography use. I was a pro photographer before, this camera is perfect for pro use, I don't want to carry double the weigh, pay double the price for a real pro camera just hoping it will hold up when you drop them.

B00BGGDVOO,great,What a good selection for all their products?,"The Roku 3 is the latest device that I've added to my home in an effort to replace my cable box. No, the Roku 3 by itself cannot replace all the functions of a cable box but it is a great place to start. The device, about the size of a hockey puck, is truly impressive and functions better than more expensive alternatives.---------------SETUP:From start to finish setup is incredibly easy. I got my Roku up and running in less than 5-minutes. Included in the box are quick-start instructions, the power adapter, the remote (with batteries), and the Roku device. I used a small piece of sticky back Velcro to adhere my Roku to the back of my HDTV, although there are other alternatives sold here on Amazon such as the TotalMount Roku Mounting Kit. The Roku is light enough that even double sided tape would hold the device firmly in place. The only piece you need outside the box is a HDMI cable. The Roku 3 accepts both wired Ethernet and Wi-Fi. I chose the latter and I'm happy to say that Wi-Fi works perfectly. The main reason I avoided the Roku products before the R3 model was because I'd heard complaints of spotty Wi-Fi. This is not the case at all with the Roku 3. My wireless router is in my basement on the other side of my home and the R3 easily picks up a strong signal and delivers content consistently without interruption.Once the device is connected to your television and internet you'll need a computer or internet-enabled device to connect to Roku's website and register the device. This is accomplished via a simple pin-code that you'll type into the website. Once that's accomplished you can start adding channels in addition to those already loaded on the device. For folks who already subscribers to services like Netflix or Amazon VoD you can proceed to sign in or in Amazon's case enable the device by following the on-screen instructions.---------------USE:My wife has been making extensive use of the device as we recently welcomed our first child and she uses the device while at home to stream television shows and movies. The interface is incredibly smooth and very refined. No unnecessary navigation or sub-menus are present. Apps like Netflix, Amazon VoD, Vudu, Hulu, etc. are very responsive and easy to navigate. Comparing the Roku 3 to another device we recently purchased, the Western Digital Live TV Hub is a landslide victory for Roku. Other companies will have to play catch-up to Roku's little device as it's very impressive.--------------What I Love About the Roku 3:(+) The remote is fantastic and doesn't require line-of-sight with the R3 box to operate.(+) The remote has a built-in jack that supports headphones/earbuds. This is a great feature for anyone with kids or poor noise insulation in their home and lets you watch programs without disturbing anyone else.(+) The interface is customizable featuring everything from themes to app tiles that can be changed and adjusted. Best of all, the entire interface isn't slow or clumsy. Button presses on the remote immediately translate to a response on-screen.(+) Universal search. Looking for specific movie or TV show but not sure if it's available on Netflix or Amazon? Universal search allows you to search available channels for your content.(+) The small and inconspicuous design is perfect in our living room where we keep our electronics footprint as light as possible. The R3 is very easy to hide and slim enough to fit behind my wall-mounted HDTV.(+) The quality of the streaming content is consistently superior on the Roku 3 than on a similar device, the Western Digital TV Live Hub. I'm not sure if it comes down to the processor or exactly what. I even have my WDTV Live Hub using a wired Ethernet connection and it still displays an inferior resolution to the R3.(+) Has a built-in USB port for connecting external hard-drives with additional content. Also included is a SD-expansion slot for storing content and additional channels.(+) Andriod/iOS app support that allows you to channel surf, change the channel, or display content from your smart phone on your TV.---------------What I Don't Love about My Roku 3:(-) Does not support non-HDTVs. The inclusion of only HDMI output means that only a suitable HDTV will work with the Roku 3. This is probably less relevant today than it would have been a few years ago but still something to consider for non-HDTV owners. The R3 does not come with a HDMI cable.(-) Limited support for external files. For movies .mkv (h.264) and mp4 (h.264) are supported but nothing else. Supported music file formats include .aac  and .mp3. For photos it's only .jpg and .png.(-) No YouTube channel.---------------Overall:The Roku 3 is a fantastic little device that opens up a world of content at your fingertips. The device is inexpensive yet extremely well refined and polished in a way very few other products in this market have achieved. There are some slight limitations to the device but that shouldn't stop you from purchasing this product. Recommended.---------------UPDATE: 7/2/13: I've been using my Roku 3 for about 3 months and in that time the remote has lost its connection to the base unit twice. I've noticed that on both occasions the remote will suddenly stop responding to certain commands. For example all of the arrow keys and the 'OK' buttons will stop functioning but I can still use the 'back' button. The easiest solution I've found is to simply power off the base unit by unplugging the AC adapter, waiting a few seconds, and plugging the adapter back in. The R3 does come with a troubleshooting guide in the manual that covers pairing a remote with the base unit but it was unnecessary in my experience.

It's not ergnomic enough for my taste for daily all day use, although it would be a step up from a laptop keyboard if that were your only other choice.  However, for occasional use -- in my case on an HTPC (Mac Mini) -- it's great.  You just can't beat the solar powered aspect, assuming it holds up for years.The mini usb unifying receiver is cool, it truly is tiny enough to leave plugged into your laptop permanently - I had it on a MacBook Pro for a week or so before moving it to the Mac Mini HTPC.  Works great in windows too for the few times I used it in Win 7 in my bootcamp environment.The size of it and the keys are great, and having a full sized numeric keypad may not appeal to all but I find it very useful.I've got a logitech m515 ""couch mouse"" due to arrive tomorrow to use with this.If you're used to using the standard keyboards that come with keyboards (I'm an ergonomic keyboard snob admittedly - i.e. the Naturals) I think you'd be fine for daily use.For what it is, what it promises, and what it delivers, this is definitely a 5 star product.

Recently, I figured out that I had some older HDMI cables in my HDTV and I realized that maybe I should update the cables with some better product.I have typically thought that the manufacture of certain things relied on branding more than reality like with cables and I again went with Bluerigger.First off, for the money, these cables are superior.  The packaging is excellent with a nice wrapping and protection in a nice box (recycled material).  Second, once I tried cables, I was blown away by how much difference was made in the picture quality.  The build quality is excellent as well, with a quality feel to the wrapping and heads.

I use a laptop for work every day, and always like to have a mouse as I don't like the eraser-head or the touch-pad nearly as much as an external mouse.  However, carrying a mouse around can be annoying.The Nano makes it less so- this mouse is ergonomically designed for true comfort.  My hands are fairly small, but I have no trouble reaching the very conveniently-placed buttons to navigate forward or backward, up or down.My favorite feature is the one-click button that you can press which will take you straight to your favorite Internet search engine!  This is a great feature when you have a lot of documents open already and don't want to minimize and go back to the desktop for your internet link!The mouse comes with a convenient carrying case, two AAA batteries, an optional desktop adapter and a CD for installation.  It is easy to install and takes absolutely no effort or reading of the instruction manual to work.  I am not at the forefront of the technological revolution by any means, but I enjoy comfort, simplicity and convenience in electronic accessories.

B000093UDQ,great,Was the mini tripod great?,"I just received my Digital Concept TR-60N tripod. It is actually 57-inches tall instead of the 55 listed. I was very skeptical about buying this tripod for my Nikon D90 at first because I had read all the reviews and saw many people saying that it isn't suited to support a larger digital slr, but this is just not the case. I just went out and shot for 5 hours with this, my 18-105mm lens attached to my Nikon D90 and I got some nice shots with it. The main reason I needed a tripod in the first place is to be able to shot in bulb mode with my wireless remote and this tripod was just that and you can't beat the price. I would also recommend getting the AmazonBasics wireless remote, it works exactly the same as the Nikon brand one. I will also attach a photo I took with this tripod to let you see how well it works. The tripod does look quite cheap in construction, but it doesn't feel so cheap that it will break. I would totally recommend this tripod for a budgeted consumer needing a tripod for a digital slr.

B0043TV8QO,decent,How is the speaker?,"I got this Lapdesk to use while watching movies in bed with my 13&#34; Macbook Pro. The size is great, and the speakers are much better than I had expected for a $20 usb-powered devise. They are reasonably loud - at least twice as loud as the macbook speakers - and have decent sound quality, if only a little bass heavy. The padding on the underside makes resting the laptop on your lap a bit more comfortable, although I was hoping it to be a little softer. The pad feels like a towel that had been folded a couple times, which is nice, but I have used a similar product that had small foam pellets that more evenly distributed weight over your thighs and was a bit more comfortable over long periods.Although this product does everything it claims to do very well, in retrospect, I would rather have spent a bit more to get a product that included a fan for ventilation. This product has no mechanism or design feature that dissipates heat, which is the only flaw I could find (although admittedly, it is not something the product claims to do.)4 out of 5 for a great product, especially for the price, although there are certainly some features to be desired.

B0043T7FXE,close,What do you think about each button?,"I'm a huge fan of gaming in general. Doesn't matter if it's PC or console, it's something I enjoy. The one thing I never really felt at home with, however, were mice. Unfortunately, I could never find a mouse that really felt 'right', or didn't hurt my hand after prolonged use. The mousing 'motion' is just not something that, well, meshes with me. I've been through dozens of Logitech and Razer mice, and eventually gave up. I knew what I wanted - Thumb control, like playing with a controller. I eventually found myself looking into a trackball, and settled on the old ""red ball"" trackman wheel.The Trackman Wheel, unfortunately, had a few issues. I didn't mind that it was wired. I did, however, find myself frustrated with the lack of forward and back buttons. Second of all, the optical DPI was just way too low for precise aiming in FPS games. If I remember correctly someone rated it at 400dpi, which is just unacceptable. A solid trackball, but these two little errors sent me slinking back to my trusty Razer Lachesis.I actually wrote Logitech an email describing a ""gaming trackball"" with laser tracking. I highly doubt they ever read my email, but they actually released the exact product I wished for, so I jumped right on it!Unfortunately, I have yet to get an invite to the Vine program, so I actually had to dish out the 49.99 myself. I don't regret it!First of all, the wireless technology in this trackball is certainly up to date. Latency is not an issue at all, and having the option to be wireless is certainly a plus. I do wish it came with a detachable cable in case you didn't want to deal with the battery, but then again, the single AA battery this unit requires promises to last up to 18 months. If this is true then I cannot mark this product down. I've had it for two weeks now, and so far, so good. I am running Windows 7.The addition of back and forward buttons answers the plea that many people have been crying for ever since the old Microsoft Trackball Optical was discontinued: A fully featured thumb-controlled trackball that doesn't cost 400 dollars due to becoming a collectors item.To make things better, most people always agreed that the Trackman series had better ergonomics than the MS Trackball, however the lack of buttons was the big deal breaker. It seems that most companies focus on their palm/prominent fingered trackballs and totally ignore the thumb-based ones.The M570 is the answer to all these problems, well, and more.I was quite shocked and excited when I heard that it was using a laser sensor. I am unsure of the DPI since Logitech doesn't seem to release that information, but it's certainly much higher than the Trackman Wheel, which makes it a godsend. The accuracy is top notch, the glide of the ball is just right, and the buttons feel solid. Nevermind the comfort of the ball in general. There are no problems there. I really cannot find anything wrong with this ball.If I was going to add anything it would be the following: Actual published DPI rating, Additional buttons for on-the-fly DPI adjustment, and finally one of those awesome Hyperscroll wheels that Logitech has released on their gaming mice.It seems that Logitech is even downplaying the fact that this ball is laser-tracked. The question is: Why? I know I am not the only person who games with a trackball, and while many people have settled with Kensington's balls for the task, I have been waiting out for an appropriate thumb-controlled trackball. Perhaps the M570 is just a test before they release the true ""gaming grade"" trackball? Or will this be the final hurrah in the trackball world?As of writing this, the M570 is undoubtedly the best Trackball on the market, not only for gaming but also casual use. Despite the few features that could have been included, the addition of laser tracking and two control buttons make it tough to beat and fills a huge void in the market. One can only hope this device's success convinces Logitech to continue further with their trackball efforts. Until then, the M570 will be my ball of choice for headshots.

B004J3ZV62,fantastic,Do you know film a video?,"I got this camera a week ago and have been disappointed.  I decided on Canon because I had one years ago and really liked it.  The quality seems to have gone downhill. The best feature is the compact size.  I find the ""smart auto"" not to be so smart.  The images are usually over-exposed and at times out of focus.  It's as if the camera can't figure out what I want to photograph and instead picks some detail I'm not interested in.  The menus are not obvious and I have to keep running to the computer to read the manual, which is not very handy if I'm away from the computer.  I got this to replace an old HP digital camera that took great photos.  The image quality of the Canon is much worse.  I suspect that the HP had a much better quality lens.  The battery needs to be recharged after about 170 photos.  I haven't tried the video yet, but I suspect that will shorten the battery life even more.  I was used to taking 250-300 photos with my previous camera before changing the battery.  I read some reviews that said not to even bother with the smart auto mode and I think they are right.  I need to experiment with the ""P"" mode to see if I can get some decent photos with this camera.  I had considered getting a cheaper model of the Canon powershot camera but opted for this more expensive one because of the extra feature.  I think the extra money was not well spent since the Canon ELPH 300 performs about as well as a camera costing half as much.  To be fair, I've only had the camera a week and there is a steep learning curve.  If things improve over the next few weeks, I'll add an update and may give this camera a higher rating.  At this time I'm feeling disappointed.Addendum (6/5/11): I've now had several more days to play with the camera and after trying all kinds of settings the picture quality is not much better.  I finally made some videos, which looked nice, but the microphones picked up a lot of extraneous noise even indoors in a quiet room and introduced a kind of background hum into the audio.  If the quality of sound doesn't matter to you, the videos are quite nice.  I've decided to keep the camera because it's so compact and I plan to take it on trips.  The photos are passable but nothing spectacular.  The problems with focusing and overexposure have continued.  I think the lens is just not as good quality as in previous cameras I've owned, including an old Canon.  Maybe the fault lies in me since I'm not an expert on photography. A friend who is a serious photographer offered to go over the camera with me, so after we get together I'll have a better idea.Addendum (6/24/11):  I had this camera for over 3 weeks now and have taken hundreds of photos with it.  My original impression has not changed.  It takes decent photos in general.  The AUTO feature is useless and needs to be avoided outdoors because it totally over-exposes the photos.  It's kind of ludicrous that you can't use the AUTO feature outdoors on a point and shoot camera.  Indoors the AUTO function is acceptable.  The Programable mode does a better job, and it's all that I use now.  Generally I'm disappointed with the quality of the images and It think this has to do with the cheap lens this camera uses.  As I said previously, it is nowhere near the quality of previous Canon cameras I have owned.  The best feature is the small size of the camera, so I will be keeping it and using it on vacations because it is so portable. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the computer,"(565, 577)"
B0035FZJHQ,stunning,How good is the quality of the  sound?,"Whether you're new to the world of DSLRs, or are a seasoned photographer who wants to try your luck at video, the Canon Rebel T2i is perfect. I've had nothing but great experiences with it so far, and highly recommend to everyone.Other than the T2i, I own (and primarily shoot with) the Rebel XS (1000D), and also have extensive experience with the Canon 50D. While my XS still serves me very well, I wanted to get an SLR with video capabilities since the release of the T1i. After finally saving up enough for the T1i, I really lucked out that Canon announced the T2i, which has even better features! I am lucky enough to finally have it, and want to share my experiences, and how they compare to my expectations==================OVERALL IMPRESSIONSThe camera is very small and light. It is not weather-sealed or as durable as some of the more expensive SLRs, but it doesn't ""feel cheap"" in my opinion. It features a 3-inch LCD (compared to the Rebel XS's 2.5 inch screen), which also has a very high resolution. It looks lovely! Auto-focus is fast, and I've been very pleased with the quality of the pictures and videos I've taken so far.==================PROSIMAGE QUALITY: I feared that cramming so many megapixels onto this sensor, there would be a lot of image 'noise' (the megapixel myth). This thankfully hasn't been an issue, and I've been very pleased with the pictures taken with this camera! Aside from White Balance issues (see below, Cons), image quality is pretty good!VIDEO: Some people have disparagingly said that Video on DSLRs is just a gimmick. I disagree. Based on sample clips I'd seen on YouTube, I was excited about getting an HDSLR, and while videos are sometimes shaky if you don't have very steady hands, a tripod eliminates those concerns. Audio quality on the T1i was criticized by many, but the T2i has a microphone input jack, which allows you to connect a mic. I don't yet own one so can't comment on that feature, but will update this review if and when I save enough to try this feature out. Additionally, this offers improved recording options, including higher fps (frames per second) than the T1i, which technically offered ""true HD"" recording of 1080, but only at a choppy 20 fps.LOW-LIGHT PERFORMANCE: I am much more impressed than I expected. My Rebel XS could go up to ISO 1600, but would perform pretty poorly there. This not only can go up to a significantly higher ISO level, but performs much better. Less image noise means you have to waste less time editing your pics, and many more keepers!SDXC SUPPORT: Only own SDHC cards up until now, but it's great to know that this supports the next generation of flash storage, which means you'll in the future be able to hold many more pictures than currently available.CONSNOT A FULL-FRAME SLR: This is not a full-frame SLR like the Canon 5D Mark II, and the APS-C sized sensor results in a crop factor (1.6x), and doesn't necessarily provide the same image quality as the larger, full-frame sensor does. Still, at less than half the cost of the Mark II, I think this is a trade-off that's well worth it for most users.Crop factor means that this camera, like other Canon DSLRs that have the APS-C size image sensor, will not be true to the lens's designation. A 50mm lens will produce an image more in line with 50mm x 1.6, or 80mm on a full-frame. This not only makes a difference for those who want to do landscape photography (which usually benefits from wide-angle views), but for those with unsteady hands. The general logic is that to ensure a steady shot, you need to shoot at the reciprocal of your focal length. So for a 50mm focal length, you should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/50 second for a steady shot. Keeping the crop factor in mind, you really should be shooting at a speed faster than 1/80 a second.Crop factors are common for most digital SLRs, as full-frame sensors jack up the cost of production, which are then passed on to the consumer in the form of very expensive cameras. So it's not so much a shortcoming of the Rebel T2i, but just a note to keep in the back of your mind.DIFFERENT BATTERY: This is more of a hassle for those who owned spare batteries than for those whose first SLR would be the T2i, but Canon changed the battery. Again, not such a big deal, but might be a hassle for some who find out that their old batteries can't be used on this model.WHITE BALANCE: I found that the 'Auto' White-Balance setting was wildly inaccurate on my Rebel XS (often giving indoor shots a yellow tint unless I changed the WB to the 'Incandescent Light' mode), and I feel that the WB settings on this model still aren't as accurate as they should be. If you want truly accurate WB, you can use a gray card, or an alternative would be to simply try digitally editing the photos on your computer after shooting.NO ARTICULATING SCREEN: No articulating screen, but this is a rare feature in DSLR's in general, so it's not a shortcoming of the T2i. Since most of your shots will probably be composed using the viewfinder, not a big deal, although it would have been convenient! If you absolutely must have an articulating screen on an HDSLR, look into the Nikon D5000.===================A NOTE ABOUT THE KIT LENSThe lens that comes with this is the standard 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 that comes with the other Rebels. It's a very good all-around lens, but you more likely than not will want to at some point upgrade your lens for either (a) better image quality, or (b) better performance in low-light conditions.This lens is very good, but for pros or those who pay incredibly close attention to detail, the optical quality of Canon's higher-end lenses is superior than to the kit lens. For most users, I don't think image quality will be a huge issue.More likely, the aperture size will be the reason people want to upgrade their lens over time.  A lens with a wider aperture allows more light to reach the sensor in less time than a lens with a narrower aperture. That means you can employ a faster shutter speed, which allows you to snap the shot faster, reducing the likelihood of a blurry picture. Outdoors on a sunny day, this aperture range of this lens won't be a limiting factor; inside a poorly-lit gym, however, you'll notice some blurry shots (see below for a recommended alternative for low-light shooting).Still, this is a pretty good all-around lens that can result in some great shots!===================RECOMMENDED ACCESSORIES1. An external flash: This will come in very handy. With the built-in flash, your photos often come out harshly lit. Bouncing an external flash off the wall makes a huge difference in image quality. I personally use the Speedlite 580EX II, but there are cheaper alternatives that are very good. Some higher-end cameras (i.e. Canon 5D Mark II) don't even have a built-in flash, which goes to show something about how high-level photographers view the lighting provided by internal flashes.2. 50mm f/1.8 II lens - At around one hundred dollars, this lens is relatively cheap when compared to others on the market. Despite its low price, it offers great image quality. While it lacks IS (image stabilization) like some other Canon lenses (including the kit lens), with a wide aperture of f/1.8, enough light usually comes in to ensure a fast shutter speed, which in turn minimizes camera shake. Keep in mind that as a 'prime' lens, your feet will have to do the zooming in and out. This is not as convenient as an everyday walk-around lens like the 18-55 kit lens which gives a good zoom range, but is a great lens for portraits. Also would ideally be a good option for poorly-lit places where the aperture of the kit-lens isn't wide enough to ensure a steady shot.CONCLUSIONSFrom my list of 4 pros and 4 cons, you might wonder why I'm giving this product 5 stars?... It's because considering the great performance - and low price - of the T2i, the 'cons' I list really aren't that big of a deal. Just because some cameras offer the aforementioned features the T2i lacks, it doesn't mean the T2i isn't a solid performer.  On the contrary, I have been completely satisfied with this camera's image and video quality, performance, features, AND PRICE, and would recommend the T2i to anyone looking for an affordable way to capture memories!------------------EDIT 11/27/10I just wanted to update this review to say that after shooting with the T2i for nearly half a year, I'm still as impressed by this camera as when I first got it. I have a few comments to expand on my initial review:VIDEO  I have been using the video mode a lot more than I initially expected. While it doesn't offer continuous auto-focus and therefore might not replace a camcorder, once you get the hang of manually focusing this is not a big problem. I many times have found myself in situations where photos couldn't capture the moment as well as a video could, and the ability to record clips has been very convenient.A note on the video mode, however...while it's automatic exposure is fine for most situations, if you find your videos are grainy, it's best to manually control the exposure. I've seen that sometimes even in good lighting, the camera will keep the aperture small (to have a less shallow depth of field) and boost the ISO. You can get around that by manually adjusting exposure settings, but again, the automatic exposures are usually fine.As for audio with videos, I personally still have not purchased an external microphone, but for those who are serious about movie production Amazon sells a highly popular 'Rode VideoMic' for a reasonable price. I have looked up videos on YouTube which demonstrate the difference between the built-in mic and an external mic, and while it's  tempting, I'd rather spend my money on better lenses than audio accessories.CROP FACTOR  To clarify on my 'crop factor' point from above on a full-frame vs. a crop-sensor body, there is a useful video on Vimeo that illustrates what I'm talking about. If you Google '5D 7D crop factor Vimeo' it comes up as the first result. As you can see, a full frame camera offers a view truer to the lens designations. Again, full frame cameras are costlier to make and therefore more expensive to the consumer, so APS-C sensor cameras like the Rebel T2i, 60D, and 7D are very good values for the money. But if you are not on a tight budget and think you might one day want to upgrade to a full frame some day for the improved low-light performance, higher image quality, and wider field of view, maybe skip on a T2i and just aim for a 5D Mark II (I personally love my T2i, but am excited about some day having my 24-105 shoot wider than its current effective 38-168 range.). For most users, however, APS-C sensor cameras like the T2i should be great, and some might even find the crop factor useful for telephoto work.LENSES  After spending so much money on a camera body, many people have a difficult time justifying buying expensive lenses, and I understand that. After upgrading from the 18-55mm kit lens to the 24-105L lens, however, I can honestly say that the money is well worth it. Colors are more vivid and truer to real life than the [now noticeably] duller colors produced by the non-L lens, and I rarely use the kit lens now. Again, the 18-55 is very versatile and provides a great value, but if you can afford to upgrade your lens to Canon's L series, you won't regret it. Perhaps try before you buy, to see for yourself what I'm talking about.LOW LIGHT  While this camera offers a boost ISO mode (to 12800 from 6400), I don't use that since its results are too grainy for my liking. But for night shots without a tripod, I have found ISO 3200 and 6400 to be a real advantage over my previous Rebel XS which only went up to ISO 1600, and even then produced noisier images than the T2i at 1600. While this camera doesn't produce high ISO pictures as cleanly as a full frame 5DMk2 does, at a fraction of the price I am incredibly pleased with this camera.MEMORY CARD  Lastly, I wanted to recommend you do a lot of research into which SD card you want to use. Class 6 or higher is recommended, but look into reviews to see how the card actually performs. I used to use a Transcend Class 6 card since it's very affordable, and have had movies abruptly stop recording at inopportune times. I upgraded to a Transcend Class 10, and unfortunately continue to have that happen. Not all Class 10 cards necessarily write at the same speed, so look thoroughly into reviews if you plan on using video mode to ensure you get a reliable, high-speed card. The Transcend cards are a great value for the money, and have many times been fine, but you might want to consider more expensive alternatives for greater reliability.------------------EDIT 01/28/11I wanted to update this review to reflect the fact that the camera is still serving me well, and to recommend some additional accessories I have since paired my T2i with. I recently got theInduro AKB0 Tripod Kit (Black),Joby GP8-BHEN Gorillapod Focus with Ballhead X bundle,Dolica WT-1003 67-Inch Lightweight Monopod, andCanon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L II IS USM Telephoto Zoom Lens for Canon SLR Cameras, and highly recommend them.CAMERA SUPPORT  With the T2i you can pull off handheld shots in low light by cranking up the ISO, but even though the T2i shows relatively little noise, it does show more than some would like in their shots (especially at ISO 6400). Digital noise can be reduced in post-production, but it's much easier to shoot at a lower ISO in the first place, especially for night shots. After paying so much for a camera body and other accessories, buying an expensive tripod might be the last thing you'd want to do, and I understand that: for a while I was using an older, cheaper tripod that was designed more for light camcorders than SLRs with heavy lenses. While this set-up technically worked, I didn't feel very confident in its reliability. After doing a lot of research and asking many photographers, I got the Induro kit, and have been very happy with it so far. It is more expensive than I would have liked, but it doesn't make sense to skimp on support and risk damaging your gear! With tripods, you have to make trade-offs between price, sturdiness, and weight, and while I'm happy with my tripod, it might not be adequate for your needs. There are many websites with tips on what to look for in a tripod (i.e. ball head, pan-tilt head, etc) that can help you make an informed decision. The Gorillapod is not nearly as essential to your shooting as a dedicated tripod, but I recommend it if you find yourself in situations where you don't want to/might not be permitted to carry a tripod, but need support. It sets up much faster than a tripod which needs to have its legs extended and locked. Lastly, a monopod is a great way to stabilize your shots without the hassle of having to carry a tripod, and is even more portable than a Gorillapod. That being said, it doesn't provide as much stability, so I use it primarily to stabilize video shooting (which can be a bit shaky due to composition through LCD screen instead of viewfinder, especially with a telephoto lens).TELEPHOTO LENS  The T2i has a high resolution sensor that, in my experience, provides for great shots even after cropping. I have taken shots and cropped to 100% and been pleased with results, but sometimes you want extended reach without cropping, and here a good telephoto really shines. Canon and third-party lens manufacturers offer many great telephoto options for the T2i, and it's important to think of what you need a telephoto lens for before investing in one. If you'll primarily be shooting with a tripod, you probably don't need IS; if you're going to be shooting in adequate light, a wide aperture isn't essential. I used the Canon 70-300 non-L non-IS lens, but don't recommend it. Keeping in mind the reciprocity of focal length and shutter speed, Image Stabilization on a telephoto lens makes things much easier for hand-held shooting. I much preferred the 55-250 IS over my 70-300 non-IS (there are also IS versions of the 70-300), but found its low-light performance was weak due to its relatively small maximum aperture size. I recently got the 70-200 2.8 IS II, and am blown away by its fast auto-focus, great low-light performance, and superior optical quality. It is an expensive lens, but is well worth it if you need a fast lens (wide aperture) that features Image Stabilization.--------------------------EDIT 02/07/11 *FINAL UPDATE*NEW REBEL  The T2i's successor, the T3i has just been announced, and will be available in March. Based on its specs, I don't think this is a necessary upgrade for current T2i owners. The main improvements found in the T3i are a swiveling screen, wireless flash transmitter, improved Auto mode detection, an enhanced Movie Zoom mode, and creative filters. Of these, I think the most important or sought-after improvements are the flash transmitter (which is is great for advanced shooters and those who want to explore with lighting) and the swiveling LCD screen (which allows for more flexibility in shooting). While these are useful new features, they are largely incremental and I will be sticking with my T2i. For new buyers, the T3i looks great and is very worth looking into when it comes out. Canon also announced a T3 camera to succeed the Rebel XS, which is great for beginners but is lacking in features compared to the T2i and the newly-announced T3i, including the ability to capture 'true HD' at 1080. Even with Canon's recent announcements, I think the T2i is a great DSLR and I highly recommend it to everyone.----------------------------EDIT 06/13/11 *THIS REALLY IS THE FINAL UPDATE*I know this review is now longer than some novels, but I really can't stress enough how great this camera is. I've used this in a variety of settings, both professionally and for personal use, and it's served me so well throughout. While I've shot events before, last night I shot the Tony Awards in NYC...which meant many thousands of shots over the course of many hours...and I was highly impressed with the T2i's performance. I did have to change batteries during the course of the event, but that was many hours into the event. You can easily get a spare third-party battery for just a few bucks.I recently purchased a cheap (less than 20 dollars) intervalometer from Amazon, and have started creating time-lapse videos with my T2i. Setting up cool time-lapse, and capturing HD video, are two areas where an articulating screen (like that found on the T3i and 60D) would come in handy, but again, this is not an essential feature, so I am pleased with my T2i. The intervalometer I got through Amazon was third-party, but since it cost about a tenth of the official Canon one, I am very pleased and highly recommend it if you want to take your T2i to the next level.The T2i is an amazing camera. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who is even remotely interested, whether you never owned an SLR before, or want a second body as a backup. I love the T2i!

B0001FTVEK,better,Does this headphone look better?,"These wireless headphones are really awesome! The base unit comes with a phono plug to 3.5 mm headphone jack adapter, and then a 3.5 mm headphone jack to left/right RCA audio adapter. The base unit has nice, long RCA cables on it. They are not heavily shielded or anything, but they are on par with a good set of headphone wires.The wireless has worked awesome for me! No static or noise or any interference! I was worried that there might be a slight amount of static due to all of my computer and electronic devices planted only inches away from the Sennheiser base unit. I have not had a single issue at all! Amazing!The headphones have a on/off switch on the left ear cup. It also houses the 2 x AAA batteries (rechargeable ones that were included). The right ear cup has two dials. One for volume, and one to tune the headphones. The volume is fine, no problems. However, I find the ""tune"" dial to be a little archaic. The base unit itself has a toggle switch that lets you select between 3 channels. I have 3 units, all set to different channels, so I can tune into which ever one I want to at the time, and my brother and sister can too. I would have preferred a similar switch to have been present on the headphones, even though it is easy as pie to tune the signal in, and you have a good wide range where you get superb sound (unlike some tuning devices where you have that magical sweet-spot that is harder than a fruit-cake to get perfect so you don't have static). The headset itself is also a bit heavy, so if you plan on leaning forward with them on, be ready to keep them from sliding off your head. Not too bad, considering they have batteries and all.The price is not too bad! And, being made by Sennheiser, these headphones are great!

You can also daisy chain a second one (and possibly keep going?) for stereo -- however I just needed some sound from my VM platform, so this does just fine.  The buttons are difficult to press -- I have to actually pick it up every time or I'll push it off the desk when I attempt to control the volume.

B002LITT42,excellent,How is the image quality?,"I have to assume that the folks who have had problems with this camera either have not completely read the manual that comes with it or are too quick on the trigger for shooting (all digital cameras need a second to focus properly before fully depressing the button), or they received a lemon (which is why companies provide warranties) and they should have either return the camera to Amazon, as defective, for a replacement or to Canon for fixing.  I have found Canon Service to be Excellent over the years.  I have used them on a couple of occasions.  On one, the camera was well over a year out of warranty, the cost to me was going to be about $149 to fix.  After they received it, they wrote to me that this was a component that has been failing, and should not, and thus there would be no charge for the service.  Now, I can not ask for a more honest, customer oriented manufacturer than these folks.Now, it is true that because there is a ""popup"" flash, I needed to learn to hold the camera differently.  The way Canon suggested is Great as it gives me, and the camera, far more stability than the old way. I did use my left hand finger on top of the camera in a pincer hold with my other fingers.  Now, it is cradled in my left hand between my thumb and second finger with the first finger cradled along the side of the lens giving me far less shake.  By the way, this flash sure does light things up far better than my other cameras with the built in flash on the front!!!Thus far, the zoom shots have been awesome, everyone is raving about the quality of the pictures I have taken of them,, Low light shots are unbelievably clear as if I was using a flash and the day shots are great.

B004J3ZV62,poor,How is the image quality like?,"The Canon 300HS an excellent camera as long as you accept that it's not a ""baby S95."" If you want fast access to manual controls, this is not the camera for you. If you like scrutinizing the image pixel by pixel, this is not the camera for you. However, someone who's a non-photographer and wants good-looking photos from a small camera in ""Auto"" mode will almost definitely love it.Likes:--------------1) Image quality is good for a camera in this price range. Yes, there is some mild corner softness at 100% magnification, and there are some chromatic aberrations in high contrast areas, but looking at the whole photo at any reasonable magnification, I'd be hard pressed to criticize the quality. The noise is well controlled, and there is enough fine detail to avoid the dreaded ""water color painting"" effect of some other popular cameras. Auto white balance does a good job under a variety of lighting, exposure is generally spot-on, and low-light images are better than I expected. ISO 1600 is usable for small prints in low light.2) Video quality is very good. It uses a high bitrate compression, which eats memory fast, but I can see details in the video that other cameras simply smudge over. My only complaint is that the 1080p video is recorded at 24fps, and is somewhat choppy in motion. Switching to 720p or lower resolution results in 30fps video, which produces noticeably smoother motion. The stereo sound quality is decent, and the mics are plenty sensitive. When zooming during video recording, there is some motor buzz that's picked up by the mics, but it's only noticeable in a quiet environment.3) I like the 24mm wide angle lens, and prefer that over some 100x mega-zoom. It lends itself well to landscape shots, interior shots, close-ups, and other creative photography scenes.4) The camera is pretty quick to power on, and the controls have good response. It focuses in under 1 second, there is minimal shutter lag, and shot-to-shot times are about 2 seconds.5) The controls are intuitive, well-organized, and the buttons are plenty big for such a small camera. I had most functions figured out in a few minutes without having to resort to the manual. The mode switch provides a convenient thumb rest when holding the camera.6) Construction and build quality seems solid. I bought mine at a local store and made sure to get the version made in Japan. I haven't observed the problems mentioned by other reviews, like shaky video zoom or easily scratched finish. The battery door seems somewhat fragile, though.Dislikes:--------------1) When completely zoomed out, the lens casts a shadow from the flash in the lower right corner.2) Video mode is mostly automatic, you can't even adjust exposure compensation. I have older compact cameras which can do this, it would have been nice to have that feature here.3) The quick-set menu is somewhat slow to operate because it does not present as much information at once as other cameras, for example Panasonic's Q-menu. It's a vertical layout with vertical submenus, whereas a horizontal layout with vertical submenus would have been better.4) There is no wind-cut option for the microphones.I'm not taking points off because these are relatively minor issues, considering the camera is aimed at a novice user. It's not perfect by any means, and it's missing some toys found in other cameras, like a high resolution screen, auto HDR, or auto-stitching panorama. However, if your priority is the end result - the quality of images or video coming out of the camera - this one stands above the competition. I would recommend it to anyone looking to produce good-looking photos with minimal fuss. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Image quality is good,"(406, 427)"

B0096YOQRY,not good,How did you like the image quality?,"We were looking for a second TV, for the family room / play room.  I selected this model based on the Amazon reviews, then bounced over to Conzumer Reportz and found that it was one of the top rated models in this size.  Based on my first week's use, I have to agree with both the Amazon and CR reviewers.  The TV is super light weight, and therefore a breeze to mount on a wall (it also comes with a plastic ""foot"" that lets you set it on a cabinet or table if you want).  Setup was very simple -- it connected to my router through the built-in WiFi connection, and registering the TV to my online media accounts (e.g., Amazon Prime for TV/movies) took a matter of seconds.  The picture quality is very good -- better than I expected for this price.  The sound is OK -- good for a second TV, but if I planned to watch a lot of movies on this set I'd probably hook it up to better speakers.  The web content apps (Amazon Prime, YouTube, Netflix, etc.) work well and easily, but the load times are significantly slower than on my PC, and typing on the on-screen soft keyboard is slow.  The TV does not have a general purpose browser, so you're limited to the apps Vizio supports.  The Sony Blu-ray player I hooked up the Vizio TV has a browser, so the lack of a browser in the TV set itself wasn't a big deal for me, but I wish it were clearer in the product description (references to Internet and WiFi led me to assume I could get onto the Internet from the TV).Bottom line:  A very good quality picture, OK sound, with built-in wifi and easy-to-use apps, all for around two fifty make this an exceptional value.

B003VAM32E,poor,How long is the battery life?,"Logitech G700 ReviewPROS:- Good tracking / High Precision (5700dpi max, read further)- Nano Receiver- Good ergonomics: I personally like the G700's shape and feel. I don't think it's heavier than it needs to be for a solid, positive movement and I can use it for hours, even corded without strain.- The 13 buttons can be programmed for 5 different profiles - Using Setpoint 5.44.5 works like a charm. The tactile feel of them is fine for my needs. I would prefer less of clicking noises using left / right and center mouse buttons.- Finishing is great matte black - less cheesy than the G500 or other ""gaming mice"". Probably a Con for ppl that like showing off, but...- User replaceable AA rechargeable Eneloop battery.- You can charge it while you use it. The ""wired"" mode transition is seamless - at least with the drivers I've used -  but some reviewers disagree on that. Setpoint 5.44.5 on Win 7 64bit never produced a freeze or loss of settings while hot-plugging the USB cable while the mouse was used.- Matte finish easy to grip. Feels ""different"" than the normal rubber padded mice, but will probably last longer too. Grip is quite positive, no concerns.- Includes USB extension cable for wireless receiver - more of a desktop user easement. Range is great for laptop use, works out to 3 feet / 1 meter easily, never had need for more.CONS:- Big, not ideal for slipping it in your laptop's slim carrying messenger bag, but nothing terrible. &lt;- actually I do carry it around in my slim messenger belkin, but that's me...- Noisy clicks...I would prefer it more subtle for ""stealth"" gaming. Hard for someone to miss what you are doing with loud blazing clicks when in the heat of battle!- Charge only via powered USB port (well, I wouldn't like to drag a docking station around, so, no biggie)- Slightly elevated slope might be uncomfortable to some - definitely not a ""claw""-grip. Works Ok with my middle-sized hands.- Does not include a unifying nano-receiver (guess the ""G series"" nano provides faster response? nothing i can feel tho)- Battery life is nothing to talk home about, but not terrible, and you can replace it almost on the fly (or hook the USB cable). On par or better with most high performance mice, that are tied to Li-Ion proprietary battery packs.This review follows almost 3 weeks after the mouse has been purchased.Main thoughts -- Productivity PerformanceUsed the G700 in a variety of applications, mainly design programs and games. The 5 available profiles work a charm and you can program the driver to ""sense"" the application's .exe and switch profiles on the fly: switching between say - Autodesk Revit and SketchUp to Adobe Illustrator and back for copy-pasting etc, the software follows you switching profiles seamlessly, altering assigned macros for the thumb / side buttons. Each profile can have it's own DPI setting and DPI steps that you can then hard-set on the fly on the mouse. The profiles are stored on the mouse's internal mem-bank too, so you take those settings with you to use on multiple PCs.- Gaming PerformanceThe real performance difference is in games tho, where you really feel the increase in precision despite the dpi used - I doubt that people can positively utilize more than 2000dpi on their mice, with me finding a limit close to the 1600dpi. Above that you cannot be precise enough for anything but laid back internet browsing.I do play MMOs (EVE online), where the extra buttons can do macros etc just fine but precision is not that critical. In the more demanding FPS world, the mouse clearly shines. To be honest I've never had complains on the responsiveness of the VX Nano or the Microsoft's Mobile 4000, yet the G700 beats them on all surfaces. Almost any cheap cloth mouse-pad (used it on black and grey) did improve the feel of it over bare desktop surfaces.Tracking while you snipe is great, and sensitivity is easily adjusted by the default keys left of your right index finger. You can customize the dpi switching to be assigned to any key, with +/- steps in independent keys or looping through the settings with just one key.The ""extra"" G keys have a positive feel and I personally found them quite easy to find and identify just with touch. Unlike other reviewers, I did like the thumb keys and I can use them each and every time without missing or guessing. All of them work for both a slight ""upward/in"" movement of the thumb, or direct depression. Did not run into locking problems when using more than 2-3 buttons at a time (speaking on coms, using assigned macros and/or firing etc).Response is great and you cannot tell between wired and wireless.- Side status LEDs3 triangle LEDs live on the left side of the G700. With 3x primary colors, indicate the profile in use in case you manually switch(orange - 5 steps), DPI used (Red, 5 steps) and battery life (Green, 3 steps, with a single Red coming on when battery is really low).- More on the sensor's DPI ratingRemember tho that most ""common"" optical mice dance around the 800-1000 dpi range, and with today's screen real-estate (typical 1920x1080) and dual screen configs being  common, many times you need to move a 800dpi mouse along your mouse-pad and even lift/return it for some more to go from one edge to the other. The software allows you to set 5 dpi steps for each profile, and I have none going above 3200 dpi (nor did the factory settings).- BatteryThe mouse comes with a single Sanyo Eneloop battery, and typically lasts about 2 days of work/gaming. Keep in mind that I do use my computer at least 10 hours a day, so I am happy with that. Charging usually completes within 3-4 hours while in use. Never timed it tho. The ""low battery"" indicator does come up on your screen, but as other reviewers mentioned, it's too conservative and you do have at least a couple of hours - or more - of usage after the warning.Personally I would prefer 2x AA batteries in parallel (like with the M705 marathon) for better battery life. Also keep in mind that despite the fact that the Eneloop is one of the highest quality NiMH batteries out there, their rated capacity is 1900-2000mAh, while most high capacity AA NiMH are rated around 2500-2700mAh. I tend to believe that the Eneloops would shine on low-drain, long battery life applications, something the G700 is clearly not. I don't have a spare 2700mAh (I use them in my flash units), but I believe the G700 would be better paired with such cells.- Corded use and chargingAgain, the transition from wireless to wired mod was seamless in my experience and the latest drivers.The cord is not the softest around, but I never felt it ""stiff"" and uncomfortable as some reported. It's an ok cord. Not as soft as many silicon-skinned cords some mice used, but works fine for me.The USB wire connector utilizes a micro-USB male plug on the G700's end. That means that any such cable could work for both using and charging the mouse. For the latter, probably any 5V mobile phone charger would work  too, for those who desperately need an off-USB charging device (many PCs do power their USBs when in sleep mode, so charging is happening even when the machine is not ""on""). Micro USB is supposed to be the EU standard for cell phone charging since 2010 (Apple, Nokia, Samsung, LG, Motorola etc among others agreed on using it universally) so more and more devices will provide compatible chargers.- Why the G700? So many Mice out there!As I was mostly on the move, I do appreciate wireless mice, and I've been spoiled by the nano-receiver on my Logitech VX Nano for more than 2 years now. The thing is simply amazingly versatile and quite fool-proof (not in a few occasions people had damaged the  dongle, destroyed a USB port or both due to them protruding in the wrong place at a wrong time.Since I've bought the VX nano, I've used a couple of mice on friends computers and/or tried some on mine. I did not fail to notice that the old generation Laser ""848nm"" sensor they VX Nano and most of the nano-receiver mice Logitech produced the last few years (V220, M505, M705) did lack in tracking precision, even against relatively cheaper competitors like the Microsoft Mobile 4000 mouse - a unit that if it wasn't for the extremely jerky/cheap feel of its wheel/center button would be almost perfect for the &lt;$20 price many vendors sell it for.Since I liked the Hyper-Fast scroll wheel in my VX nano, but I've hated the fact that the center mouse button was not on the wheel, the main contenders for replacing it where all full scaleLogitech mice, which provided all of:* Hyper-scroll wheel + center mouse button with positive feel* Better tracking than the VX nano* Ideally wireless with nano-receiver.* At least 2-3 programmable buttons, but not as badly placed as on the VX Nano.* Not really expensive - I ended up buying on the high end of my budget but most competitive ""gaming"" mice offered less features for the same price.The G700 was chosen over:- The G500 - seemed a great mouse, but cheesy in appearance and not really cheaper in the long run especially since it's only wired.- The Performance MX. Relatively better battery life, but not that better (still a high precision sensor with only one AA battery), not cheaper, less buttons (that many will not use anyways), with a unified nano receiver. I believe it would be a great alternative if it was actually cheaper. Has the ""glass capable"" dark field technology, but I never planned on using it on glass.- G400/300 - only wired, cheap(er) feel, great tracking. Don't like the right side buttons on the G300.Anywhere Mouse MX: All the pros of the VX nano, and all the cons too, but the 2 side buttons placement. Nothing a VX nano owner will actually want, unless you have to use it on glass and/or really need a unified receiver to use with a keyboard or something.- M705 ""Marathon"" mouse: Did not promise better tracking, but would give great autonomy and a definitely better battery life. Unifying receiver, way better scroll wheel than the nano-mice - if you care for middle clicking...off center sensor etc where never annoyances for my game style.6 month Update:After 6 months with the G700, I have nothing more to say that it still feels a great buy. I use it daily for design/drafting and gaming. Battery life is mediocre, but will easily last 20 or so hours of use in my hands. The matte finishing still looks great, with only a hint of skin grease visible on the left button. G keys never missed a beat thus far. Wish it had a unifying receiver to be perfect (ended up getting a K series unified keyboard for my laptop and I get to use 2x USB ports just for input devices).9 month Update:Rock and solid in every department other than battery life. Tried an old GP 2700mAh and still the mouse needs to be plugged every other day the most - and I am not using it @ 1000 reports /sec for productivity tasks which is 90%+ of the hours it is used. Got used to it, but Logitech should definitely consider a 2x AA design for the next flagship mouse, even if they come up with reduced consumption components. ANSWERNOTFOUND",for hours,"(259, 268)"
B00009XVCZ,smooth,Is the focus ring smooth?,"I love this lens!  It's my favorite lens thus far and my primary lens for most occasions.

It was a little slow when I tried it but not much of a problem for me since I don't really use that feature.  Images in the focus point are crisp and everything else has nice smooth bokeh.

B002SZEOLG,available,Does the company has available driver?,"I don't yet have a Wireless N router (probably later this year), so I cannot test the Wireless N speeds obtained this adapter, so you will need to check other reviews for that one detail.In my bedroom, the wifi coverage from my router is weak and patchy - as received by the built-in wireless on my laptop - so I thought I would try using this adapter instead.The adapter comes with a USB extension, which I think is very helpful for troublesome locations, as you can experiment with different placements and escape ""dead zones"".It also includes a small CD with complete drivers.  For any other device, the drivers could be on the web... but... if you bought this adapter because your internal wireless adapter is dead, then you can't download the drivers, because you need this device to get on the Internet !  So, it is good that TP-LINK has considered that possibility.  Of course, it's also simpler to just insert the CD.  The only flaw in this system is that some devices have no CD drive - then you will need to use another laptop or PC to either transfer the CD's contents to a USB flashdrive, or else download them from tp-link.us web site and transfer to a USB flashdrive.Anyway, the install was very easy, and all I had to do was click on my router's ID, enter my password, and it was up and running.The wireless G performance is excellent, and the USB extension allowed me to find a point in my bedroom to position the adapter, that always has good wireless coverage from my router, so everything is cool now for using my laptop in bed. :)So far, I've had good experiences with TP-LINK products.

I get immediate headaches trying to watch a video. The same is true for reading. The backlit LCD is the worst reading experience I have ever had.I bought the device for the text to speech function removed from the regular kindles. But they killed it. It has a single female voice and the cadence is just weird. How am I suppose to get into sherlock holmes when Watson's voice is female?Moreover, the short cut or accessibility details should make the device easier to read... Well not if you have a child.

B00GP4BVTO,accessible,What are the camera features?,"Case works perfectly, keyboard feels great and the hotkeys are amazing! I was going to buy another case for 100 dollars at BB, but found this one on Amazon, and I am so happy I bought this one.One thing I do wish it had was magnets on the two bottom resting metals that hold the ipad when it is standing in landscape or portrait, cause if you accidentally tilt the ipad to much backwards, then the ipad has no locking mechanism to stay put and may fall backwards. This is really not a deal breaker for me cause i already know its like that so Im just more careful. Only problem maybe when someone that doesnt know about it, may pickup my ipad and not realize it and it may fall backwards. So a magnetic strong enough force to keep it standing would be an awesome upgrade.Overall, I am so happy.

I was using an audiophile grade cable before but switching between them there is no audible difference and the quality appears on par for a fraction of the price. The cable is thick, gold plated, has colour coding but doesn't have the price of most pro grade cables. I'm sure if tested properly they may find some small quibble why it isn't a true audiophile grade cable but for us mortals who cap the price of front speakers to $2000 or so these cables are a great deal for their quality, price and performance.

B0074BW614,comparable,How is the price?,"AWESOME, INCREDIBLE, Any other positive you can think of.  I have been thinking about getting a tablet for each of my daughters and have been reading reviews and checking out every device I can get my hands on.  I know I didn't want the el-cheepo tablets you can get for $99.  I've seen those and checked them out and they are tablets, but generally have older operating system, lack support, and don't support all the apps.  I didn't want a limited device.  I also didn't want to spend $350 per device either.  I have heard of people that got the Kindles and were very happy with them so I decided to take a chance and get 2 of them.  For the price of the refurb devices, with a percentage off e-coupon that I had, plus using my amazon points from my Amazon credit card, I was able to basically get 2 of these for the price of one.  I set my expectations a bit low because I didn't think of them as full tablets, but I'm happy to report I was rather wrong in that area.  I was very, very impressed with the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  I have a full 10 inch Acer Iconia tablet that I like and my kids like but it's a bit large for them.  This is the perfect size and feels so good in the hands.  The screen is very clear, and the sound these things produce is just amazing.  I couldn't believe how amazing the sound on these is, and how loud!  My kids are getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to see their jaws hit the ground!  Amazon uses a custom interface for the Android OS, but it doesn't make it any less functional. It is a bit different getting used to compared with the standard Android interface, but it works fine.  It was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with it.  Once you get used to the different interface, it's just as easy to get around in it as anything else, and if it's your first exposure to the world of tablet devices, I think it would be much easier to learn and get comfortable with.  I can't be happier with these things and actually, even though I have a 10 inch tablet, I'm very much considering getting one of these for me too.  I like it that much.Now, as for the refurbished part, don't be afraid of that word.  I get refurb stuff all the time and so far, here's what my experience is... they are great!  It seems like the refurb items have had all the bugs worked out and have had more rigorous testing than the new devices.  I've had plenty of new things stop working on me and had to get them replaced or repaired, but I've never had one single refurb device have any issue at all... ever (knock on wood!!).  These had no signs of ever having been used.  Not one single scratch or blemish, and Amazon's support is growing to be legend.  They want people to be happy with their purchases and will go the extra mile to ensure you are, so the support they offer is very good.I guess the bottom line is, if you are looking to get a tablet to start into the tablet world, or want something for the kids, then you have to consider this.  The price is excellent and it's a great tablet.  You won't be dissapointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND",cheepo tablets you can get for $ 99,"(240, 274)"

B001BTCSI6,several,How was the camera?,"After researching the internet and visiting camera stores for hands-on experience, I chose D700 without regret. There are many people out there trying to make the decision of the 3 wonderful cameras. I can only share my analysis based on my need and experience, as an avid amateur photographer.D600: the solid pro-sumer body feels the same as D7000, which I also own. Nikon transplanted the FX heart into a DX body. It is very natural for D7000 owners to upgrade to D600 for the ease of use on functions and layouts. However, I dislike the AF system concentrating mainly in the center, which can be challenging when trying to focus under certain situations. In addition, the problem of the occasional oil spell/dust on the sensor issue can be an indication of quality control problem of this model. I have tried to clean camera sensors before; it is far from easy to do so, wet or dry method. Therefore, most professionals dissuade the general public to do so and recommend leaving the job to the authorized dealers. Believe me, it is beyond annoying when you see spots on your pictures; and sometimes the spots appear in the place that can be very hard to correct.D800: nice pro heavy body with a huge 36mp sensor. Upgrading from a DX, I can not justify spending (jumping) thus much on such a powerful camera. Instead, as most professional photographers suggest, I will spend more on quality lenses, which usually out-last the cameras. If you own D800, you'd better have pro lenses. Otherwise, all the ""defects"" will show up in pictures with its huge and powerful sensor. In addition, D800 also has its own quality control issues, which is back focusing. Also, as an amateur, I tend to shoot more pictures than the pros, making sure I get the pictures I want. Therefore, I end up with a good number of pictures after an assignment and it takes time to process them. I am not ready to store (space-wise) and process (time-wise) big files from the D800 yet... maybe much later.D700: I picked this ""old"" camera over the two new models. It is a pro body, weather sealed, similar weight to D800. The layout is not too different from D7000 (thank goodness!) and easy to get used to. Since it is discontinued, the price dropped to the level that it is quite affordable, especially used ones, though be careful with the ""used"" condition, as it varies A LOT! This is the trial-and-true cameras, a work horse for many professionals. Despite having an older sensor, D700 still can produce exceptional images with wonderful sharpness and color rendition. Pairing it with the right lenses, you get ""gallery"" quality photos/prints. I don't worry too much of the ""small"" 12 mp sensor. As an amateur, most of us don't print over 2'x3' anyway. Its renowned focus system is outstanding, right on everything every time I shoot!I care about the image quality (what my eyes can see), body built (how my hands feel), and the focus system (the first and foremost ingredient in sharp image). I believe all these 3 cameras are capable of producing excellent pictures. Currently, the D700 fits my need, my budget, and the overall quality I am looking for. After all, all the equipments are ""tools"" at best. It is the photographer that takes good or bad pictures. A soft but well-composed picture is not as bad as a sharp yet meaningless one.

B009H8JOZS,thin,How is it bezel?,"Let me say straight off, I bought this locally and not from Amazon.  There was no difference in price and I wanted to see the floor model before I bought. But I like the Amazon user reviews, this is my 'go-to' site for user reviews so I want to contribute my experience with this TV.The 60 inch screen is BIG! Not TOO big, mind you, but big enough, and we have a large family room, I think. I'm glad I let my wife talk me out of that 70 inch screen.  It would have overpowered that room. I suspect you won't see many TVs much larger than 70 inches in size in the future, I can't imagine a room in a typical family home that could handle such a screen.  Remember, they look a lot smaller in the showroom! It replaced an old 48 inch 1st gen Panasonic rear projection HD TV that was showing its age (but was plenty big screen wise)Image quality and color is REALLY good, and I have not noticed the narrow angle of view issue that many reviews refer to and I think we have a wide viewing angle in our family room. Image quality is good EVEN when using 75 ohmn coax, IQ with the composite cables are at least as good as with coax.  We have digital, but not HD cable service, so I guess we get our signal in at 480p from cable, but the image is excellent, better than the old Panny.From other user reviews, I had done my research and was prepared to make the needed adjustments that would take care of any lip synch issues I might encounter.  However, I didn't have any lip synch problems.  I wonder if that issue is related to a certain brand or type of cable box.Netflix and Amazon have dedicated buttons on the remote so using them is EASY.  Netflix comes in at 720p as always, and the image is amazing on this TV. I don't use Amazon prime.Regarding the remote, it's pretty cool.  On one side, it is a standard remote with dedicated Netlix and Amazon buttons on the front, and on the flip side,it has a full QUERTY Chicklet type keyboard. On the keyboard side, there are also some gaming type control buttons.  You can download games from the app store (run by Yahoo on behalf of Vizio).  Other apps include Crackle, Hulu+, Vudu, etc. Pretty much similar in variety and in operation to the Roku store. More on this in a bit.The sound is typical tiny and tinny tv sound.  But in defense, the bezel (the frame) around the screen is only about 1/2 inch wide and an inch or so deep, not a lot of space for room filling speakers.  I think we will buy a sound bar for this set eventually.  But I have some spare higher quality PC speakers, in the meantime, I will look into hooking them up.Edit 1/15/13:I've tried to hook up my computer speakers to this TV only to discover that there is no 3.5 mm mini-plug outlet.  There are 2 RCA audio connections on the back and theoretically you can get a converter that converts to a female mini-plug, but Best Buy and HH Greg don't seem to carry them.  I guess I could order from Amazon or other internet vendor, but it seems kind of crazy to pay all that shipping if you don't have other things to buy.  I'll try Radio Shack across town later today.Major problem? No, but a bit of a pain, yes.  The 3.5 mini-plug socket should be part of any device with audio, in my mind.End of Edit:Set up was kind of odd. My Comcast cable box is considered an antenna source if using 75 ohm coax, but a cable connection if using composite cables on the same cable box. (My Comcast Cable box doesn't have HDMI).  The directions could have been clearer on this.I think the User Interface for set up is kind of complex and not very intuitive. I think it could be easier to use. As I said earlier, you have the ability to download apps to the TV from Yahoo even a few games and special Yahoo content apps, however that process seems kind of hidden.  Once you get to it, it works great and it's easy, but getting there is a tad difficult.  That being said, it is unlikely a child would accidentally get there and download something you don't want on your set.The wireless internet connectivity works pretty well.  My wireless router is about 40 feet away on the same floor as the TV.  Set up was relatively easy, but the TV set could be a little better in telling you the status of your connection. I had connected to my router on the first try, but hadn't realized it.  So I kept trying to complete the connection and it kept telling me that all it could find were my neighbor's networks.  Finally I realized it also kept telling me that the network I was on might be a bit slow.  (It isn't, trust me, this, I know) So I tried to get on to Netflix, and son of a gun! it worked!All the confusion aside, once you get the TV set up the way you like, the day to day operation is pretty straight forward and not difficult to use. But getting there could be easier.  Vizio needs to work on the out of box user experience I think.I feel I got a lot for my money, and I would buy it again.  If the users are tech savvy, then they should not hesitate to buy this TV.  But if the users need help setting up a regular tv then they will need someone to help them set this TV up for sure.  But like I said earlier, the day to day operation is pretty easy.  Even grandma should be able to use the set day to day (and even use Netflix and Amazon Prime!)I'm a happy camper with a HUGE TV.

B000I68BD4,high,Is the review rating not good ?,"The good news is that these earbuds sound pretty good.

Both provided far superior noise reduction; the Shure qualify as a deluxe set of earplugs, very nice on airplanes.  The Shure provided much better sound quality, the Koss was about the same sound quality.  Both were better construction (though both were still broken within a year).  The Koss was about equally comfortable; the Shure was much more comfortable, due both to better design and a wider selection of earpieces.

B009PK9S90,better,Do you think the audio is very strong?,"We have been using the Hero 2 for a couple of years and have loved it.  We use our Hero for taking video of skiing, rafting, body boarding, and getting underwater images.  So we were excited to give the Hero 3 a try.  The Hero 2 is a great camera, and the Hero 3 follows in that tradition, but the redesign has resulted in a few problem areas.  Below are the pros and cons after nearly four weeks of use:Pros-  It is perhaps 30% thinner than the Hero 2.  The slim form factor is immediately noticeable and welcome.  I always felt the 2 was too bulky.- Using the menu system is about the same.  That is, you use a pair of buttons to navigate through a series of two-level menus.  Your options show up on the small LCD screen on the front of the Hero.  The great thing about the Hero 3 Black Edition is that you can control the menus via a mobile iOS app over WiFi.  The app greatly enhances the the ease of use of the Hero 3.  If you don't  use the app (or the add-on LCD screen), be sure you practice navigating the menus and understanding the camera's features before you use it.  The menu and features are moderately intuitive but we need to refer to the user's manual for one-off features.- The WiFi on the Black version is great.  As mentioned before, the iOS app let's you change the camera's settings, but it also allows you to preview what the camera sees without having to buy the $70 LCD add-on.  Using the WiFi feature was very easy and makes this camera worth the price.  You can remotely start recording set the recording features (resolution, time lapse, etc.)  The Black edition also comes with a rechargeable wireless remote that replicates the small monochrome LCD screen on the Hero 3. You can navigate the two-level menu on your remote like you would on the Hero 3 itself.- The quality of the captured video is amazing.  You can select resolutions from VGA through 4k cinema quality.  We use ours at HD resolution and get great results.  The lens is wide angle, so you capture all of the action.- The camera is very versatile.  One of our favorite features is the looping feature that allows the camera to loop back over itself.- You can save your video in RAW camera format to do significant post-processing.  This is a great feature for pros.  It also has a ""Protune"" feature that records at 24 fpm (a TV standard).- You can take photos while it records video.  This feature works great, giving us clear wide-angle shots.- The LCD and extra battery pack that we used with our Hero 2 also work with the Hero 3CONS- The camera is fast and responsive, but a couple of times the camera has frozen while I'm paging through menus.  I have the latest firmware update, so maybe another one is needed by GoPro.  We have to shutdown the camera to unfreeze it.- The sound is decent, but not super-clear.  GoPro makes it clear that using the waterproof case will muffle the sound.  Well, that's the price you pay for a waterproof case.  With the standard case, the sound is better.  Without a case, the sound is very acceptable (but it still doesn't match the quality of the video).  We have not tried out the external mic, but it wold be a good idea to use it if great sound is important to you.- The battery life is only about two hours in our best case.  A second battery would a good idea.CONCLUSIONA great camera.  It is the first generation of an overhaul, so you might well-served waiting for the Hero 4, but the Hero 3 really is a good choice if you want to get your adventures on film.  We love using it for filming wildlife (using the MiFi iOS app), on rollercoasters, etc.  THe positives definitely outweigh the negatives.  Fun, versatile, professional camera.

B005HMO6A6,cool,What do you think of the artistic design?,"I really don't have anything new to report after reading many of the reviews, I just wanted to add my comments.I purchased the Airbender keyboard and case to compare it to the Logitech aluminum case. WIth the latter, I used the keyboard infrequently however every time that I went to use it, I took a considerable number errors and miskeys until I got into the swing of it. My opinion is that the keys are just to close together on the keyboard and hence I regularly ended up pushing both adjacent keys.Enter the Airbender. The first thing I notice, and looked for, was a tad of spacing between the keys and was pleased to see it. This is achieved I feel by reducing the size of the keys from 16mm on the Logitech to 14mm on the Airbender. Hence there is, in my opinion,  just enough space to allow me to type without constant errors. I did find that the right shift key was a little awkwardly spaced to the right of the ""page up"" key and it is a little small, however with time I am sure I will get used to it.As previously mentioned by other reviewers, the clamshell mechanism is a little fiddly to get it situated however, when it is finally set up, bingo! I especially like the way it can be either landscape or portrait or anything in-between if you so desire unlike other clamshells on the market. The ability to be able to detach the iPad quickly from the keyboard is ingenious and useful although I did, again, find it a little fiddly re-attaching however I am sure practice will make perfect. Compared to the Logictech which, when the iPad is stowed away, is very sleek and has a nice look due to the aluminum case, the Airbender is a little more bulky however the practicality of the product outweighs the negative of this feature.I think I read that it was not possible to charge the iPad while the case is closed however mine seems to be able to do this without a problem. I also read that the auto off function using, I presume, magnets was spotty and I have to say I have also found this. That being said, I usually manually switch off my iPad and keyboard prior to closing the case so it is not an issue. In the case that I do forget, hopefully the timer auto off will work however I am not sure if this will happen if the case is linked with the bluetooth keyboard. Either way, this is certainly not a big issue in my mind.All in all, I think this is a well designed and thought out case. It is exactly what I needed and , although bulkier than the Logictech, I am very pleased I purchased it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants the benefit of a true keyboard as opposed to the screen keyboard.

B0001FTVEK,not clear,How clear was the sound?,"These were my first wireless headphones after using corded headphones for years. I realize they are probably considered on the low end for wireless, but I did expect at least decent performance and some ability to enjoy music. The headphones are light and not uncomfortable. The recharger works just fine and the distance range is OK. Other than that, they are a total disappointment. The dynamic range seems very compressed around the vocal frequencies with the higher frequencies the most affected although the bass is also weak. Virtually none of my music sounds good. Only a few things which were already lacking in dynamic range originally sound just OK. Too much range and listening enjoyment is simply lost with these headphones.  I don't like them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",sounds good,"(559, 570)"
B001QTXL82,bad,How do you like the screen?,"Last summer I bought an Asus EEE PC 4G and was generally pleased with the tiny laptop. However, there were three things that I thought needed improvement: the keyboard, the screen, and storage. In each case, my thought was that they could be a bit larger (but not too large-after all, the main appeal of the EEE PC netbooks is their small size). The EEE PC 1000H provides those improvements and more-and for only a bit more than I paid for my first EEE PC.The main virtue of the EEE PC 1000 H is its small size and light weight. While it is larger than my 4G, it is considerably smaller and lighter than my iBook (dimensions and weight are given below). In practical terms, it fits easily into my rather over-stuffed backpack and does not add noticeably to its weight.  Naturally, if small size is of critical importance, Asus does make even smaller netbooks, such as the 4G and more recent versions.While small size is important, it is really not very useful to have a PC that is too small to use comfortably. While my 4G was quite usable, the 1000H is, from my standpoint, an ideal size. The keyboard is smaller than that of a typical laptop, but the key design and size allows for easy typing-much more so than the 4G. With the 4G I tended to just use one finger typing. With the 1000h I can type normally. The screen is also larger, allowing for easier viewing of documents. Of course, with a height of only 600 it does still impose some limits. I found the screen to be high quality-sharp and responsive. There is also a VGA output, in case you want to attach it to an external monitor.My 4G had a 4 GB SSD drive while my 1000H has a 160 GB HD. The downside of the standard hard drive is that it has moving parts and is a bit slower in booting up relative to the SSD. On the plus side, it has far greater capacity. The 4GB on the 4G was enough for the Linux OS and the base applications, but I had to rely on SD cards and USB keys for extra storage. The 1000H does have the SD reader and plenty of USB ports, but it has considerable storage space. Oddly, the hard drive is partitioned and mounts as two volumes (there are are also hidden volumes as well).While I did not buy a netbook for speed, my 1000H is quite responsive, even running Windows XP. I did not try any recent games, but it runs Starcraft and Diablo II just fine. Microsoft Office was also quite snappy. Overall, most users will find it quite adequate for their needs. Obviously, if you ant to play the latest games or edit video, you will want a laptop with more power. But, it does give a lot of power for the cost.For a low price netbook, it does pack in quite a few extras that you'd expect to only see on something a bit higher up the food chain. These include ethernet, multiple USB 2.0 ports, wireless N, and bluetooth. Everything worked well-it connected to my wireless N network without a hitch. I'm not a big fan of Bluetooth, but it is nice to have that option.It ships with fairly minimal software-mostly just the OS, some very basic utilities and a trial of Office 2007. I actually see this a plus-I hate pulling crapware off my PC and would rather have a nice, clean system. I did consider installing Ubuntu, but decided to stick with XP so I could run Office, Starcraft, Diablo II, and my windows based grading program. Yes, I could probably get everything going in WINE, but I decided to just keep things simple. Besides, my 4G is running Linux.Asus claims that the battery will last for 9.5 hours. I haven't put that to the test, but it is nice to have long battery life. After all, the main point of getting a netbook is so you can easily have it with you. Good battery life is part of this.Mine came with a basic soft case, but I bought a more robust one. If you plan to toss yours into a backpack or travel with it, I'd suggest a case upgrade.Overall, the 1000H is an excellent little machine. If you are looking for a travel laptop, an inexpensive laptop, or one to use at school, this is a great choice. I plan to use mine for both travel (once I can travel again) and at school. My backpack always seems to be packed with notes, student papers, records, my lunch, a water bottle and various other things-so small and light netbook is ideal. I did like my 4G a great deal, but it was just a bit too small for typing and easily entering grades. Hence, I mainly just used it when traveling. But, the 1000H is as comfortable to use as a normal laptop and hence I plan to get much more use from it.So, should you get one? My experience has been that most people tend to over buy when it comes to laptops. That is, they get a machine that far exceeds their needs. After all, surfing the web, doing an email and doing word processing do not take that much power. The 1000H provides more than enough power to do all that and at a very low price (well under $400). Naturally, I'd suggest trying one in person to see if you like the keyboard and screen size; but I think that most people will rather like this machine.

B005DKZTMG,easy to type,How is the keyboard?,"Ordered this for my HTPC in the living room. I picked it up because there are times when you can't just get by with a remote. This thing does everything that I need it to. It is a functional keyboard. I have big hands and even though it is a reduced size keyboard, I find typing on it to be easy. The touchpad works great. If there were one thing wrong with the touchpad, it might be that the sensitivity is just a hair low.The build quality is decent, but I wouldn't leave this thing out to get stepped on or dropped repeatedly.

B0030MITDK,fantastic,Do you know film a video?,"Okay we all know this isn't a replacement for a full blown camcorder and certainly not a camera, BUT it is a great product. I personally bought it for it's waterproof capabilities. It takes a DECENT still shot, more than good enough for social networks or emails. More importantly though, the video that it shoots is outstanding. Better than most I've had experience with taken by cameras, plus it's waterproof. I have mentioned that a couple of times now because I feel that is the key aspect with this product.This is a fun camera and small enough to throw in a pocket. Getting to the details on video I have to say that outdoors is where it shines. Indoor shots with normal lighting are also good but low light are viewable but somewhat grainy. Underwater video is equally good. You MUST turn that mode on. Each time the camera is turned off it resets and must be turned on again. It just compensates for the lighting underwater. I've forgotten to turn it on and the video looks good? The digital zoom is remarkably good. Usually digital zoom tends to be less than ideal but this camcorder handles it very well! Much better than expected. I don't hesitate to use it at all, even on full zoom it's good. The manual does not say what the zoom is nor does the camera. People here in the reviews have estimated and I'd GUESS 4-5x.As for the video modes 720p 30fps isn't bad. The picture is sharp and has great color. There can be some shakey almost slightly strobe light effect if you move the camera too fast. The built in image stabilization does help BUT you must turn it on. 720p 60fps is the bomb! I think this is the sweet spot and use this mode most of the time. 1080p 30fps is wonderful though you must again be careful with the camera movement. The image is just plain crisp!! Don't get me wrong this mode is great but it takes a lot of memory and isn't really practical for emailing or uploading to social networks. Looks beautiful on my 58 in. Samsung plasma.Stills as I said are good and a couple outdoor shots I took rival my better camera. Parties, walks on the beach, hanging with friends are good venues for the stills. Important parties, weddings, those moments that really mean something, no, use a dedicated real camera.Battery life is pretty decent. I shoot 30 sec. to 1 min. most of the time then power off and it has lasted through 2 serious parties 40-50 vids at each party with time to spare. Not sure if you just turned it on and let it go for like 5-10 min. vids? My guess is that it wouldn't last as long. That's the WORST way to take vids anyway!! Nothing is worse than a 5 minute or longer video to watch!! OMG, please don't ever force a vid of that length on a friend. Because you can't say anything and have to sit through the whole horrid thing. Show the same vid in 1 min or less clips and it's acceptable. Just my opinion.This has been a great purchase for me. As said the waterproof capability is what sold me. If you don't want to lug the camcorder and camera along this just pops in the pocket. It's inexpensive and FUN, buy it you won't regret itP.S. I think it's as nice or nicer than the Flip. Comparing it to my friends Flip, the vids are the same but this is WATERPROOF! ANSWERNOTFOUND",digital,"(992, 999)"

B005JN9310,bright,How is the monitor?,This is a very nice monitor that meets all my expectations.  It is replacing a 5 year old Samsung monitor that just failed in a triple monitors setup.  The older Samsung was a higher end one in the Samsung lineup at the time.  The U2412M is a little clearer and has good color.  The monitor is thinner and lighter and the base has a smaller footprint allowing me to set the monitor so it is further back on my desk reclaiming a few inches of desk space.  Since it is LED backlit it uses much less power than my other monitors.  I'm considering replacing the other monitors with U2412M monitors although it is hard to bite the bullet on that since the other monitors are working OK and they look fine next to each other for my purposes (data and charts).  I bought this at a higher price from one vendor on Amazon as they offered Amazon Prime shipping (overnight is $3.99) and I needed the monitor right away.

B0012S4APK,fast,How is the shipment?,"The instructions are adequate.  You shouldn't have ay problems understanding them.  I did run into one issue.  The mount is not compatible with all TV's.

HOWEVER, the LG I bought has integrated speakers that are &#34;down firing&#34; in the base and the bottom is approximately 3/4 of an inch wider than anywhere else on the TV.  So, after I placed the TV on the wall, because the bottom speaker was slightly larger, I could not get to the safety screw of the mount.  So, the TV is hanging, but, the safety screws are not tightened.  You can't ever so slightly pull the TV from the wall either or the screws will not line up.  Does it work? Yes.

B006K551LM,removable,How are battery?,"Updated Review:On the surface this looks like a nice camera. Compact, HD video and stills, and Wi-Fi connectivity to convenient sharing sites.There is good and bad.I originally felt there was a lot more BAD with this camera, but after additional testing I have given this camera a better rating.At this time the Bloggie cannot connect to Facebook: Trying to do so takes the user to a SONY web page that informs you that the Facebook upload service is temporarily not working and will not be available ""until December"". (Note, I am writing this in March.) The SONY rep I spoke with says they are currently working on this issue and the December Date is not realistic. He believes it will be corrected in the next couple of weeks. I have to mention, that Sony's customer service did help me through a few the problems I was having with set-up and function. This made the difference between me returning the camera and keeping it.Connecting and Uploading to my I-phone via wi-fi is a little touchy. When it works; it works fine. There are times when I am in areas that something, in the air, blocks the signal between the two devices. When it works this is a convenient feature. I bought this camera so I would not tax my I-phone with home video file bloat. It's nice to be able to grab a picture from the Bloggie via wi-fi and then edit the image using one the photo editing apps I have on my I-phone.Uploading to You-tube worked. I didn't run into any problems uploading a video to You-Tube and video appeared on the site in a minute.Connecting to Playmemories, the Sony photo/video upload site, worked well. The connection to the site was not always solid and uploaded images dropped about 25% of the times I tried. I can't tell if this is a wi-fi problem or a problem with the Playmemories site. Maybe I am missing a control feature, but I noticed that ALL photos and Videos upload to the site upon connecting. I would prefer that it allowed me to check images and videos for uploading.Recording LIVE video to the QIK web site, after an account is set up, worked really well. I was actually impressed at how easy this was.At first I was really disappointed in the fact that the focus ring creates a tapping noise that can be heard on the video. After additional testing I have found that the condenser mic hears this woodpecker-tapping sound when there is no other sound in the room. The mic opens up and listens for sound and the sound it picks up is the focus mechanism. I noticed that the tapping sound was not loud when other sounds were in the room. Considering I am using this movie for blogging and home vacation home movies, this tapping is no longer much of a bother to me.The video is very clear. The focus function is slow to react to subject distance changes. I would suggest setting up a shot if you can, tap the screen so the camera focuses on your subject and then start recording.At another Amazon customer's suggestion, I tested the recording length time:In HD, the camera stayed in record mode for 24 1/2 minutes before it stopped recording. It does not automatically start recording another file. You have to start a new recording manually. This isn't a problem for home movie recording, but it would be a problem if you're recording a performance, play, musical event or other lengthy topic where you would want the camera to keep rolling. If this is your need, get a bigger camera.While recording video you can press the snapshot button on the top of the camera and get some nice still-shots on the fly. I really liked this feature.The images are crisp but I feel the shutter speed is a little slow so, if your subject is moving, expect a little blurring.I used kept this camera in my pocket over the last few days and really used it. I recorded indoors and outdoors and, despite a few out-of-focus shots, I really got some nice clean, crisp video that I'm happy with.I wish SONY had allowed for a memory bump via a card slot.After getting the camera set-up on my computer, connection and image upload has been really easy. The files are compatible with all of my video editing programs and the video looks really nice when it's burned to DVD.For the money I spent, I couldn't find anything else on the market that offered what this camera does.

B00ATM1MGA,big,How big is the camera?,"Bridge cameras are a quirky lot: they're essentially a point-and-shoot camera with DSLR-like features.  For the HS50EXR, the phrase &#34;DSLR-like&#34; sums it up almost entirely.There are many reviews on Amazon and elsewhere that touch on the HS50's main features, so I won't go into those beyond saying that the manual zoom is great and the image quality (which has been spoken poorly about in some cases) is actually quite good.  This review is intended to hit on features that might not get immediate consideration when you're looking for a bridge camera.I purchased the HS50EXR as a backup to my DSLR, something that would be easy to carry and that my wife (who is not a photographer) could use and get good results.  Also, I needed something with strong video capabilities that would auto-focus well.  This camera delivers in spades.  It's fantastic, full-featured, and easy for my wife to use but with enough control to give experienced photographers plenty to play with.A few points that don't get much press about this camera:Focus Ring: This camera features manual focus via a free-spinning focus ring behind the zoom ring.  The focus control is strictly electronic, but the focus ring has a quick, responsive, and organic feel to it.  Obviously, for video work you'd want to be able to exert a bit more control over focus, but overall it's impressive.  In photo mode, there are focus highlights that appear on whatever the lens is focused on, a useful feature that the Magic Lantern crowd will recognize and appreciate.  Sadly, that same crowd will be sorely disappointed to find out this feature is not present in video mode.  Video mode will allow manual focus, of course, but without the handy focus peak highlights.Bayonet/58mm Lens: This camera includes a bayonet-style tulip lens hood (which was impressive to me), and also accepts 58mm lens accessories.  That was my big gripe about other bridge cameras; there was no way to provide the glass with any protection.  The HS50EXR lets you put a UV filter on the front, which is especially crucial considering you don't have the luxury of replacing a lens if it gets dinged up.Video Quality:  One of the best things about this camera is its video quality.  It is sharp, responsive, quick to focus, maintains focus easily, and there are a number of high-fps options for slow-motion video.  Of course, the faster the shutter goes, the lower your resolution gets, but if you're looking to capture something cool at a high frame rate, this will definitely do it.  One disappointment for video mode is that you are not allocated any control over exposure, so no aperture, shutter speed, etc that you would get on a DSLR.Articulated Screen:  This is great for videographers like myself who need to frame a shot while being in front of the lens.  Very handy.Q Button:  This is a great feature for the camera to have.  In true DSLR fashion, you have a dedicated screen to adjust ISO, white balance, shutter speed, aperture, etc.  Fantastic, easy to use, and handy.Now, there are a few things that I would have changed on this camera that keep it from getting a full 5 stars:Plastic Tripod Socket:  This camera is big and heavy, like a small DSLR.  The tripod socket is a heavy-duty hard plastic, but I would have much rather had something metal.Lack of Control in Video Mode:  I like that you can use manual focus in video mode, but other than that you get what the camera gives you, which is not exactly what I want.  Still, the video mode is great on its own.Sensor Size:  This is the biggest difference between the HS50EXR and a true DSLR.  Even an entry level DSLR will dwarf the 1/2&#34; sensor that this camera sports.  The HS50EXR's sensor is the most tangible throwback to its point-and-shoot roots, but don't write it off immediately.  While you'll never fool anyone into thinking your shots came from a DSLR, you'll be sure to get some excellent looking shots.  Even some camcorders at this price level have smaller sensors than this, so it's not as bad as people say it is.  In fact, I think considering its size, the images look amazing, but I would have liked to see Fuji use a bigger sensor to live up to the DSLR features and aesthetics.If you're looking for a good family camera that's a jack-of-all-trades that yields great results, this is what you're after.  If you're on the fence about this camera and a full-fledged DSLR, go with the DSLR.  I was glad I purchased a DSLR before purchasing this camera because it gave me a much better sense about what the HS50EXR can and can't do.  Once you understand its limitations and capabilities, you can really start making great images with this camera.  I definitely recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",quite good .,"(420, 431)"

B003VAM32E,poor,How long is the battery life?,"Logitech G700 ReviewPROS:- Good tracking / High Precision (5700dpi max, read further)- Nano Receiver- Good ergonomics: I personally like the G700's shape and feel. I don't think it's heavier than it needs to be for a solid, positive movement and I can use it for hours, even corded without strain.- The 13 buttons can be programmed for 5 different profiles - Using Setpoint 5.44.5 works like a charm. The tactile feel of them is fine for my needs. I would prefer less of clicking noises using left / right and center mouse buttons.- Finishing is great matte black - less cheesy than the G500 or other ""gaming mice"". Probably a Con for ppl that like showing off, but...- User replaceable AA rechargeable Eneloop battery.- You can charge it while you use it. The ""wired"" mode transition is seamless - at least with the drivers I've used -  but some reviewers disagree on that. Setpoint 5.44.5 on Win 7 64bit never produced a freeze or loss of settings while hot-plugging the USB cable while the mouse was used.- Matte finish easy to grip. Feels ""different"" than the normal rubber padded mice, but will probably last longer too. Grip is quite positive, no concerns.- Includes USB extension cable for wireless receiver - more of a desktop user easement. Range is great for laptop use, works out to 3 feet / 1 meter easily, never had need for more.CONS:- Big, not ideal for slipping it in your laptop's slim carrying messenger bag, but nothing terrible. &lt;- actually I do carry it around in my slim messenger belkin, but that's me...- Noisy clicks...I would prefer it more subtle for ""stealth"" gaming. Hard for someone to miss what you are doing with loud blazing clicks when in the heat of battle!- Charge only via powered USB port (well, I wouldn't like to drag a docking station around, so, no biggie)- Slightly elevated slope might be uncomfortable to some - definitely not a ""claw""-grip. Works Ok with my middle-sized hands.- Does not include a unifying nano-receiver (guess the ""G series"" nano provides faster response? nothing i can feel tho)- Battery life is nothing to talk home about, but not terrible, and you can replace it almost on the fly (or hook the USB cable). On par or better with most high performance mice, that are tied to Li-Ion proprietary battery packs.This review follows almost 3 weeks after the mouse has been purchased.Main thoughts -- Productivity PerformanceUsed the G700 in a variety of applications, mainly design programs and games. The 5 available profiles work a charm and you can program the driver to ""sense"" the application's .exe and switch profiles on the fly: switching between say - Autodesk Revit and SketchUp to Adobe Illustrator and back for copy-pasting etc, the software follows you switching profiles seamlessly, altering assigned macros for the thumb / side buttons. Each profile can have it's own DPI setting and DPI steps that you can then hard-set on the fly on the mouse. The profiles are stored on the mouse's internal mem-bank too, so you take those settings with you to use on multiple PCs.- Gaming PerformanceThe real performance difference is in games tho, where you really feel the increase in precision despite the dpi used - I doubt that people can positively utilize more than 2000dpi on their mice, with me finding a limit close to the 1600dpi. Above that you cannot be precise enough for anything but laid back internet browsing.I do play MMOs (EVE online), where the extra buttons can do macros etc just fine but precision is not that critical. In the more demanding FPS world, the mouse clearly shines. To be honest I've never had complains on the responsiveness of the VX Nano or the Microsoft's Mobile 4000, yet the G700 beats them on all surfaces. Almost any cheap cloth mouse-pad (used it on black and grey) did improve the feel of it over bare desktop surfaces.Tracking while you snipe is great, and sensitivity is easily adjusted by the default keys left of your right index finger. You can customize the dpi switching to be assigned to any key, with +/- steps in independent keys or looping through the settings with just one key.The ""extra"" G keys have a positive feel and I personally found them quite easy to find and identify just with touch. Unlike other reviewers, I did like the thumb keys and I can use them each and every time without missing or guessing. All of them work for both a slight ""upward/in"" movement of the thumb, or direct depression. Did not run into locking problems when using more than 2-3 buttons at a time (speaking on coms, using assigned macros and/or firing etc).Response is great and you cannot tell between wired and wireless.- Side status LEDs3 triangle LEDs live on the left side of the G700. With 3x primary colors, indicate the profile in use in case you manually switch(orange - 5 steps), DPI used (Red, 5 steps) and battery life (Green, 3 steps, with a single Red coming on when battery is really low).- More on the sensor's DPI ratingRemember tho that most ""common"" optical mice dance around the 800-1000 dpi range, and with today's screen real-estate (typical 1920x1080) and dual screen configs being  common, many times you need to move a 800dpi mouse along your mouse-pad and even lift/return it for some more to go from one edge to the other. The software allows you to set 5 dpi steps for each profile, and I have none going above 3200 dpi (nor did the factory settings).- BatteryThe mouse comes with a single Sanyo Eneloop battery, and typically lasts about 2 days of work/gaming. Keep in mind that I do use my computer at least 10 hours a day, so I am happy with that. Charging usually completes within 3-4 hours while in use. Never timed it tho. The ""low battery"" indicator does come up on your screen, but as other reviewers mentioned, it's too conservative and you do have at least a couple of hours - or more - of usage after the warning.Personally I would prefer 2x AA batteries in parallel (like with the M705 marathon) for better battery life. Also keep in mind that despite the fact that the Eneloop is one of the highest quality NiMH batteries out there, their rated capacity is 1900-2000mAh, while most high capacity AA NiMH are rated around 2500-2700mAh. I tend to believe that the Eneloops would shine on low-drain, long battery life applications, something the G700 is clearly not. I don't have a spare 2700mAh (I use them in my flash units), but I believe the G700 would be better paired with such cells.- Corded use and chargingAgain, the transition from wireless to wired mod was seamless in my experience and the latest drivers.The cord is not the softest around, but I never felt it ""stiff"" and uncomfortable as some reported. It's an ok cord. Not as soft as many silicon-skinned cords some mice used, but works fine for me.The USB wire connector utilizes a micro-USB male plug on the G700's end. That means that any such cable could work for both using and charging the mouse. For the latter, probably any 5V mobile phone charger would work  too, for those who desperately need an off-USB charging device (many PCs do power their USBs when in sleep mode, so charging is happening even when the machine is not ""on""). Micro USB is supposed to be the EU standard for cell phone charging since 2010 (Apple, Nokia, Samsung, LG, Motorola etc among others agreed on using it universally) so more and more devices will provide compatible chargers.- Why the G700? So many Mice out there!As I was mostly on the move, I do appreciate wireless mice, and I've been spoiled by the nano-receiver on my Logitech VX Nano for more than 2 years now. The thing is simply amazingly versatile and quite fool-proof (not in a few occasions people had damaged the  dongle, destroyed a USB port or both due to them protruding in the wrong place at a wrong time.Since I've bought the VX nano, I've used a couple of mice on friends computers and/or tried some on mine. I did not fail to notice that the old generation Laser ""848nm"" sensor they VX Nano and most of the nano-receiver mice Logitech produced the last few years (V220, M505, M705) did lack in tracking precision, even against relatively cheaper competitors like the Microsoft Mobile 4000 mouse - a unit that if it wasn't for the extremely jerky/cheap feel of its wheel/center button would be almost perfect for the &lt;$20 price many vendors sell it for.Since I liked the Hyper-Fast scroll wheel in my VX nano, but I've hated the fact that the center mouse button was not on the wheel, the main contenders for replacing it where all full scaleLogitech mice, which provided all of:* Hyper-scroll wheel + center mouse button with positive feel* Better tracking than the VX nano* Ideally wireless with nano-receiver.* At least 2-3 programmable buttons, but not as badly placed as on the VX Nano.* Not really expensive - I ended up buying on the high end of my budget but most competitive ""gaming"" mice offered less features for the same price.The G700 was chosen over:- The G500 - seemed a great mouse, but cheesy in appearance and not really cheaper in the long run especially since it's only wired.- The Performance MX. Relatively better battery life, but not that better (still a high precision sensor with only one AA battery), not cheaper, less buttons (that many will not use anyways), with a unified nano receiver. I believe it would be a great alternative if it was actually cheaper. Has the ""glass capable"" dark field technology, but I never planned on using it on glass.- G400/300 - only wired, cheap(er) feel, great tracking. Don't like the right side buttons on the G300.Anywhere Mouse MX: All the pros of the VX nano, and all the cons too, but the 2 side buttons placement. Nothing a VX nano owner will actually want, unless you have to use it on glass and/or really need a unified receiver to use with a keyboard or something.- M705 ""Marathon"" mouse: Did not promise better tracking, but would give great autonomy and a definitely better battery life. Unifying receiver, way better scroll wheel than the nano-mice - if you care for middle clicking...off center sensor etc where never annoyances for my game style.6 month Update:After 6 months with the G700, I have nothing more to say that it still feels a great buy. I use it daily for design/drafting and gaming. Battery life is mediocre, but will easily last 20 or so hours of use in my hands. The matte finishing still looks great, with only a hint of skin grease visible on the left button. G keys never missed a beat thus far. Wish it had a unifying receiver to be perfect (ended up getting a K series unified keyboard for my laptop and I get to use 2x USB ports just for input devices).9 month Update:Rock and solid in every department other than battery life. Tried an old GP 2700mAh and still the mouse needs to be plugged every other day the most - and I am not using it @ 1000 reports /sec for productivity tasks which is 90%+ of the hours it is used. Got used to it, but Logitech should definitely consider a 2x AA design for the next flagship mouse, even if they come up with reduced consumption components.

B0034XRDUA,nice,How is the shape?,"I have had it.  This mouse is terrible.  I've got a cheap bundled no-name mouse on my laptop, and I'm stealing it and throwing this one away.  Even that mouse is better than this one.The biggest problem with this mouse is the tendency to double click when a button has been clicked once.  It started two months after I got the mouse.  At first it was now and then, making me think I'd clicked twice.  Six months later, it's a constant thing, probably about 80% of the time.The tracking is also not great.  With a mouse pad it's bearable, without one it's impossible.  Either way, sometimes small movements just don't happen at all.  I'm never really sure where the pointer will be when I move the mouse.The three year battery life was good for about 6 months.  To me that's not a big deal.

B0036AWR8E,large,How is the compartment?,"I recently bought the Slingshot 302AW, hoping to be able to carry two bodies (and some extra lenses and accessories) and still enjoy the fast access of a sling bag.But I cannot find the right configuration for this bag. It is big enough, but the freedom to arrange the internal space is very limited.The main limit is the fixed divider between the upper and the lower compartments.The upper compartment is just a little too small for another body (Sony A700 with VG or Minolta Maxxum 9 with VG with wide-normal lens).The lower compartment is too big for one body, but a little too small for two bodies.After some tries, I managed to fit two bodies in the lower compartment (although the Velcro is very limited), but then I have no fast access to my equipment and I have to take the bag off to get something out.So I don't really understand this bag - if I want fast access for one body, I'll use a smaller bag. If I am giving up the option for fast access and carry two bodies, I will use backpack which is way more convenient.I feel very frustrated - I like this bag, it is very sturdy and comfortable. It is big and has the potential to be exactly what I am looking for. But it is not...AFTER READING THE COMMENTS TO MY REVIEW:This bag might not be designed to carry two bodies. That's true. But the complain is about the fact that the bag is big and has a lot of space, and yet there is no enough space for a setup I can carry with a much smaller bag. Each photographer has his/her own style and his/her own kit. That's why most of the modern camera bags contains dividers that can be moved around. Before I bought that bag I checked how much space it has and I mistakenly assumed that I will be able to use this space as I wish. That is the usual case with camera bags (at least that is the case with the other Lowepro models I own).In that sense, the older versionLowepro SlingShot 300 All-Weather Camera Bag (Black)is better because you can attach the dividers anywhere in the main compartment.

B001V9LPT4,high,How do you get so high?,"I ordered a pair of these for my dad and I about 6 months ago. My dad loves his old music and didn't think headphones were a big deal until he got these from me for x-mas. I think I accidentally turned him into a bit of an audiophile lol. As for myself, I love these things.The quality is truly amazing. The bass is VERY clean even at very high levels and not overwhelming by any means. The mids and highs are very very nice as well. You can hear so many things extra going on in your music than before making it a completely new experience even with a mobile device. I even tried these out on my FiiO e10 amp/dac and they are even more amazing!I've listened to other earbuds and found these are the best suited for me at a decent price. I can wear these all day long for days on end and not even notice them being in. By far the most comfortable I have ever had. Another great point is the noise cancelling. There is this fat redneck piece of crap that rides in the back of the bus that never ever shuts up with the most annoying girlish cackle that puts you into an instant rage when wanting to sleep. These buds with a very low volume drowns him out very well surprisingly and I sleep great! Definitely a huge bonus when I am away from home for 17 hours a day.Beats headphones are a bloody joke! It annoys me to no end to see people buying that garbage just because it's signed by an uneducated rapper. :\ I've had a lot of earbuds to know those things don't even compare to the cheapest plastic ear ripping garbage out there. My coworkers I ride the bus with (very long ride every day ugh) are so brainwashed thinking they can somehow justify that massive price they paid. I showed them mine and I could see them lie when they said the Beaters were better. I'll enjoy my music thank you and they can continue to have an orgy of stray cats fighting over living territory in their ears.In summary, I'm far from being an audiophile. Very far. From my experience, headphones were always just that: headphones. Now I've realized they can be so much more! From my experiences, these babies pretty much alleviate any complaints of other headphones I have had in the past.

B009B0MZ1M,perfect,How is the camera?,"My wife and I are birders and are always on the look for a camera with great zooming ability that is still sufficiently light to carry. We have owned Canon's prior model, the SX40, for just 2 months and loved it. When the SX50 came out, we were tempted, but skeptical about the faster auto focus and the additional zooming ability. We decided to give it a try. The verdict: Canon managed to noticeably improve on an already excellent product, and we bit the bullet and bought the new model.Here are our observations:General impression: the camera is light, has a nice grip, and takes amazing bird pictures even with free hands. The image quality further improves with the aid of a light tripod. When it comes to landscape pictures, the image is less ideal (less sharp) comparing to those taken by Canon S95, a compact camera we own. So our solution is to carry both cameras (both are so light) if we want to have excellent pictures for birding/wild life and landscape.Below is a direct comparison between SX50 and SX40:Auto focus: It really is much faster and more reliable than the SX40's. This is a big deal, particularly for taking pictures of birds.1200mm zoom: This sounds too good to be true for free-hand shooting with a compact camera and in a way it is. At some point cropping yields better results than zooming. So I was skeptical whether SX50's extra zooming ability would really add any value compared to the SX40. Some extensive testing revealed that the SX50 performs equally well as the SX40 at the same (840mm) zoom level. When zooming in further, there is some additional resolution (sharper image) compared to cropping. However, the added value is small and disappears in all but at the very best lighting conditions.Aperture: The aperture numbers are less than stellar: 3.4W-6.5T. Keep in mind though that at 1200mm poor aperture numbers are simply a fact of life. Also worth mentioning: At around 840mm, the aperture is the same as the SX40's, so no loss there. That being said, I would not recommend using this camera except for its amazing zooming ability. In the standard or wide angle range most any compact camera will deliver better results than the SX50.In summary, the SX50 is an amazing camera if used for the special purpose that it is good for. This includes birding, wild life photography, and anything else that really needs zooming in to the max. However, this is not an all-purpose camera. If your main need is to take amazing landscape pictures, other compact cameras would be a better option. (For higher quality images, we use Canon S95 or 5D depending on weight restrictions).Worth mentioning: Before we purchased our SX40, we also tested Nikon P510. SX40 outperformed P510 in auto focus (speed & reliability) and picture quality (sharpness).Useful accessories to greatly improve image quality:- Sirui T-1204X: ultra lightweight and super sturdy tripod, essential to keep the ISO low.SIRUI 4 Section Pro Carbon Fiber Tripod T1204x with Professional Travel Bag- Sirui G-10 ball head: lightweight and smooth. Total weight with the T-1204X is about 2.5lbSIRUI G-10 29mm Ballhead with Quick Release, 40 lbs Load Capacity- Canon remote switch: to avoid shaking caused by pushing the shutter release button.Canon Remote Switch RS60 E3 ANSWERNOTFOUND",have owned Canon 's prior model,"(139, 169)"

B009SYZ8OC,solid,How was the material?,"Not much can be said about cables (if they work), and this is one of them, I went through 2-3 generic cables (found out later that they were not Apple certified) before I found this, it has great length, &#34;IS&#34; Apple certified, and works like a charm. Great product by Amazon and definitely worth the money! Don't waste your time buying the cheap generic cables by other manufacturers, get this one and you are set.If only one thing I would change about this, then it would be the casing at the end of the cable (the iphone side), I would make it slimmer, it's kinda of big, so if you have a bigger case, then it won't fit right. But there is a simple solution to it ... I actually broke that plastic casing around the connector on the iphone side, and it works beautifully!

B0011NVMO8,slow,How is the auto focus?,"I am not a professional photographer, it is a hobby.  I had a telephoto zoom lens on an old Canon AT-1 film camera but I haven't used that camera in many years.  I was amazed at how close this telephoto lens got to the subject.  The day I got the lens I went to shoot a building in town for the webpage.  I put the EF-S 55-250mm lens on the camera and walked the three blocks to the building.  I could not get the building in the frame without crossing the street and introducing traffic and traffic lights into the picture.  I used  the kit lens (EF-S 18-55 mm) and got the shot.  I have used the lens at a Fly-In at the local airport.  I was able to zoom in as planes landed and you can see the pilot's faces as they were landing.  Also you could get great shots of the aircraft taking off and get several shots  after they were in the air.  The shots were always sharp no matter how far the subject was away from the camera.  I remember from the old AT-1 zoom, the further the object was away from the camera the more a tripod was needed.  Not with this lens.  The IS worked very nicely and every shot was sharp.  I would recommend this lens. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I was able to zoom in as planes landed and you can see the pilot 's faces as they were landing,"(638, 731)"

You will also have to pay for shipping from corsair if you don't fight it.Once I got one that was free of air, the install was easy and I think it looks better than a big bulky fan sitting on top of your mobo.  Performance seems on par with higher end fans but more quiet in my opinion.  Not sure if I would recommend though.  The cost isn't really justified especially with the headache of quality control issues. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the install was easy,"(334, 354)"
B00HPM1G8Q,removable,How is the keyboard?,"Edit 4/21/14. I finally caved and purchased a Fire HDX to use with this keyboard. Absolutely love it and the case. The case has openings for the on/off and volume buttons, as well as the camera lens. The Fire stays nicely propped on the pillow on my lap and the keyboard is very easy to use, with the added plus of less hands on the screen itself = less build up needing to be wiped off. Especially after buttered popcorn...That was something that I feared, having last year's model - nothing being marketed now fits my Fire. I was sure I studied the product page carefully prior to selecting it as a vine option, and I didn't see anywhere that said *Kindle HDs will not fit this case* (I do so appreciate those manufacturers who do that), so I decided to give this a go.OK, so bummer my Fire is too big to fit in the nifty little holder (pouts). But...the keyboard still works great, I just use it as a separate piece in my lap with the Fire on the other side. The keys are very easy to strike, as opposed to how hard I have to bang on the keys on the Acer laptop to make sure I don't miss letters and have to backtrack. That said, this doesn't quite replace the typing experience from a *real* keyboard and sitting at the desktop - but then I'm from the old school of proper typing on a proper typewriter (ya'll remember IBM Selectrics?). As nice as this keyboard is, you're just not going to get the speed you're used to and using the ASDF JKL; they used to teach in school - and definitely not trying to work the keyboard on your lap whilst trying to type with both hands like I was taught. Very handy for quick comments on FB or Goodreads, etc., I like it a lot more than the Fire virtual keyboard.As for setup and the too-brief instructions, I charged the keyboard but then felt completely lost on item #2 to turn on Bluetooth. Silly me, I didn't realize that was something I had to turn on on the Fire and not a switch on the keyboard that I couldn't find. Thank goodness for Google, which led me to a very helpful video that told me where to go to get that turned on. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the keyboard is very easy to use,"(258, 290)"
B000065BP9,crisp,How is the quality on the audio?,These things are amazing. The sound is absolutely mind blowing. Playing games wearing these really put you in the game. Music is crisp and clear and base can be felt in your bones. One of my favorite things about them though is that you really have no bleed out from the headphones. If you keep them at a moderate volume no one else can hear what you are listening to. They are very durable and I now own three pairs for various locations.

B006QB1RPY,easy to set,How did you like the router?,"This router is just plain awesome.  For years, I worked with a D-Link DIR-655 - which was fine, for the most part.  Once WiFi became more and more popular on different devices, however, I started to have problems - mostly with the amount of connections the old router could handle.  Since we now have 2 Tivo's, 2 Xbox 360s, an Apple TV, a Roku box, an iPad, 2 computers, a wireless printer and 2 iPhones (amongst other things) seeking out a WiFi signal, the old router just couldn't cut it.  I would have to shut the  WiFi off on one device in order to get another one to connect.  I started to notice slower overall performance and more frequent dropped connections.  The Apple TV seemed to NEVER be able to connect to my PC.  I figured it was an issue between an Apple world and my PC world, but it turns out - it was the router.The Asus Dark Knight router took care of ALL of my problems.  Last night, I had 13 devices connecting to the router simultaneously - and there wasn't a single hiccup.  I was able to stream HD video without any issue - and surfing the net was a breeze.Set-up is a snap - firmware updates are super easy to get through - and the thing ""just plain works"".  I have no complaints whatsoever.  I've only had this router for about a month or so, but I have yet to reset it for any reason (other than the firmware update).If you have MANY WiFi devices around that are constantly seeking signal - look no further than this router.

I debated between this one and another with a magnetic clasp closure.  I'm glad I chose this one because the magnetic clasp and closure would be very bulky and magnetics and electronics generally don't mix.She likes the look, the feel, the holding of it, the fact the covers flips back easily and a slim inside pocket for holding things (emergency cash, a business card, etc) and finally the elastic closure that wraps around the cover to keep it closed.The Kindle PaperWhite stays slim and fits into her purse and keeps it protected.Happy wife, happy life, so 5 stars from me! ;-) ANSWERNOTFOUND","She likes the look , the feel , the holding of it , the fact the covers flips back","(521, 600)"

B00752R9SM,good,How is that effect so good?,".We purchased this set after returning the disappointing Vizio M3D470KD  3D TV.We love this set. Here's why.The Picture:The picture was gorgeous, right out of the box. We had no need to tweak the default settings. The quality of the picture is truly astonishing.We may be part of that fringe group of viewers who love the SOE, ""soap opera effect."" We like our TV picture to be as lifelike and ""live"" as possible, so to watch a movie that appears like live TV is a treat. We see no reason to degrade the image so it looks like a movie. If my wife is watching TV I have to ask her if it is a movie or live because I can't tell by just looking at the screen.  Maybe SOE should be renamed LTVE, Live TV Effect. Love that LTVE effect!3D:The 3D is excellent. 3D really does add to the enjoyment of, well, anything. If you are wondering if 3D is worth the additional cost, the answer is YES. Provided you have a source for 3D programming.3D Glasses:The four included 3D glasses are well made. They are a different shape from the usual 3D glasses, which makes them more comfortable for prolong use, even over the eyeglasses which we both wear.The Remote:The remote is a good size, well-balanced with buttons intelligently sized and placed. For example, the mute button is just above the volume control buttons. The buttons are backlit for five seconds when a light button is pressed.The controls are easy and natural. The set is well designed ergonomically.One major annoyance in the Vizio TV was that you had to manually tell the TV that the image was in 3D, then tell it which type of 3D, then say yes, you really do want to view it in 3D before it would present the image in 3D. This Panasonic is smart enough to figure out the type of image, 3D or 2D, and then present it in that format without user intervention. The process is automatic. In both directions.Also, this TV does not get confused and freeze up when I am quick on the remote buttons as the Vizio did.Wi-Fi:I can't comment on the Wi-Fi since I don't use it on the TV, other than to say it successfully found my Wi-Fi channel and gave me access. I may use it in the future.Speakers:The speakers are adequate for us, providing clear speech and decent music. The TV is in a bedroom and sounds fine in that room. If you want movie theater sound you probably need an external speaker system.One negative is that the TV does not have an output jack for analog audio, such as a headphone. Only a digital audio jack.The manual:Panasonic does provide a printed (gasp) manual to use in assembling the base and setting up your TV. Detailed drawings of various possible connections are included. The TV is super easy to setup, essentially plugging it in and connecting to your TV source. That's it. The default picture needs no adjusting, but adjustments are available in you want to play around.  A 199 page manual is available online.  But you don't really need it.It was work to repack and return the Vizio TV using Amazon's free 30 day trial period (although Amazon was great, as usual, and credited us the full purchase price on the very next day after they received the return), but it did let us see how much better this Panasonic is and appreciate it so much more. I am actually grateful that we had problems with the Vizio else we might never have discovered this Panasonic.Packaging:The TV arrived in perfect condition, expertly packed with heavy tape holding the base safely away from the TV.Delivery:Amazon used Ceva for the delivery. Ceva lets you give them a time window for the delivery. We selected the 9:00 AM to noon window so we would be dressed and finished with breakfast before their arrival. However, they rang our doorbell at 8:00 AM, just as we sat down to breakfast. Inconvenient.The box was in perfect condition with no gouges or punctures.Repacking the TV in the box in the future if we need to will be a chore. I snapped several pictures as we unpacked the box so we can reverse the process if we ever need to. I saved printed copies of the pictures inside the box which we stored away.In conclusion:We have enjoyed this TV since July 16th. We like everything about it and obviously intend to keep it at the end of our 30 day trial. If anything happens that changes our minds, I will post an update. I will also post an update if I discover anything else that you should know about. ANSWERNOTFOUND",truly astonishing,"(244, 261)"
B00009XVCZ,negligible,How is the difference?,"After having used this lens for a few months and seeing the results it produces, it is easy to see why so many photographers wouldn't be without it.The build is very solid.  Ultrasonic motor and metal mount give the lens a very proffessional feel.  Granted, you can tell the difference between this lens and the much more expensive L version, but as far as picture quality goes, the difference is not so obvious.Bokeh you obtain with such a wide aperature is terrific for portraits, at aperatures from 1.4-2.0 there is some softness to the lens which gives portraits a bit of a ""dreamy"" look.  This is desired from many, but I don't particularly care for it.  Nevertheless, shots become extremely sharp after 2.0 and continue to improve to f 8.0.As far as whether you should purchase this particular lens or the less expensive 1.8 model, it really comes down to personal preference.  Budget is an important issue as you can get one for less than $90 and the other for around 330. The less expensive one has a plastic mount, which wont last as long, and it just feels less solid.  It also has a comparitavely loud and slower autofocus motor than the 1.4, and the focus ring is nearly non-existant.It took me a while to choose between the two, mainly because of the cost,  but finally decided on this one, I have not been dissapointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the difference is not so obvious,"(379, 411)"
B0074BW614,great,How is ease way?,"I got this as a gift a few months ago.  I have several non-Amazon ereaders.  This is my first Kindle ereader which is also a tablet.  Its very nice.  I was also given the case for it with the rapid charger.  The case is nice, protective and I can set it up to watch movies etc.The main thing that drives me crazy is the power on button.  They should have put it in an easier spot to get to and see.The other thing is also the lack of Google Play apps.  There are many on there I want that are not available.  Some other reviewer said there is a way to get them.  I have not tried figuring that out yet.Besides those two things I have no other complaints.  Obviously because it is a tablet the battery does go down faster if you are using it for other things than just reading.  Another thing to consider is it is heavy because of all the features it has.  So its not as easy to carry around or stick in a pocket or purse like a stand-alone ereader would do.  So that is something to consider.It has great functions and great picture quality.  It also has a camera and you can skype.  You can check your email, download available apps, play games, listen to music read,surf, etc.  There are many many other functions.As far as reading goes you can buy Amazon books right on the reader or online through your account or purchase gift cards available in most stores where the gift cards are; I see them everywhere.  However, I never buy books.  I read many books a month and get them all free through the Overdrive program including latest releases.  I downloaded the app on my Kindle Fire HD.  I can read Kindle format books and if I want to read non-Kindle format books I can read them on the ereader that is built into the Overdrive program, which is their console so I can read Kindle and Epub formats right on my Kindle Fire HD.  The ereader function of the Kindle Fire is very good.  The screen is bright, not much glare at all, tap to turn pages, easy dictionary access, bookmarking etc functions.  I also like how secure it is.  I have placed a password on it.  Its very easy to figure out and use.UPDATE:  I bought the ihome alarm/clock charger for this on Amazon.  See my review.  Its great. Its an alarm clock, charger (charges our KF and phones) and is a speaker for your KF for listening to music apps like Pandora, the FM radio the clock comes with etc. ANSWERNOTFOUND",So its not as easy to carry around or stick in a pocket or purse like a stand - alone ereader would do,"(856, 956)"
B007P4YAPK,sharp,How is the screen?,"I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire. All Honeycomb tablets had issues, they sooner or later had to go back due to defective manufacturing and software glitches. The iPad is a solid performer in the hardware and software aspect but is made for people that like to be told what to do and not do with their devices... Apple has a sick way of doing that and they always leave you wanting more when you know they could have provided all those things they intentionally left out so next year they can introduce it in their new iPad and have you go crazy for the new little feature that your old iPad should have included for the premium you paid.Then comes a solid company like Asus and comes up with a brilliant idea of making ""Transformer"" tablets, no tablet is perfect and Asus is no exception but the TF300 is everything I want a tablet to be with some room for improvement but not so much you'll cry about it because other have it and you dont. ICS is a very solid OS and has much good to offer. The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is ""optional"" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10"" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life. I use mine with a wireless USB mouse and it feels solid and reacts just as good as a good high performance notebook while performing many different task including watching HD movies. The combination of a touch screen and a ""real"" keyboard and mouse is a very awesome experience.The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it does have it's minor software glitches and the screen could have been better but all the pros overcome the cons very quickly and I would not change it for anything else at the moment.

B002SGATH8,comparable,How is the price?,"My wife uses this notebook cooler for a 14 inch laptop computer. It's been very reliable and comfortable thus far.Some thoughts:- The notebook cooler's build quality is superior! The material is so smooth and solid, and is very sturdy. I've noticed that the smooth texture of the cooler's base and many ventilated holes makes it harder for dust to collect. Several coolers I've owned and seen have had the problem of getting too dusty. Not a problem here.- The two fans give you the option to move them around, placing them wherever you'd like to place it. This is an ingenious feature because now you can move the fans to where you need it most. This is great, considering notebook cooler designs have always been stationary.- Overall good design. The angle and strength of the cooler is excellent and provides hours of comfort. Playing games, editing documents, surfing the internet, all computing tasks are comfortable with this cooler.- I like the idea of having this cooler also be a portable notebook carrier, but doesn't quite work well.

All the buttons and menu layout all are well designed and thought out enough, so that if you used a digital camera before, you don't have to read the manuel to figure out how to use all the functions.  I also like the fast start up time, the long battery life, and the various functions like video, continuous shooting mode etc...  None of these functions are unique to Cannon cameras though.  The color rendition is excellent.And this camera is pretty durable too.  I've carry one of these around often in my jean pocket.  The view screen did get scratched up a bit, but that's my fault for keeping coins and keys in the same pocket occasionally.What I didn't like about this camera is the quality of the pictures.  Even in good light you don't get really crisp and sharp pictures.  Perhaps I'm not being fair here.  The pictures from my Fuji2700 (only 2 mega pixels) look much crisper and sharper, but that camera is much bulkier with the bigger lens.  To be fair, I have not seen better pictures from any other super compact cameras in this class either.So, over all I would recommend this camera over any other comparable 6Mega pixel models in the same price range.  Just remember that it's great for taking snap shots and a bit more, but it's still a compact pocket camera with limitations.

Some of the sites are very slow to load. I was on the fence between Fire HD 7 and Galaxy Tab 2 7 with the choice went to Fire HD. The main reason for me was HDMI although I would also like micro SD support.Web surfing is better but still no comparison to my desktop.The screen is significantly better than the original Fire. Colors are more accurate and the dynamic range is much much larger. Pictures are now more natural looking with a gradual transition from dark to bright, much closer to my calibrated monitor.I am not bothered by the ads, actually not sure where the ads are. No access to Google play is not a big deal for me. I only have a few apps loaded and that's all I need.Finally, I decided to stay with 7"" size.

B00007E7JU,dramatic,What is the difference of iii to v?,"I understand I am comparing Fuji Apples to Gala Apples, but when I compare the image quality from this cheap, plastic-bodied prime lens to those from my several L-series Canon zooms, there is no contest: this lens outperforms. Now to those who say one cannot compare a prime to a zoom, I say: why not? Aren't we discussing image quality or are we discussing something else?Given the very large images produced by modern DSLRs, I can crop the image from this 50mm and get the zoom effect I need given the minimum zoom of 50mm (times crop factor). I can also place this lens on my Elan 7 film camera and get spectacular results. I use this lens more and more and zoom using my physical zoom (feet) and digital zoom (Photoshop or Aperture or any image editing software). The results are always great. No, I cannot print to 40x60 inches if I crop from this lens, but I am not planning to do that anyway.When I shoot a wedding (not bridal portraits, I use the 85mm prime for that) the photos made using this lens are always the best and always the favorites. I know it does not have the little red ring around it but that is just to show other photographers that you are hip and with it, not necessarily to get better images and certainly not based on the money-to-image-quality ratio. Nope, buying a more expensive camera or a more expensive lens will NOT make you a better photographer. Using a prime lens, however, like this very affordable option, will certainly improve your images.The cons are obvious: low build quality. This means that the lens is likely to last for only ten years or so, judging by the fact that other Canon primes (and all Canon lenses in general) are notoriously and incredibly reliable (the more expensive f/1.4 version of this lens a notable exception, but still very, very, very reliable).The sum of all my comments is but this: for the money, there is no finer nor more useful lens for your Canon EOS Camera.

B003ELYQGG,better,How would you rate the designs for the new house?,"These are some cool little ear buds.  The bud part is oval shaped (after being inserted onto the post, otherwise the silicone buds do look round in the package) instead of perfectly round and they seem to fit in my ear better than any other buds I have tried.  I have VERY small ears so I have a difficult time finding earbuds that are comfortable, and these fit the bill.  The in ear part is also slightly off center so they seem to block noise better and have a more secure fit.  I have shaken my head around quite a bit with these in and they refuse to fall out.  Other buds have not been so kind to me.  The sound is acceptable, and for the price you seriously cannot go wrong.  They come with three different sized in ear pieces.  They are a little more difficult to swap out due to the shape of the bud post being oval and the bud itself being round, but it isn't that big of a deal. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The sound is acceptable,"(608, 631)"
B005FDXMJS,poor,What did you think of the modem signal?,I always like to buy Cisco products if the prices are right. This item does take a little away from speed but not even noticeable if you are on a faster network. It certainly works as described and fairly simple to set up. I had a little trouble the first time I tried and had to reset to clear the settings I put in but once it was reset I was able to go in and successfully set it up no problem. Now I have almost full signal all through my house and a good ways around it too instead of the front two rooms that I got with the stock wireless router. Bought this in the past and would certainly purchase again. ANSWERNOTFOUND,I have almost full signal,"(402, 427)"
B0099SMFVQ,lightweight,Does the keyboard lightweight?,"This keyboard is nice and light but doesn't feel flimsy. I felt comfortable off the bat and started right away on my homework with ease. I paired so easily and quickly with my iPad 2.Typing is smooth and there is click to the keys that are not intrusive. Typing in the dark is nice and now I don't have to worry about disturbing my sleeping husband with bright lamps on while studying late at night.Having the other function keys on this keyboard are so useful.If I stop typing, the light on the keyboard dims after about 15 seconds. But after I move my fingers or depress a key, it lights back up again and with no lag at all. I walked away for about 5 minutes and came right back with no lag or delay as well.I was looking for a portable keyboard for my iPad 2 and having the quality of this brand plus the backlit keys were a plus. Too bad there isn't some sort of hard shelled carrying case for this, so for now, I'm not going to just throw it into my bookbag.I also opted for the retractable auto charger, retractable home travel charger, and the Fellowes 9184901 Laptop Palm Support.

B004NY9UV4,thick,How thick is the material of the bag?,"I love Case Logic products, I have several different items they make, and this one is very nice as well.I purchased this to protect my Samsung Series 7 Slate PC and it does a great job.  The material it is made from is soft and thick enough to protect the slate from inadvertent pokes and bumps.The one negative aspect (and maybe with use it will stretch a bit) is that the zippered opening is about 1/16th of an inch (or about 1.5mm) too small.  I have to be very careful not to accidentally hit the power button when putting it inside (certainly the slate will turn off in a few minutes, but it will be hotter than heck by the time it does) and it take a bit more force to coax the slate out when I want it.I do not believe it is water-proof, however, I have run from the car in the rain with it, and it did not soak through. I was in the rain for about 10 seconds and it was not a deluge, so I would not assume that your contents would survive unscathed from something more than a few splashes of water, but usually that is all should be allowed to hit anything holding electronics anyhow.If the opening stretches with time, I will update this review (and probably raise the stars), but for now it offers good protection for my slate PC.

B001UQ6F4S,big,Do you have a big problem?,"I kept this unit for about a week before deciding to return it. It is not terrible at all, but a couple items were real dealbreakers for me:1) Low volume level on DVD and Blu-Ray playbackThis must be something specific to LG. I have an LG DVR (LRM-519) that is a few years old and it has the exact same problem. When I play Blu-Ray discs or regular DVDs, I have to turn the volume on my TV or Sony AV Receiver way, way up just to hear the movie at a normal level. I was watching Baby Mama and had to crank my Receiver up to the max volume just to hear it. It is connected with an optical cable, but I have the same issue with the volume through the TV which is connected using HDMI. I previously had my Xbox 360 connected to my AV Receiver and DVDs sounded amazing. I didn't have to turn up the receiver past 45 to get it really booming. With the LG BD 370, I had to crank it at 70 (max).2) The player uses the same remote IR commands as my LG DVRVery few other people will probably run into this problem, but the BD 370 happens to use the same remote control commands as my existing LG DVR. So, for example, when I turn on the BD 370, the DVR also turns on. When I press the Open/Close button on the remote, the DVD tray on both my DVR and Blu-Ray player open. When I press Menu on the remote, it brings up the menu on my DVR and my blu-ray player. This was just an annoyance at first until I realized that watching netflix or a bluray disc on the BD 370 could actually cause me to stop something from recording on my DVR due to the random command being sent to the DVR as I control the blu-ray player.3) Netflix only shows Instant QueueI admit, this is a very minor gripe, but I really got spoiled by the Netflix experience on my Xbox 360. On the xbox 360, the netflix menu shows not only the movies you have added to your instant queue, but also lets you browse a selection of shows/movies in other categories. I have found that I use that feature a lot. So I was pretty disappointed to see that it isn't replicated on the BD 370. However, the quality of the streaming on the BD 370 was every bit as good as on the Xbox 360. Also, I had zero problems connecting to netflix when I hooked up the player. I just connected the player to my router with an ethernet cable and it had no problem getting on netflix.Pro - The ability to watch Youtube on the BD 370 was cool, especially because it allowed me to log into my Youtube account and access my favorites. However, that was not enough to make me want to keep the player.All in all, if you don't mind the low volume level and you don't have any other LG DVD players or DVRs connected to the same TV as the BD 370, it is a pretty decent unit. ANSWERNOTFOUND",but I have the same issue with the volume through the TV which is connected using HDMI,"(595, 681)"

B0075SUK14,awesome,How was the zoom?,"I received my SX260 last Wednesday and have taken about 700 shots and a few quick 5 minute video. Without writing a novel, here are the high/low points of this unit. In addition to this unit, I also purchased a couple of aftermarket batteries (and after market A/C adapters for about $5.00 each) for about $5.00 each and the batteries work fine. With the battery (original and aftermarket) I was able to get over 300 shots (50% flash) with zooming and playback and the battery meter still showed about 25% charge remaining.Pro'sZoom - very long for a subcompact camera 20x optical, total 81x combined (yes 81 times!)Image Stabilizer - Excellent (far superior than the DSC-HX9V); Even at 81x the picture did not come out of focus, but of course not as sharp. I think it's still acceptableScenes - A few scenes; I think the portrait, sepia, B/W works real well (the Portrait+ suppose to blur the picture a bit, but it's not to my liking) It has a few effects (fish eye, toy, miniature) that's very effective and can be fun for creative shots.Auto Mode - was able to pick the correct type of scene almost all the time; it has an easy mode, and smart auto. Not sure why they have an easy mode, but the smart auto works greatSize/Weight - very compact and weigh's 8.2 oz. I would have prefer if the lens was flushed with the unit, but at 20x it may not have been possibleUniformity - the unit does not feel cheap, and beautifully curved; no sharp jagged cornersGrip - the right side of the camera has a nice plastic strip for easier gripControls - Dial extremely easy to use with one hand. The other buttons, if you're a previous Canon user, it's a no brainer; the menu and setup are practically the same across all their models.Screen - 3 inch TFT LCD screen very beautiful; nuff saidProcessor - Didn't notice that much difference between the DIGIC 4/DIGIC 5, but compared to the DSC-HX9V, this camera is like a Ferrari.GPS - Camera has it, but I never used it and probably won't; at least for the time being. Am more interested in a camera that takes excellent pictureCon'sVideo - compared to the Sony DSC-HX9V this Canon comes in a distant second; if you plan on using this primarily as a video recorder, look elsewhere. I think Sony has excellent lens on their camera but their processing technology is clumsy, painfully slow and unacceptable; whereas with taking videos, the Sony does not do any processing (not to mention it captures at 60fps compared to Canon's 24/25 fps) This is one thing I will miss dearly.Flash - not sure if there is a good place but I had to change my grip as the flash is on the top left corner. Couple of times, I had my left index finger on the flash and the camera gave some flash error message and had to power off and power on the camera to reset the flash.If you're a casual or intermittent photographer (or a professional wanting an everyday point and shoot camera without carrying a luggage everywhere) that is interested in looking for a well refined point and shoot camera, yet has manual controls usually found on higher end DSLR (or higher end point and shoot camera), this is it!UPDATE 04/14/2012 - I paid $349 and today I noticed it's selling for $299, a 15% price drop in less than a month! I thought cars depreciate quick ...UPDATE 04/18/2012 - The Live Mode works great! For those hard shots (for example, taking indoor picture with fluorescent lighting and without a flash), you can view the screen and make the adjustment right then and there. You look at what you plan to take, compare it to the SX260 LCD screen and press the shutter button. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Pro'sZoom - very long for a subcompact,"(523, 561)"
B004PGMFG2,sensitive,How is the touch screen?,"This tablet has exceeded my expectations.  The screen is very bright and vibrant, its processor is very fast.  Video playback is excellent.  I find myself using this tablet for everything from surfing the web to creation of documents.  Another plus point is that is has Android ICS on it, which in my opinion is way better than the previous versions.  I like the metallic styling, seems more durable than the plastic casings most tablets have.  The touchscreen is very responsive &  quick.  The battery life is excellent, I can use it almost all day with a full charge, this include watching lots of videos.  I don't care too much for the camera on it,  it's lacking, but I dind't buy the tablet because of the camera so it's not a big disadvantage for me.

B005HMKKH4,other,Who is the driver?,"///Update: 26Oct2012///After some Googling, I found that it is a common issue with WD that you cannot view two or more HD's plugged in. There are several fixes, but the most common and reliable way is to go to your Computer Management (Windows) and click the unrecognized drive ""online"". You can then assign it a different Drive Letter which will then allow you to see it every time you plug it in. Without going into too much details, basically WD assigned the same signature to the drives that is why it is showing up as one drive at a time. As a result, I moved the rating up to 5 stars. Enjoy!///Original: 12Oct2012///I love how small it still is (compared to a regular 1TB). When I travel I try to maximize my contents without compromising the weight and space taken. I often have to travel in just a backpack for several days so having the drive is perfect for having my digital movies and tv because it does not require an adapter for power (just USB) and it does not take up so much room. Because of the amount of files I own, I ended up buying 3 of these (only needed 2, but didn't realize I previously bought one already).I do however have some issues with it. Unfortunately, laptops cannot recognize two of the same type of drive. So if you were to transfer files from one drive to the next, you much use a median to temporarily store your data first (ie. laptop itself or a non-WD 2TB Passport Drive).Other than that, I am quite satisfied. Data transfer with USB 3.0 is noticeably superior to USB 2.0. In comparison to cheaper drives with USB 3.0 (not to cause blame on other drives), this performed data transfer faster and more consistently. I have used mine for some time now and through my travels overseas and it is still going strong even with the climate changes (extreme hot in the desert and snowing winter).Bottom line, a must have item for large media files during any time of travels due to its capacity, portability, and size. Just don't expect to be able to plug two at one time to your laptop and see both of them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",unrecognized drive,"(259, 277)"

B004J3ZV62,poor,How is the image quality like?,"The Canon 300HS an excellent camera as long as you accept that it's not a ""baby S95."" If you want fast access to manual controls, this is not the camera for you. If you like scrutinizing the image pixel by pixel, this is not the camera for you. However, someone who's a non-photographer and wants good-looking photos from a small camera in ""Auto"" mode will almost definitely love it.Likes:--------------1) Image quality is good for a camera in this price range. Yes, there is some mild corner softness at 100% magnification, and there are some chromatic aberrations in high contrast areas, but looking at the whole photo at any reasonable magnification, I'd be hard pressed to criticize the quality. The noise is well controlled, and there is enough fine detail to avoid the dreaded ""water color painting"" effect of some other popular cameras. Auto white balance does a good job under a variety of lighting, exposure is generally spot-on, and low-light images are better than I expected. ISO 1600 is usable for small prints in low light.2) Video quality is very good. It uses a high bitrate compression, which eats memory fast, but I can see details in the video that other cameras simply smudge over. My only complaint is that the 1080p video is recorded at 24fps, and is somewhat choppy in motion. Switching to 720p or lower resolution results in 30fps video, which produces noticeably smoother motion. The stereo sound quality is decent, and the mics are plenty sensitive. When zooming during video recording, there is some motor buzz that's picked up by the mics, but it's only noticeable in a quiet environment.3) I like the 24mm wide angle lens, and prefer that over some 100x mega-zoom. It lends itself well to landscape shots, interior shots, close-ups, and other creative photography scenes.4) The camera is pretty quick to power on, and the controls have good response. It focuses in under 1 second, there is minimal shutter lag, and shot-to-shot times are about 2 seconds.5) The controls are intuitive, well-organized, and the buttons are plenty big for such a small camera. I had most functions figured out in a few minutes without having to resort to the manual. The mode switch provides a convenient thumb rest when holding the camera.6) Construction and build quality seems solid. I bought mine at a local store and made sure to get the version made in Japan. I haven't observed the problems mentioned by other reviews, like shaky video zoom or easily scratched finish. The battery door seems somewhat fragile, though.Dislikes:--------------1) When completely zoomed out, the lens casts a shadow from the flash in the lower right corner.2) Video mode is mostly automatic, you can't even adjust exposure compensation. I have older compact cameras which can do this, it would have been nice to have that feature here.3) The quick-set menu is somewhat slow to operate because it does not present as much information at once as other cameras, for example Panasonic's Q-menu. It's a vertical layout with vertical submenus, whereas a horizontal layout with vertical submenus would have been better.4) There is no wind-cut option for the microphones.I'm not taking points off because these are relatively minor issues, considering the camera is aimed at a novice user. It's not perfect by any means, and it's missing some toys found in other cameras, like a high resolution screen, auto HDR, or auto-stitching panorama. However, if your priority is the end result - the quality of images or video coming out of the camera - this one stands above the competition. I would recommend it to anyone looking to produce good-looking photos with minimal fuss. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Image quality is good,"(406, 427)"
B00752R9SM,great,How is the 3d rendering?,"I've been a fan of Samsung for years and this is the first time I've strayed from my usual brand. When comparing the features on this TV to a similar Samsung you will pay $300-$400 more. I wasn't sure what to expect with this TV and honestly I was ready to dislike it from the start. Now that I've been using mine for about a month I feel I can give a solid review. Sure, this TV is not top of the line, but it has some features you will find on much higher priced sets.Pros- This TV is thin! You can hang it on the wall and it looks like a picture frame on the wall. All the connections are strategically placed that make doing just this possible!- Built in WiFi! I've always hated the idea of having to run a network cable to where I have my TV. It just isn't practical. My PS3 and Xbox are wireless so that's how I've compensated over the past few years. Having the ability to stream without an external source directly from Netfilx or Amazon has made this TV really handy.- The passive 3D has been amazing! I thought I really wanted a TV with active 3D, but the wider viewing angle of the passive 3D and not having to worry about battery powered glasses was a big selling point for me to go passive. Sure the TV snobs will tell you that you are not seeing each frame in Full 1080P with the passive, but we've gotten to the point where the human eye can't even tell so I'm not paying more for something I wouldn't even notice! The 2D to 3D feature is pretty cool too, but the way I'd describe that is that instead of the picture coming out at you, the TV seems to be like a window that you are looking into. The true 3D does come right out of the set at you and I can't believe there isn't more 3D content for how amazing it is to have in your home. The nice thing about the passive 3D is that you just take home your glasses from the latest 3D movie in the theater and they work with your set!- The sound has been impressive. Sure it's not amazing, but I have heard much worse from stock TV speakers. I did hook mine up to surround sound but still use the TV speakers 80% of the time and they have done just fine.Cons:- I'm not sure but I believe this TV only has a single core processor. It's most obvious when searching through the smart TV menus. It just seems like the TV needs more processing power to truly be used as a smart TV that could replace your computer for surfing the web. I've added a wireless logitech keyboard and it has made the smart TV functions so much easier to use! Trying to key in a basic internet search with the stock remote is just down right painful!- Soap Opera Effect (SOE). I've heard many people talk about SOE and Panasonic TVs and didn't understand until I've seen it regularly. It's hard to explain, but some TV shows like Dramas actually look more realistic then they are probably meant to, so they look a lot like the camera movements you would see watching a soap opera. While I've listed this as a Con, it's actually started to grow on me.- No built in camera. The TV has Skype as one of the apps, but without an external camera you can't even use it to make calls. The camera is required to use the app which I don't fully understand. I can make skype calls on my computer without turning the camera on, why can't I do the same on my TV?- The power indicator light is in a horrible location. It is a bright red LED right in the center on the bottom. In a dark room it is so obvious, I don't know why they placed this where they did, but I have noticed I've started blocking it out. At first it was a major annoyance and I almost covered it up with a small piece of tape!I don't think you can find a TV with more features for this price and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would consider a Panasonic in the future if I am ever looking to upgrade again.Update 11/24/12It truly is a 120 HZ refresh rate set and they get to 360 HZ by playing with the backlighting from what I understand.  In comparing to other sets I would compare this to other 120 HZ sets.  I am not aware how many bits the panel is and I have tried to ind this info without any luck.  I personally have had zero issue with any edge light bleeding.  The edge of my set is perfectly uniform and with the room dark and a dark scene there is no bleed through.  I honestly didn't want to like this set as my fianc&eacute;e picked it as an engagement gift for me and I was looking at samsungs that cost much more.  5 months later we still both love the set and the only thing I wish is that we would have gone bigger than the 42"".  We were even considering upgrading to the 55"" when it was in the Black Friday deal a couple nights ago but I didn't pull the trigger.  Hope this helps!

B0088CJT4U,easy,How is the configuration?,"I had my internet up and running with this router in minutes. It was not simply plug and play, but I believe that is par for the course with cable internet service. I plugged all the cables in, and there was no internet connection. I simply then went through the guided setup available through the router's administration portal and I was all set. We noticed a big difference with our wireless network speed and reach after hooking this router up. Previously, we had trouble streaming high quality videos on our iPads from the other side of the house. After setting this router up, we have no problems. This could be due our old router being just old and slow. But I also used the dual-band feature, and have our iPads connected to the 5 ghz network. I think that we noticed the improvement because we are getting less interference from cell phones and baby monitors. We also have the 2.4 GHZ network running for devices that are not 5 GHZ capable (my cell phone, for example). Altogether, I'm very pleased with this router and would recommend to others.

B00001P4ZH,not strong,Is this music song have a goo bass?,"To anyone who hasn't tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the ""comfort zone"" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.

B00BGGDVOO,responsive,How is control?,"I was apprehensive about buying this till I talked with a trusted friend who had one.  She said it was great and could be transferred from TV to TV in the house. (must stay within com distance of your Wi-Fi device).The Roku 3, which is the model I purchased, requires HMDI cable to the TV and Wi-Fi connection OR Ethernet (Cat 5) cable to the Internet.Once connected there were just a few very easy on-screen prompts to connect and sign-on to the Roku.ONE VERY IMPORTANT CONNECTION STEP: In my research of the Roku I kept seeing the same step emphasized to connect the Roku.  You're TV should have several &#34;source&#34; connections (where the source program inters the TV).  The remote control should have a &#34;source&#34; selector.  If you don't go to the correct &#34;source&#34; input you will not see the Roku input.  READ AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT COME WITH THE ROKU.  The included instructions for mine were very easy to understand.Most programming received through the Roku is subscription based, or &#34;Pay Per View&#34;, with a couple of exceptions, like UTube.  I am a NetFlix subscriber so I just added &#34;ON-DEMAND&#34; services for a few extra dollars a month.Roku 3 has a very small remote control.  It's very easy, comes with ear buds to plug into the remote for private listening, and the remote works on Radio Frequencies instead of Infra-Red to communicate with the Roku.  This means that the remote does NOT have to have an unobstructed line-of-sight to the Roku.It sounds like, from what I've read, some of the earlier models are very good also.  So, if you are counting penny's you might consider them.  Some have different connection requirements/abilities.BOTTOM LINE: I would recommend this device to my friends.

B003DZ165W,hard,Is the cover hard?,"I have really been enjoying my lighted cover for my Kindle. Before I bought it, I read some other reviewers that suggested using the elastic band to bind back the cover when reading. As in, open the cover all the way until it touches the back cover and flip the band around it to hold it there. This works great. The cover is nice and stiff which seems to provide good protection. The light, for me, works really great. It is really convenient not having to have a separate light and/or batteries. Some reviewers have complained about the included LED light being unevenly distributed. This is true, but mine doesn't seem to be in any way that bad. I played with the light (it slides out on a molded flat plastic arm in the top right hand corner of the back), and see that if the light is angled just a little bit more down or up it changes the light distribution considerably. Which leads me to wonder if the lights that are giving the most problems are just off-angled. Anyway, it is just a thought.

B0074BW614,good,How was the customer support?,"AWESOME, INCREDIBLE, Any other positive you can think of.  I have been thinking about getting a tablet for each of my daughters and have been reading reviews and checking out every device I can get my hands on.  I know I didn't want the el-cheepo tablets you can get for $99.  I've seen those and checked them out and they are tablets, but generally have older operating system, lack support, and don't support all the apps.  I didn't want a limited device.  I also didn't want to spend $350 per device either.  I have heard of people that got the Kindles and were very happy with them so I decided to take a chance and get 2 of them.  For the price of the refurb devices, with a percentage off e-coupon that I had, plus using my amazon points from my Amazon credit card, I was able to basically get 2 of these for the price of one.  I set my expectations a bit low because I didn't think of them as full tablets, but I'm happy to report I was rather wrong in that area.  I was very, very impressed with the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  I have a full 10 inch Acer Iconia tablet that I like and my kids like but it's a bit large for them.  This is the perfect size and feels so good in the hands.  The screen is very clear, and the sound these things produce is just amazing.  I couldn't believe how amazing the sound on these is, and how loud!  My kids are getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to see their jaws hit the ground!  Amazon uses a custom interface for the Android OS, but it doesn't make it any less functional. It is a bit different getting used to compared with the standard Android interface, but it works fine.  It was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with it.  Once you get used to the different interface, it's just as easy to get around in it as anything else, and if it's your first exposure to the world of tablet devices, I think it would be much easier to learn and get comfortable with.  I can't be happier with these things and actually, even though I have a 10 inch tablet, I'm very much considering getting one of these for me too.  I like it that much.Now, as for the refurbished part, don't be afraid of that word.  I get refurb stuff all the time and so far, here's what my experience is... they are great!  It seems like the refurb items have had all the bugs worked out and have had more rigorous testing than the new devices.  I've had plenty of new things stop working on me and had to get them replaced or repaired, but I've never had one single refurb device have any issue at all... ever (knock on wood!!).  These had no signs of ever having been used.  Not one single scratch or blemish, and Amazon's support is growing to be legend.  They want people to be happy with their purchases and will go the extra mile to ensure you are, so the support they offer is very good.I guess the bottom line is, if you are looking to get a tablet to start into the tablet world, or want something for the kids, then you have to consider this.  The price is excellent and it's a great tablet.  You won't be dissapointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND",INCREDIBLE,"(9, 19)"

I tested the touch screen using more than one test app and I found no issues.... also I didn't encounter any touch screen issues while using the device. I do have both android as well as Apple devices so I am not biased to anyone against the other... and to be honest, I was planning to buy the ipad mini with Retina display, but I didnt like its width and I HATED ITS PRICE !!!! so I bought this Nexus for less than half the price of the ipad mini (my 32G  Nexus 7 is $229 no Tax and no shipping while the 32G ipad mini is $550 including the Tax). I do believe that the ipad is more stable, more mature, looks nicer, and will out-perform this Nexus, but honestly for half the price I highly recommend this Nexus 7 .... I like this device: display is beautiful, performance is good (I updated to 4.4), and battery life is excellent.I am giving 4 starts because I believe that Asus should have done a little better job by reducing the huge top/bottom bezel or at least provide capacitive buttons and probably front speakers on this huge bezel in case if they decided to keep its size as is...I will update this review in case if I encounter any issues....

B0030MITDK,fantastic,Do you know film a video?,"Okay we all know this isn't a replacement for a full blown camcorder and certainly not a camera, BUT it is a great product. I personally bought it for it's waterproof capabilities. It takes a DECENT still shot, more than good enough for social networks or emails. More importantly though, the video that it shoots is outstanding. Better than most I've had experience with taken by cameras, plus it's waterproof. I have mentioned that a couple of times now because I feel that is the key aspect with this product.This is a fun camera and small enough to throw in a pocket. Getting to the details on video I have to say that outdoors is where it shines. Indoor shots with normal lighting are also good but low light are viewable but somewhat grainy. Underwater video is equally good. You MUST turn that mode on. Each time the camera is turned off it resets and must be turned on again. It just compensates for the lighting underwater. I've forgotten to turn it on and the video looks good? The digital zoom is remarkably good. Usually digital zoom tends to be less than ideal but this camcorder handles it very well! Much better than expected. I don't hesitate to use it at all, even on full zoom it's good. The manual does not say what the zoom is nor does the camera. People here in the reviews have estimated and I'd GUESS 4-5x.As for the video modes 720p 30fps isn't bad. The picture is sharp and has great color. There can be some shakey almost slightly strobe light effect if you move the camera too fast. The built in image stabilization does help BUT you must turn it on. 720p 60fps is the bomb! I think this is the sweet spot and use this mode most of the time. 1080p 30fps is wonderful though you must again be careful with the camera movement. The image is just plain crisp!! Don't get me wrong this mode is great but it takes a lot of memory and isn't really practical for emailing or uploading to social networks. Looks beautiful on my 58 in. Samsung plasma.Stills as I said are good and a couple outdoor shots I took rival my better camera. Parties, walks on the beach, hanging with friends are good venues for the stills. Important parties, weddings, those moments that really mean something, no, use a dedicated real camera.Battery life is pretty decent. I shoot 30 sec. to 1 min. most of the time then power off and it has lasted through 2 serious parties 40-50 vids at each party with time to spare. Not sure if you just turned it on and let it go for like 5-10 min. vids? My guess is that it wouldn't last as long. That's the WORST way to take vids anyway!! Nothing is worse than a 5 minute or longer video to watch!! OMG, please don't ever force a vid of that length on a friend. Because you can't say anything and have to sit through the whole horrid thing. Show the same vid in 1 min or less clips and it's acceptable. Just my opinion.This has been a great purchase for me. As said the waterproof capability is what sold me. If you don't want to lug the camcorder and camera along this just pops in the pocket. It's inexpensive and FUN, buy it you won't regret itP.S.

B001V9LPT4,reasonable,Is quality good?,"These caught my eye when shopping for new buds because of the Android control. While the control capabilities is nice (in theory), the sound quality, durability, and actual ability to control playback makes me happy I bought these well below retail price.As far as sound quality, I would place these in the realm of $20-$30 Skullcandy earbuds. They produce absolutely no bass with any music, and podcasts sound extremely tinny. The drivers are so light that I realized out of the box these would not impress. I have used higher priced Klipsch before, and these had none of the full sound previous pairs had. I am currently using Bose IE2 earbuds as well, and moving back and forth from the Bose to these it surprises me how much cleaner the Bose sound.The build quality is also lacking. I would qualify the build as better than cheap Skullcandy earbuds, but I expect these to shred apart in less than 6 months after careful use. The shielding around the wires is thin, and the connection point to the buds feel like they will either loosen too much or the shielding will wear away at the bud contact points. The ""remote"" portion is not as solidly built as can be, but the one control button has a good click to it. Overall a cheap feel.The actual fit is not bad at all. There are multiple tips, so one is bound to fit properly, and they do a decent job of isolating sound from a tight seal in the ear.The actual control of an Android phone (Droid Incredible 2) is spotty. The app to fully utilize these has a decent amount of setup options for only having one button to use. Sometimes the earbuds control spot on, sometimes I accidentally hang up on a phone call by mistake. There seems to be noticeable lag or non-responsiveness with button presses at times, and was verified to work the in the same spotty nature on a Galaxy Nexus as well.

So this review will have a pros and cons that considers the four &#34;tv boxes&#34; versus each other.ApplePros: smooth operations as far as the software goes (best  i have used), works great with all apple productsCons: software is smooth because apple limits the developers by only allowing certain looks and interactions, doesn't work with some other branded products, very limited apps. limited processor versus some of the others.Roku 3Pros: great overall box, largest number of apps (channels), smooth operations.Cons: no real cons except the slower processor (doesn't have a huge effect now but may in the future)ChromecastPros: Cost (cheapest of the four), easy install, size (smallest), cost, cost, costCons: need a computer or ipad/iphone/tablet or some other type of controller to operate, wifi reception is a little weak, buffers more than the others, has limited number of apps, has a limited processor.Amazon FireTvPros: best processor, with newest firmware as of may 29 2014 is very smooth, rapid growing number of apps, the voice search is nice and has improved.Cons: not many, i love this guy and will probably buy another one.conclusion: the roku is a great box, it works great and has the most channels.

B003UE52ME,cool,What do you think of the artistic design?,"I ordered this product on Jan 2, 2012 from Amazon. My first impressions upon taking it out of the box were that it looked different than the pictures shown. After comparing it to the product pictures I confirmed that what I ordered was a slightly different unit than what is shown. I have posted a picture so that you can see what is different in the one I ordered compared to the original product picture & the pictures of other owners. Specifically: The USB dongle is full size, not a mini like in others pictured. The buttons below the touch pad are completely different than other pictured models. Keys are also flat & clear glossy finger print magnet plastic material, not convex matte finish like seen in other models pictured.After trying this product out for a little over 20 mins navigating the internet and doing some video playback my first impressions are that I should have invested in another (but full size) keyboard. The biggest problem I have with this product is that it will go into some sort of sleep mode (I assume to conserve battery life) which takes about 10 seconds before it will reconnect with the computer and start showing the mouse swipes & keyboard inputs. This was very frustrating while surfing the net & watching YouTube videos. I have no idea the length of time before it would power down the signal but just to give you an idea this would happen after watching a 2 min YouTube video.At first I thought it was neat how small the keyboard was but after trying to type on it I've grown frustrated with typing on the thing. Having been raised knowing how to type on the keyboard I find myself being frustrated going from 70+ wpm on the computer down to about 10 wpm because of design of this particular keyboard. The keys are grid shaped, not offset like a normal keyboard and because of the touch pad on the right it's not as easy to type on as say an Iphone because you'r right thumb has to reach considerably further to hit any of the keys. So if you're thinking that you text fast & this wouldn't be a problem consider the inch of dead space between your thumb & the keys.Lastly, & probably the most important is signal quality. I purchased this with intentions of using it for an HTPC. Sitting about 10 ft away from the computer I found that it drops keystrokes about every 5th input. The trackpad is also something highly left to be desired. I first used this on my gaming machine that I sit about 2 ft away from and noticed a slight laggy input when using the trackpad. I was a little leery that the signal was that bad sitting so close to the input but I decided to still give it a chance and plugged it into my HTPC. Increasing the distance between the USB dongle & the keyboard only increases the lag of using the trackpad.So in review: 1 star was taken off for not receiving exactly what I was shown in the product pictures. 1 star was taken off for the poor signal quality of this item even at close ranges, and 1 star is taken off for the lack of distance this allows you to have between the PC and the keyboard (in the product description it states this works within 30M which I assume they mean 30 meters. Unfortunately in a 12x12 room with nothing between me and the PC I was having signals cut out constantly. This room also has no wireless internet connection & no wireless phones).

B0043T7FXE,nice,How is the button?,"The M570 improves on the older Logitech Wireless Trackball in a number of ways. The USB transceiver is now a micro sized unit and is ""Unified"" so it can work with other ""Unified"" Logitech wireless devices as well. The trackball now has additional ""back/forward"" buttons although they are located in an odd location that requires you to use your index fingers. Admittedly, I am used to using my thumb for those buttons on a mouse but there's nowhere to place them with the big trackball in the way. The ball is also very tight and does not spin as freely as the original wireless trackball. It almost feels ""gritty"". The battery life is superb with a single NiMH AA, although the original trackball had excellent battery life as well. If you suffer from CTS, get a wireless trackball.

The one complaint I have above in the cons is that it can be difficult to open up the case because the iPad tends to flip backwards instead of the whole top flipping back.

B0027VT6V4,better,How is speaker?,"I searched around on Amazon for quite a while and looked up reviews on several speakers all across the internet before finally making this purchase.  I had a set of Bose Companion 2 speakers, and they were nice, but I constantly felt the lack of a subwoofer was leaving me wanting more bass.  These speakers sound decent, but the speakers themselves have absolutely NO bass in them at all.  Thankfully, there is a subwoofer with this set.  On the control knob, you can adjust the speaker volume, the bass level, and there is a headphone jack and auxillery jack.  The speakers are pretty thin so they don't take up much space on my desk.  I have the subwoofer under my desk and so far everything seems to be working out okay.  They get up to a decent volume also.  If you are looking to not spend very much money, these will do the job for you.  If you are looking for absolutely awesome speakers, look elsewhere.

B005HMO6A6,adjustable,What should be done with the stands?,"This is my review for the New Trent Airbender 1.0 (NT38B).  I received this product and right off the bat I liked the packaging and the helpful instructions inside.  After having a chance to use It I was blown away.  It has sturdy construction and the battery life on the keyboard is very nice.  Not to mention rechargeable.  In other products you would have to lug around a keyboard and a case if you wanted something to protect your device and be able to be productive.  With this case it is all in one.  I liked the adjustability of the orientations that the pad could be put in it helps when doing different tasks.  I also liked the adjustability because there are sometimes depending on light and other factors when you need the Ipad to be at a certain angle.I have in the past had a case that did well with protecting it, and had a stand but it was two pieces and the stand was not very adjustable.  I would have to use other small items to prop the screen up further.I also believe this case provides decent protection to my device, although I am not sure I would want to drop it in this case as I think the case would not fully protect it.  But for every day usage I believe that it would hold up.I like the look and feel of the keyboard the layout is nice and they keys are great to type with.  I do not do a lot of writing on my pad but with some of the new apps coming out for the pad I just may start on my memoirs.  Syncing the pad to the keyboard was quick and easy and worked right out of the box with no charging required.  The response of the keys are very fast and I do not even notice the time it take over Bluetooth.New Trent also took care to make sure all of the proper ports were left unobstructed. I even find that most aftermarket cables for the ipad function with this case on.  The one thing I would like to see, and I am not sure if it is even possible would be a all in one usb cord.  One that could connect to a apple charger and into a single usb port instead of having to find two separate ports to use for charging and using the pad.  I do admit that this would be a rare thing but I think it would put this product over the top.I think this product would be great for business men and women, a suitable replacement for a cumbersome laptop or when you just need something small for traveling.  It is a little hard to fit most modern day laptops on a seatback not to mention they are very heavy.  With this product you get a mini laptop just for the cost of your already purchased ipad and less than $40.00.I have enjoyed all the New Trent products to date and I can not wait to see what the good people in this company come up with next.

B001V9LPT4,reasonable,Is quality good?,"These caught my eye when shopping for new buds because of the Android control. While the control capabilities is nice (in theory), the sound quality, durability, and actual ability to control playback makes me happy I bought these well below retail price.As far as sound quality, I would place these in the realm of $20-$30 Skullcandy earbuds. They produce absolutely no bass with any music, and podcasts sound extremely tinny. The drivers are so light that I realized out of the box these would not impress. I have used higher priced Klipsch before, and these had none of the full sound previous pairs had. I am currently using Bose IE2 earbuds as well, and moving back and forth from the Bose to these it surprises me how much cleaner the Bose sound.The build quality is also lacking. I would qualify the build as better than cheap Skullcandy earbuds, but I expect these to shred apart in less than 6 months after careful use. The shielding around the wires is thin, and the connection point to the buds feel like they will either loosen too much or the shielding will wear away at the bud contact points. The ""remote"" portion is not as solidly built as can be, but the one control button has a good click to it. Overall a cheap feel.The actual fit is not bad at all. There are multiple tips, so one is bound to fit properly, and they do a decent job of isolating sound from a tight seal in the ear.The actual control of an Android phone (Droid Incredible 2) is spotty. The app to fully utilize these has a decent amount of setup options for only having one button to use. Sometimes the earbuds control spot on, sometimes I accidentally hang up on a phone call by mistake. There seems to be noticeable lag or non-responsiveness with button presses at times, and was verified to work the in the same spotty nature on a Galaxy Nexus as well. I would have loved a separate set of volume up/down buttons, instead of having to long hold the button to go from lowest volume to loudest without any accuracy.

B0002Y5WXO,accurate,How do you like the auto focus?,"My first every Ebay score, the Canon EF-S 17-85mm lens (featuring image stabilization) was a much coveted item around here.  It had come highly recommended and seemed to be a great complement to my beloved 50mm prime and a perfect replacement for the 18-55mm kit lens that shipped with the XTi.Initial, first-night impressions?  Heavenly.Compared to the other lenses that I've put on the business end of the XTi, the 17-85mm is one heavy dude.  I'd wager that it's at least as heavy as the camera and certainly feels as heavy as the 50mm and the 18-55mm put together.  The lens is serious.  It means business.  It traveled back in time from the future to be here with us today.  It's a touch of the photographic high-tech, made accessible to the amateur.With my right hand on the shutter and my left on the lens' barrel, it didn't feel any less heavy but ""heavy"", in my mind, became ""solid"".  The auto-focus is nice and quiet and is reasonably fast to lock onto the subject.  The focusing ring is also nice and big -- it cries out to be grasped and twisted.  It was a joy to realize that even with the auto-focus turned on, the lens would not complain if I fine-tuned a given shot with some manual adjustments.  (The AF doesn't totally commandeer the focus, that is to say.)  The zoom is also smooth, the barrel moving quickly and easily without over-shooting the desired focal length.Image stabilization is also a big plus.  I have a feeling that once I get the hang of it, it will save quite a few low-light, indoor, and hand-held shots over the lifetime of this lens.  This isn't to be nave and believe it to be a cure-all.  Certainly a few of my early test shots with the IS feature on prove that you can still wind up with a whole mess of blur.  But others worked out pretty well.After having used it for about two weeks or so now, most of these initial impressions have stayed true.  The IS feature is a good one but isn't something upon which to rely to save every shot.  You still need to have good light and the right angle, etc.; but with the right ISO setting, it can save the scene.  The heavy feeling of the lens is something I've gotten used to pretty quickly; after a couple of sessions, you just expect the camera to weight that much -- no worries.  I've also found that the longer focal lengths are great for portraiture -- I find myself using focal lengths in the 70-85mm range pretty often now and I wonder how I ever lived without them before.That said, I'm beginning to wonder a little about the lens' chromatic aberration.  I've had a few shots that don't seem to ""resolve"" the same way during post-processing (in Aperture) as similar shots under similar conditions with the same camera body and a different lens (e.g., the 50mm prime).  This is not to say that I have my mind made up and am squaring the blame on the lens -- certainly not!  But I am trying to parse my way through some of these, experimenting with some different conditions, etc. to see where it lands.  I've just fallen into a certain rhythm with my post-processing and I would hate to have to learn a new dance just for the one, new lens.All things considered however, I've been very pleased with most of my results from the 17-85mm thus far....so yeah, worth it.But with respect to ""worth it"":  Canon lists a retail price of $600 for the EF-S 17-85mm IS lens.  Most places online seem to offer it in the $475-$550 range.  As far as lenses go, this is hardly a costly one.  Considering that this is one of the two lenses ""given away"" as the kit lens for Canon's 40D body, you wonder a little bit if the mass-production maybe watered it down just a little bit...?  Just the same, this is a great ""walk-around"" lens:  it is sturdy, has some great built-in features, and has a versatile range of focal lengths.  If you got this lens ""free"" with your camera body then you are in luck.  If you're looking to pick up one separately...  Well, it's a great lens to have.  And I'm happy with mine.  But see if you can't score one on Ebay or through your local re-seller of high-quality, previously enjoyed lenses.Happy shooting, y'all. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The auto focus is nice,"(893, 915)"
B00ET9YYS2,responsive,How is the keyboard?,"This is a great keyboard.  I also own the original Airbender that I used with my iPad 2.  It was very good and I've been very happy with it, but I have to admit, this is a nice improvement.The overall look is much improved.  It is very clean and professional looking.  It is also somewhat ruggedized though I haven't tested the overall durability.  It is much lighter than the original keyboard and some of the competing keyboards that I checked out.  The weight is heavier than you might expect if you haven't used a keyboard before, but it is a nice complement to the iPad Air.  The overall design makes it very stable when using it on your lap.  The case is designed to allow you to rotate the iPad from landscape to portrait.  This is very convenient and also allows you to choose which direction you like the iPad's buttons to be on.The keyboard itself is surprisingly easy to type on. They keys are normal size and have normal spacing.  I can type on this keyboard as easily as I can my desktop keyboard.  The keys have good feedback.  There are also dedicated iOS keys for home and lock.  Additionally there are the extra keys necessary to work with OSX and Windows.The keyboard connects via Bluetooth.  It is very simple to pair it with the iPad.  While designed for iPad, it also works with iPhones and computers.The keyboard charges via micro-usb.  It does not take long to charge and the battery lasts a very long time.The new Airbender 2.0 also has a nice new design that allows the iPad stand to be removed from the keyboard and stand alone.  This allows you to set it up similar to a separate keyboard and monitor like you would have with your computer.

B00001WRSJ,muddy,What did the bass became?,"Hello, This is my first review for the Sony MDR-V6 with CCAW Voice Coil.SoundFirst I would like to mention that these headphones sound pretty amazing. I've had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble, but for me its very well balanced. The only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it, it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges. Some people mentioned about a &#34;boomy bass&#34; and I disagree. I think the bass is completely fine (I still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though). I like bass a lot and I put my iPod with Bass Boost and it still sounds fine without being &#34;boomy&#34; or &#34;vibrating.&#34; I listened with my galaxy s4 and that sounded fine as well.ComfortSome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable. For me, It was pretty comfortable, but not as comfortable as I thought. At first, it's going to hurt the top of your head for a bit, but after you wear it for a couple of days the uncomfortable-ness goes away. Right now after 1 week, I don't complain about the headband at all. Just like any other over-ears it does get sweaty a bit, so don't wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time :P.BuildThe build is pretty solid, but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap, but its not much to complain about. It's well built overall and it's portable which is a plus for me.AccessoriesIt comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in, which is pretty nice and unexpected. Also it comes with a 1/4&#34; screw on. Problem I had with this screw on is that when I took it back out, for whatever reason the 1/8&#34; connector bent in the middle slightly (maybe because I screwed it on too tight or something.) I just bent it back with the 1/4&#34; adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fine.OtherAnother thing I noticed was that the cable end doesn't really fit well into my s4 when it has its case on. I have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in. Because it's also with a metal end(which makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one) I sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s4. But if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in. I wish the 1/8&#34; was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldn't have to be shoved in.Pros:- Great sound quality. For the most part balanced.- It's actually quite comfortable once you get used to it.- It's portable- It has the coiled wire so it doesn't tangle so easily- It comes with a convenient 1/4&#34; cable. I use it for my P-155 Yamaha Digital Piano.- It doesn't squish your ears, but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones.- Solid Metal endingCons:- High range in treble can get screechy (but that's if you go really high)- It is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head.- The wire is a little bit too long.- The metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the iPod or your phone.tl;dr: it's very good product for headphones under $100. ANSWERNOTFOUND",that had terrible bass,"(187, 209)"
B0074BW614,excellent,How do you like the resolution?,"Love, Love, Love my Kindle (I bought two for the holidays) my granddaughter got one from Santa and I decided to buy myself one.  I have been looking at Kindles for several years as I love to read and watch movies.  I am so glad I waited! It may not be fancy like the well known tablet, but the quality is excellent and does everything other smart devices can do or what I want it to do! Go Amazon!  The brillant colors and sounds through the Kindle is outstanding!  Just can't believe the price!One issue I have with this is having only one prime membership and two devices. My granddaughter can use any material that is in cloud (things that I may want to watch or read; but not age appropriate for her). I try to download my material to my device so I can remove it from Cloud. I tried to use the Kindle Free time feature; but I couldn't keep up with all the apps she is downloading; we only have the purchase parential control on as all of the controls are very restricted.  What is the point in having the device if the child can use it.  She is 11 years old 5th grader on a 8th grade level. The family has spoken about internet safety with her and currently she is following the rules we have set. We have a very secure home network and have features with the network we have set up. Also have installed free app from Norton Security. Within the first 2 hours she was downloading free apps that allowed her to phone & text her friends without any adult instructions! Good news about having the one prime membership I can see what apps she has downloaded from my device without having to log into my account from my laptop.  I can view all of her emails, texts and see the numbers she has phoned.I'm sure I am not using all of the features available; there is only so many free minutes in a day...I Love, Love, Love my Kindle Fire HD!

B00G4UQ6U8,sharp,How was the sound?,"I've owned several brands of IEMs that I use mostly for the gym and listening to music at work without disturbing coworkers.Most IEMs last at least a year or two and then the damage from pulling, sweat, wear and tear etc kill them, which is to be expected. So I purchased these hoping that they would be more durable because of the construction and item description.I was wrong.It's only been 4 months and the bottom part of the cable already causes issues and will only work when held tightly, as headphones will do after years of use, not 4 months.The sound quality is just alright on these. I am a music producer so I know good from bad, and these are as meh as you can get. Not great bass, mids are decent, highs are good. However these stay in my ears worse than almost any IEMs I've ever tried, regardless which ear pieces I use. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The sound quality is just alright on these,"(550, 592)"
B002HWRJBM,replaceable,Where is battery ?,"Pros: Beautifully designed and built. From the perforated look rubberized area where your thumb rests to the brushed metal strips which arcs gracefully around the side of the mouse, to the low gloss plastic finish and the metal scroller wheel with rubber insert, it's a beautiful mouse, high quality mouse.It's extremely comfortable as well. Perhaps not quite as much as my old MX Revolution, but very close.Darkfield is extremely precise and works on every surface I've tried, from my shirt to my glass desk.This is the Cadillac CTS-V of mice.Battery is a removable and replaceable AA unit, a nice feature since internal battery failure caused the death of my MX Revolution.Charging is done via USB cable, so no down time.Battery life on its first full day of use is excellent, still 3 bars after hours of use.Have a middle mouse button again! Now shifting between the wheel modes is done via dedicated button.Nifty little travel casePlenty of programmablity.Cons: Cons are only a few.Forward/back/zoom buttons don't quite fall into reach as naturally as they did on the MX Revolution.Loss of shift-to-click. I'll miss this feature. Loved how the MX Revolution could be programed to switch from geared to free spin depending on how fast the wheel spun, then would switch back.Other Thoughts: My dear MX Revolution bit the dust on me a few weeks ago, due to internal battery failure, yet despite buying the original four years ago, Logitech replaced it with the new model.It's really worth saying that their customer support is superb, friendly, and helpful. They also send you return shipping labels now so you don't have to pay for shipping. Now that's progress. Turnaround was about 2 weeks total. I will continue to buy products from Logitech, they stand behind them.My only other minor complaint is the Application Switcher. I don't care for it...distorts the windows and when many are up it looks cluttered. But that's just a keystroke assignment away to set it back to Document Flip, so it's not an issue.Overall I love this mouse so far, and while I do miss my MX Revolution, this is a worthy successor. It's even better looking and very nearly as comfortable, very precise and works on surfaces the old mouse never could.Hopefully it will last!

B00FFJ0HUE,excellent,What is the quality of the screen?,"The idea of having a Windows 8 convertible with 10+ hours of battery life with Office 2013 included for $400 seemed like a bad infomercial promise, but it turned out to be true for my purposes.  I was looking for a second computer that could do fairly basic Windows stuff and multimedia while also being very compact and having a long battery life.I had previously purchased an Atom-based Asus netbook that was atrociously slow and only lasted a few hours, plus the fan was annoyingly loud.Here are my findings:GOOD:- The T100 is as fast as you need a second computer to be.  MS Office runs smoothly, all videos play well and it's never slowed down terribly so far.  I haven't run any processor-intensive stuff yet like Photoshop or Crisis, but that's not why I purchased it.- The screen is rather nice.  It's an IPS WXGA screen, which pales in comparison to some 1080p phones, but for a 10.2"" netbook, it works well.  Text is readable and videos look great.  The brightness isn't spectacular and the reflectivity is high, but it's very crisp and the viewing angles are excellent.- There are no fans.  It runs cool.  It runs silent.- The speakers are better than my 17"" laptop.  Not great in the bass department, but they're loud.  I just wish they were facing forward instead of backward.- It's super light and compact.  I'm able to read holding just the screen and the whole package, including the keyboard, fits nicely into the Kensington tablet sling I just purchased.- The construction is solid.  Yes, the lid and screen are smudge-prone, but it's all solid state and thoughtfully arranged...for a $400 piece of hardware.BAD:- The WiFi is a bit wonky.  When I wake my computer, sometimes the WiFi won't work but when I just turn the laptop's WiFi antenna off and on, everything goes back to normal.- The charger is as slow as people are reporting.  Sometimes it charges fairly slowly, other times, not at all.  Still working that out.- The trackpad is annoying and unpredictable.  Once I turned off the tap-to-click feature, it was much more manageable except the trackpad clicks are conspicuously loud.  Remedied by a bluetooth mouse.OTHER THOUGHTS:- I appreciate the microSD slot.  I put in a 64GB chip and it works great.- Some have complained about the single-antenna WiFi, but it hasn't bothered me at all.  Streaming music and video is not a problem.- The tablet doesn't fit in immediately so you kind of have to wiggle it in so it will fit flush with the keyboard.- Windows 8.1 presents a learning curve.  It's also not the greatest OS for a tablet computer.  But once you get used to the quirks, it's not a dealbreaker.- The keyboard is small but totally usable.  With its weird layout and lack of backlighting, it's not great in the dark, but otherwise, it's fine.IN SUM:For me, this computer does everything I expect it to do.  It's tiny, relatively fast and the battery life is tops.  That said, there are many idiosyncrasies that you must contend with.  WiFi, keyboard and charging require some fiddling, but maybe those things will be ironed out in future updates.All in all, it's a great piece of hardware.  If you're looking for something that has the portability of a tablet but the functionality of a laptop for $400, it's an amazing deal that can't be beat.  For the price, there are better laptops and there are better tablets, but as a low-priced combo, it's a grand slam. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The screen is rather nice,"(777, 802)"

B0088CJT4U,different,How is design?,"I was interested in using this router to replace a DLink-655, which has been having intermittent connection failures requiring a reboot. I have a fairly large area that i want to cover. Note that unlike a typical router user, I specifically wanted to use this as an access point, thus my use case and experience are a bit different than typical.Overall, I was very pleased with this router.Because I couldn't figure out from the documentation how to set it up as an access point, i contacted tech support. I expected a response within a day or so. They responded in less than half a day with detailed instructions.Setup an install was very fast and easy. Basically, needed the router to the LAN and replace the internet connection on a computer, then access it via IP. This was all very simple to do. After that, needed to configure the two wireless band configurations and a few other settings. The overall menu system on the router is well laid out, with good explanations and has a good depth of controllable features. Responsiveness is quite fast. For the configuration i was doing i needed to do a software reboot, and that kept the connection nicely throughout.Once i setup the router, connections were strong and solid. I've used both bands without issues. Signal seems good and stable. I'm also running a number of direct lines from the router as well as the wireless connections. All is good.

B003M0NURK,own,How was the power supply?,"I have two of these on two different computers, and they've both been working fine. (This is the AmazonBasics USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hub, since Amazon might lump reviews for all products on this page together.) The included USB cable is very short, which is fine for one of my computers, but on another I'm using this in combination with a short extension cable to help it reach my desk, where I want it. The short cable may be nice in some situations. All ports work as expected. This is is not a powered hub (except via the bus), so don't expect to charge an iPad on it, but it still works for my smaller devices (e.g., Kindle).The only thing I don't like is that the LED on the top is rather bright and is lit up whenever this hub is connected.

B005FYNSPK,helpful,Was the review very helpful?,"Four (4) SanDisk Cruzer Fit CZ33 32GB USB Flash Drive (SDCZ33-032G-B35)(UPC 6 19659 07621 4 and 80-56-10198-032G) for $17.99 each Prime is a rather good buy on 20121025.  The description provided by Amazon, the seller, was rather lack-luster.  Here is my summary of my thoughts-and-impression.1) Ordered Oct 22, arrived Oct 242) Ordered four (4), got four3) Arrived in a rather big box with contents flopping though no visible damage - combined with another order4) Flash Drive includes unmentioned SanDisk SecureAccess software (AES-128bit) that is a little out-of-date.  Should be at least AES-256bit and should use FAT32 at a minimum with NTFS preferred. It is a USB2 device.5) Testing flash drive (Win):a) root directory has two visible folders (club-application and SanDiskSecureAccess)b) root directory has two executable files (RunClubSanDisk.exe and RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exe)c) root directory has a hidden file autorun.inf (can be opened with Notepad if curious)d) flash drive packaging indicates WinXP, Vista, and 7 are supported as well as Mac OS X v10.5+e) Mac users needing security are directed to the SanDisk website's SecureAccess page (URL will be censored by Amazon) for downloadf) The club application was of absolutely no interest and the associated folders/files were deleted.  It is one of those, ""Get special offers from SanDisk partners"" RPIA's.g) The SanDisk SecureAccess Quick Start Guide is a PDF located in the SanDiskSecureAccess folder.  If the SanDisk SecureAccess process is something that has never been used, this provided guide would be a must to read - it is short.h) If I recall, correctly, the, unwritten, MAXIMUM, vault size is 4gb which is sufficiently large to hold the contents of one (1) DVD.  If compressed (ZIP'd) files are written to the flash drive, it is often possible to squeeze more than 4gb of uncompressed files into the 4gb vault space; however, this is way to subjective to give any ""reasonable"" percentage since compression depends upon the compression software and the file content being compressed (e.g. video, text, spreadsheet, document, database, etc.).i) Normally, I delete all of these provided tools.  If I change my mind at some future date, I can go to the SanDisk website and download the SecureAccess software. (If there is the curious streak, the older U3 software is also available that is more userfriendly and more out-of-date and does NOT use the ""vault"" concept.  Get both the install and the uninstall software if you think about using it.  BTW, you are, of course on your own though the support folks will sometimes answer questions.)j) If you do use the provided tools, do MAKE SURE the Closing your private vault instructions, on page 8 (English) are followed.  The flash like any plug-and-play device will mostly always be unaffected by just yanking from the USB port; however, the more important the information stored, the greater the chance the once-in-a-million ""oops"" corruption will strike.k) There is a place on the drive to attach a lanyard, or string, to keep loss at a minimum.  I am thinking the cap is a gonner since it does not fit all that securely; however, this comment in no way obviates the intended purpose of the device and how it works.  Just doNOT use peanut butter as a place to stick the drive to keep it from getting lost (you are going to have to figure out the reasoning for this comment).l) Did they work?It was curious that the thumbnail icon for the flash drives was that for the ClubSanDisk and not the SanDisk SecureAccess when it appeared.  It seemed to have a great deal of difficulty in displaying after the longer than expected recognition and driver-installation.  Specificially, the autorun.inf was configured for the ClubSanDisk.I changed my autorun.inf to the following (if you choose to do so, YOU do it at your own ""RISK!""):[autorun]action=SecureAccessopen=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeicon=RunSanDiskSecureAccess_Win.exeWhat does this mean if the icon does not show?  Well, you may have to ""guess"" which drive letter is associated with your flash drive - no biggie; but, rather annoying.  For some reason, I got noticably slower access and usage, ""IF"" I had a USB3 device plugged into one of the available USB2 ports at the same time.m) Getting the little drive out of the packaging was an interesting exercise in frustration.  The first one I could extract ""almost"" using the cut line indicated on the packaging.  The second one required a little more effort since the cap was stuck to the packaging which required major surgery to get the clear plastic unstuck from the cap.  The third flash was a little easier to extract from the packaging though the cap did provide a moment!  The fourth drive packaging was cut on the bottom end and this seemed to allow easier extraction of the drive and the cap.  Also, then) Insertion and removal from a powered USB hub; and, the same for other USB ports was reasonably effortless due to the lanyard connector that offered a place to get a grip.o) The flash drive device is not realy designed, in my opinion, for a lot of insertions and removals from a USB port.  I always connect these ""cheap"" devices to a powered-USB port so any damage done by the device's connector only affects the easily replaced hub and does not damage my computer.Close, click ""eject"" ... and ... REMEMBER, it is better to be safe than be the ""did it to yourself"" victim because the ""Safely Remove Hardware"" icon in your tray was not used!  A few words of CAUTION, do make sure the intended drive letter for the Flash Drive is the one chosen to be removed! ANSWERNOTFOUND",Four 32,"(0, 35)"

B0027VT6V4,more,How are the bass?,"These speakers ROCK. I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the ""sweet spot"" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of ""small"" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried. They are easily 10x better than integrated speakers in TVs, laptops, etc. and they are a few steps above every speaker set in the less than $70 price range.

I walk to campus about every day to go to class and I hear music with these. It has been a great upgrade from any wired headphones and there is no wire to mess with.Audio:Audio is basic for stereo headphones. There is nothing amazing about the base in these headphones. I have mixed the settings alot on the headphones and my phone to see what is the best I can get from the headphones. With the seetings at it's best the headphones are about basic for audio quality. I've gotten better quality sound from $15 Skullcandy headphones (Skullcandy Ink'd S2INBI-UB).Phone usage:Used them every once and a while to answer phone calls and the quality is actually great. I am heard clearly and I can also hear clearly too. The volume that you can get with these headphone is amazing. Very loud, so be careful how high you have the volume.Conection:I have been very disapointed with the conectivity of these headphones. It is rated for about 30 ft range and my headphones cut out at about 10 ft. Also when I look down, most time to see what I am doing or where I am walking, the headphones cut out. I've held the left side of the base of the headphones and aperantly there is a deathgrip in signal there.Pros:+ Great quality+ Earbuds have magnets that connect it to the base when not in use+ Vibrate and ring when call comes in (even is cell is on silent)+ Very light+ Can be very load+ Clear call qualities+ Great battery life (last me all day of ussage)Cons:- Poor audio quality- Connection limits- Deathgrip on the left side- Somestimes a little too loudGreat for what it is as a bluetooth headset for a phone, but needs to improve audio quality for it to be a great set of headphones.I would've rated these as a four star but since they are advertised as stereo headsets. It needs alot of improvement to get good ratings. I rate them as three star as headphones, but I rate them as four star as bluetooth headphones. Much better than those that just go in one ear.

B0074BW614,more,Is a problem common?,"I've used an e-reader since the Rocket ebook in 1999, and I've always believed I wanted only an ebook reader with no other features. I don't get out much, so my computer is convenient for everything else.I've had several Kindles and was happy with all of them, but I had recently played around with my brother's tablet. When my last Kindle died, I decided to replace it with the Kindle Fire. I chose the smaller one because I was concerned about my arthritic hands holding a larger device for long periods. The 7"" is just perfect for me. It's light enough that I can hold it to read, but the larger screen compared to the Kindle makes for easier reading. I love the color, something I never thought would make a difference to me.Oddly enough, high on my favorite list is the ability to review a book as soon as I reach the end. I have written reviews of every book I read on a readers social media site, but I have seldom put in the extra effort to come to Amazon to write a review. On the Kindle Fire, as soon as I come to the end of a book, a review page pops up so I can review it while it's fresh on my mind, and I'm reviewing everything I read.I didn't realize when I placed my order that I was ordering that the device had special offers. I've always thought I would not want to be subject to advertising when I was reading. However, I discovered that the special offers are discreet and no distraction at all. I've even found myself going to the special offers page a time or two to see what's on offer.The only negative is that the battery doesn't last very long. However, with the PowerFast charger, it doesn't take long to charge the battery.I think folks like me who have always used a dedicated ereader and never even used a touch screen will be pleasantly surprised with the Kindle Fire, and people who are used to smartphones and tablets will find everything they expect in a device.Update 11/8/13: I still think the Kindle Fire is a fantastic product, and I use it occasionally for games. However, I have gone back to my Kindle Keyboard for reading novels. The arthritis in my shoulders, elbows, and hands has  worsened since I've been using the Kindle Fire, and even using the device for a short while increases the pain significantly. I can tolerate it for short periods to play a few games. However, I simply can't hold the Kindle Fire long enough for reading. This won't be an issue for most people, but I wanted to mention it for those people who might have similar problems. ANSWERNOTFOUND",have similar problems,"(2473, 2494)"
B00E3W15P0,new,How do you like the computer?,"Exactly what I expected, a consumer-class SSD at a good price. My motherboard actually does not support SATA III, so my EVO is actually bottlenecked a bit. TRIM and other such still works 100%, but reaching maximum speeds is impossible. However, this thing is still FAST! I actually notice it being faster than the 128GB Mushkin Chronos I've since relegated to a backup drive (for the crime of being too small), and that drive bottlenecked on my SATA II motherboard too. Windows 8 boots in just over half the time it takes my motherboard to drag itself through the POST and RAID (5, for my three 640GB WD Blues) readouts. Samsung software has an ""AHCI is disabled"" warning even though it is enabled (I am using RAID 5 on the same storage controller, and RAID does not work without AHCI). Installation was dead simple, and the software is completely optional albeit somewhat useful.Things to note:Write speed is not sustained, the EVOs use a buffer of super-fast memory to write to.When this buffer overflows you lose the advertised maximum and return to write speeds typical of the regular 840The 840 Pro is a superior product in terms of raw performance but you probably don't need an 840 Pro anywayIf you choose not to optimize with the Samsung software, move your pagefile off the SSD if you can help it as pagefiles cause SSD wear.

The connection was very slow and the Toshiba often just froze up. So, I finally got this WRT54GL.Installation was relatively easy, but I had trouble getting my new router profile to stay as the default connection. I went through about five Cisco customer reps in India to try to get things right. They were unfailingly friendly and polite and I believe they tried their best to help (contrary to what I see in other customer reviews). I finally ended up with Christina who re-configured the connection remotely and made the new router profile stay on top as the default. Hurray!

B002MAPRYU,easy,How is the navigation?,"The player itself is tiny and very cute. It feels solid and well-made. However, they don't tell you it's optimized for use with the Rhapsody music service, which I thought was a little sneaky. The music service is free for 30 days, then it costs $10 a month thereafter, but you can cancel anytime. I haven't looked at the music they offer and probably never will. I didn't want a music service. I wanted an MP3 player. Apparently, there are features for this MP3 player that are only available through the Rhapsody download. I haven't set it up yet so I don't know what that means. The owner's manual is a PDF file on the San Disk site, if you can find it. If you register your player with them, they may share your information with overseas sites that aren't secure. Spiffy. At least they're upfront about it, in a vivid red ink disclaimer, but still...why??? The player has a built-in FM radio and microphone. The display is very easy to read. It is packaged with ear buds and a USB charger.June 10, 2013: UPDATE!Okay, now that I've finished having a panic attack, I can happily report I was wrong about the Sansa Clip+ MP3 player. The Rhapsody Music Service software CD is optional. I used Amazon's Cloud Player download instead. So far, all the device's features are working fine. The ear buds packaged with the Sansa Clip+ are  comfortable. The sound quality is excellent. The display is easy to read, even in bright light. The battery charged in less than three hours. I kept thinking the display looked weird, then I realized I was looking at a stick-on screen protector. It peeled off easily and left no residue behind. The menus are simple and well thought out. All the controls are easy to find, easy to use. The USB 2.0 transfer cable is very short, about 9 inches long, but it wasn't a problem. The Sansa Clip+ plugged in to my laptop and the music transfer was a breeze! If you want a tiny, but well-made and easy to use MP3 player, buy the Sansa Clip+ MP3 player.

B002MAPRYU,bad,How is the battery?,"I struggled giving this a 3 star review, because the low price should be a factor int he score.  But is the MP3 player decent or not?  The price really shouldn't matter or decide whether it's good or bad.  And the truth it, it's both.For one, the Rhapsody software it want you to use is junk.  Get rid of it because it doesn't do what it's supposed to and it's clunky, crappy, outdated software.  The way to sync media with this device is with Windows Media Player.  It works best and is the program that makes the most sense.Now to the device.  For one, the buttons are spotty on mine.  Occasionally, the pause button just decides to not work, so I essentially have to shut the thing off at that point.  Which isn't a big deal if you're just listening to songs.  But if you listen to audiobooks or radio shows you've recorded or podcasts, it doesn't ALWAYS save your location on the file.  It usually does, but again, it's spotty and occasionally the device just decides to not save where it was in the file.Another major problem I've had is the battery life.  I'll turn on my device to see it with 50% power.  Then, about 20 minutes later, it shuts off inexplicably and tries to tell me that the battery is empty.  Great.Now this thing is light and I like that.  It clips very comfortably on to your clothes and the clip is sturdy.  So that's one in the plus column.  It's inexpensive but at no point using this device have I forgotten that.  It feels cheap through and through.  And really... it's not all THAT cheap.Otherwise, it does what it's supposed to do.  It plays music files.  You can create custom playlists in WMP or whichever syncing software you choose and it's cool.  Navigating through menus is pretty straight forward.  The sound is decent.Everything about this MP3 player is average at best.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If you're looking for a solid MP3 player that's light and relatively inexpensive, I personally think you'll be fien here.  It's great for working out and things like that.  I paid nearly $60 for mine and for that price, it does it's job.  Nothing more though.  It doesn't impress me or leave me blown away.  It just does what I paid it to do.

B004E10KFG,how good,Is sound clear?,"I bought this device for $150 instead of 200 during a (Black Friday?) sale. This is a pretty crucial difference.I'm going to basically jump into pros and cons, then conclude. I will compare to theMonster ClarityHD Precision Micro Bluetooth Speaker 100 Portable Bluetooth Speaker (MBL CLY SPKR BT)at some points.Pros:-Great design, looks fantastic (I like all the colors except red, but I really liked the ""grill"" on the grey one).-Very minimalistic, simple, and elegant. Follows an ""Apple"" product theme. It has only 3 buttons, and the on/off switch.-Sound Quality is good. This is a small speaker so its never going to be amazing, but I find it rather good for the size. This speaker shines in having good High/Lows, a very rich sound, and really good Bass. In comparison to the Clarity HD which I also tried, the sound is much richer. Though the Clarity HD does indeed have good clarity, the Jambox is as good in that sense as well.-Very easy to use, pairing is incredible fast and simple (after I got it out of the box it was paired in maybe 15 seconds).-Has a website where you can download some small features (kind of useless) but also new firmware and technology that is improving the sound of the Jambox such as ""Live Audio"". Live Audio (i think) separates the Left and Right more and I do indeed think it improves the sound, but it comes at the cost of having a lower Maximum volume. More on volume below.-10 hour battery life. I never actually checked this and I seriously doubt it's 10 hours, but it's much higher advertised than the other bluetooth speakers, so it's safe to assume that the batterlife even if not 10 hours, is still much longer than other speakers like the Clarity HD.Cons:-Loudness. I think the loudness of this speaker is mis-advertised as I was a little bit dissapointed. At home, this thing is great. Easily fills my room, and when I turned it up downstairs, you could still hear it Upstairs in different rooms. If you want the better sound with Live Audio, it is ~2-3 volume levels (Clicks of the button) less, so it is quite a bit. When I took this to a social function with about 15 people all in a room, you could hardly hear some songs when people were talking. This also however depends on the song itself. I think if you were to turn up most songs in Itunes (Volume wise) above 100%, they would still sound good (not distorted). So I hope that the volume cap is put higher in a update (which is why updates are a very nice feature). The Clarity HD gets much louder, but once again the sound is a lot worse. If volume is crucial for you, the Clarity HD might be a nice option (Check out my review on it). Overall I think most people are going to be satisfied with the volume, and if you really need a boost, you can connect the device by wire and the sound gets MUCH louder, as loud if not louder than the Clarity HD on bluetooth.Edit: Along with LiveAudio, there is also a feature called ""Sound Clarity"" which once again, says it will improve audio sound at the cost of some volume, when LiveAudio is DISabled. So I had both these features enabled therefore I didn't have maximum sound. So this device CAN get a little bit louder than I thought. I still think the choice between volume and sound quality is a nice one, however to change this you need to connect to a computer, so this cannot be easily shifted on the go.-Price, $200 is a lot but the market for these devices is quite high as it is. The Clarity HD is twice as cheap on Amazon right now, but as i said before, I got my Jambox for $150 so that made a huge difference in my mind. For $50 more, I would hands down prefer the Jambox over Clarity HD. For $100, the question becomes more clouded. If you have the money and are willing to spend it, you will not feel bad about spending $150 as I think you will be very satisfied with the Jambox, it's just got a pleasing feel to it.(This isn't really a con, but a concern) -Portability: Im not certain how portable this is. Its really small and easy to carry but you do need some kind of bag, as its awkward to just carry in your hand. You do get a nice case with it. The best option without an extra bag is I guess a decently big jacket pocket would fit it. It is portable but I think its kind of peculiar to carry around, if you have Purse or some kind of backpack or anything, that problem is dissolved.Conclusion: This is a great product though it is quite pricey. It has really good sound quality and bass for its size and purpose. I am concerned about how loud this could get in a very loud enviornment, but I suspect for most people, it will be good enough. The firmware updates make this kind of problem solvable, and leave the Jambox with room to improve. The design and features are really nice. Compared to the Clarity HD, I think the reviews are misleading. The Clarity HD has notable MUCH worse sound quality, but it does get louder and is cheaper. The firmware updates are a nice touch and give you options for better sound, which is also very nice. In every other aspect such as design and battery life, the Jambox is also supreme.Extra-Topical: My Jambox is actually going to be RMA'd beacuse it has some kind of glitch or is defective, but a few times, the Bluetooth connection would just be a random sound, like a signal, but it wouldnt play any music and would make weird crackling sounds. The wire would still play music however. Recently I could barely even get bluetooth to play music, rather than these weird sounds as if it were broken, so this is a big problem. I am hoping this is just my unit so its not impacting the review, but if my new one has this problem, I may make an edit.Also, this isnt really a connectivity drop because it isnt silence, its this weird droning noise. But on the topic of connectivity. Ive never had a drop on my Itouch even while walking downstairs which the Jambox is upstairs. However, my sisters IPhone 4G had like 4 drops in one session of listening. Im not really sure what caused the connection loss and I dont know if its specific to the Iphone 4G but this may be a problem. Never happend to me though.

B0074BW614,amazing,How does the device work?,"I got this for Christmas and loved it immediately.  I waited to review it, because glitches and problems generally show up after the excitement has worn off.  I've had a couple of thoughts of ""I wish,"" but nothing that would make me lower my rating.  Here's what I like--and what I don't:This screen is absolutely beautiful.  I wanted it mostly for books, but videos and content are flawless on it.  The books are beautiful and crisp, too, with plenty of options to change brightness and color.  This cuts down on eye strain.  There is a glare, in bright sun.  This is worse than a regular kindle, but not as bad as most tablets.  I was expecting much worse, with the HD screen, so I've just put it down as the best possible at this time.I wanted this because I'm in college and constantly needing books.  It's faster, easier, and cheaper to download kindle books than to try to buy them in a physical copy, especially when I need  some of the more obscure titles for my classes.  I still have books that I want for myself in hardback form, but nothing beats kindle for college!The build is sturdy, but light.  I don't feel like I'm going to break it if I touch it, but it's comfortable to hold.A lot of people complain about not being able to get Google play content and try to find workarounds, but I don't need that, so it's not an issue for me.  I'd rather buy from Amazon, anyway.  Past experience has taught me that their customer service and quality is superior.  If you aren't like me and you want to be able to access absolutely everything in the world on one device, it might be a drawback.  For me, it's not a problem.  I haven't come across anything I need that Amazon doesn't offer--usually cheaper and/or better then the other guys.I am not very techno-savvy, so it's a plus for me that this device is easy and ready to use right out of the box.  I signed in to Amazon and had everything I've bought in the past at my fingertips.One MINOR drawback is the memory.  You'd think 16gb was enough, but it's only enough if you keep your content in the cloud.  That's fine, if you aren't traveling, but if you find yourself without wifi access you cannot get to your content.  I downloaded a season of a tv show, knowing I would be without wifi, and it really ate up the memory, slowing my kindle fire down a lot.  After watching, I removed the episodes from the device and the slowdown disappeared.  I found myself wishing for more memory, then.  Most of the time, though, I rely on the cloud and 16gb is fine.  I just have to remember that small limitation.  (If I were buying one, I'd go with the 32gb model, personally, and have a little more room to download content for the times I'll be without access.  This was a gift, so I cannot really complain.)  I love the cloud and use it for most things, anyway, so it's a minor issue.  The only time memory is a problem is when I'm traveling.  For some, that might be a bigger issue than it is for me, as it's a portable device.  On my daughter's tablet, which has expandable memory, we are able to download a lot more content and take it with us.  Entertainment is never out of reach, even without internet.  All in all, though, my kindle is easier to work, has a better screen, and is organized better.  Everything has drawbacks.I haven't found anything in the three weeks I've had my kindle fire that would make it anything less than a great value.  I definitely recommend this device.  It has been very helpful and entertaining. ANSWERNOTFOUND",loved it immediately,"(29, 49)"
B002MAPRYU,intuitive,How was the operation?,"Fantastic. I dubbed mine ""The iPod killer"". After fighting my old 3rd gen 8gb iPod nano for a few years. I decided enough was enough and I wanted something that I could use in whatever mannerism I wished to. So, i bought the 8gb clip+, a 16GB micro SD card and installed rockbox(a free third party firmware) onto the clip. I could not be happier with the results, people are constantly amazed when i tell them that i managed to build a 24GB mp3 player with custom firmware and in this size for only $75. It really can't be beat except for on battery life. However, I don't really see how you could ever kill the battery in one day and it would probably even be quite unlikely in two days. I charge mine and switch around music every few days without it ever dying on me.Pros-Portability-Clip-micro SD slot-High Capacity to begin with-ability to change firmwares and to use product as you wish (ex. click and drag files instead of using clunky programs)Cons- I can only think of one and that is the battery life. I could see the battery getting weak enough to where it might die within a long days use and that would be troublesome for me. But, as of right now I charge every few days and have no worries. I WILL update if i ever see any decline in battery life to the point of it bothering me.-I also would like to note that the text might prove kind of hard to see out of the box for people with any problems seeing smaller text. However, with the use of 3rd party firmware you can change the text to any size that you want. But, keep in mind it requires some effort to install the 3rd party firmware and even then the screen is still small, so larger text gets kind of cumbersome. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with problems seeing, but on the other hand I can't really think of many media players that I would. Definitely nothing that is even close to the size of this device.Summary: All in all I couldn't have bought any device close to the capacity as this one for as much as I paid for the device and the SD card. Throw in the fact that it is so small and that I can put on whatever firmware I want and just drag and drop my files and I'm simply astounded by this product. ANSWERNOTFOUND",dubbed,"(13, 19)"
B0074BW614,good,How was the customer support?,"AWESOME, INCREDIBLE, Any other positive you can think of.  I have been thinking about getting a tablet for each of my daughters and have been reading reviews and checking out every device I can get my hands on.  I know I didn't want the el-cheepo tablets you can get for $99.  I've seen those and checked them out and they are tablets, but generally have older operating system, lack support, and don't support all the apps.  I didn't want a limited device.  I also didn't want to spend $350 per device either.  I have heard of people that got the Kindles and were very happy with them so I decided to take a chance and get 2 of them.  For the price of the refurb devices, with a percentage off e-coupon that I had, plus using my amazon points from my Amazon credit card, I was able to basically get 2 of these for the price of one.  I set my expectations a bit low because I didn't think of them as full tablets, but I'm happy to report I was rather wrong in that area.  I was very, very impressed with the Kindle Fire HD 7 inch tablet.  I have a full 10 inch Acer Iconia tablet that I like and my kids like but it's a bit large for them.  This is the perfect size and feels so good in the hands.  The screen is very clear, and the sound these things produce is just amazing.  I couldn't believe how amazing the sound on these is, and how loud!  My kids are getting them for Christmas and I can't wait to see their jaws hit the ground!  Amazon uses a custom interface for the Android OS, but it doesn't make it any less functional. It is a bit different getting used to compared with the standard Android interface, but it works fine.  It was able to do pretty much whatever I wanted to do with it.  Once you get used to the different interface, it's just as easy to get around in it as anything else, and if it's your first exposure to the world of tablet devices, I think it would be much easier to learn and get comfortable with.  I can't be happier with these things and actually, even though I have a 10 inch tablet, I'm very much considering getting one of these for me too.  I like it that much.Now, as for the refurbished part, don't be afraid of that word.  I get refurb stuff all the time and so far, here's what my experience is... they are great!  It seems like the refurb items have had all the bugs worked out and have had more rigorous testing than the new devices.  I've had plenty of new things stop working on me and had to get them replaced or repaired, but I've never had one single refurb device have any issue at all... ever (knock on wood!!).  These had no signs of ever having been used.  Not one single scratch or blemish, and Amazon's support is growing to be legend.  They want people to be happy with their purchases and will go the extra mile to ensure you are, so the support they offer is very good.I guess the bottom line is, if you are looking to get a tablet to start into the tablet world, or want something for the kids, then you have to consider this.  The price is excellent and it's a great tablet.  You won't be dissapointed. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This is the perfect size,"(1141, 1165)"
B00E3W15P0,new,How do you like the computer?,"Exactly what I expected, a consumer-class SSD at a good price. My motherboard actually does not support SATA III, so my EVO is actually bottlenecked a bit. TRIM and other such still works 100%, but reaching maximum speeds is impossible. However, this thing is still FAST! I actually notice it being faster than the 128GB Mushkin Chronos I've since relegated to a backup drive (for the crime of being too small), and that drive bottlenecked on my SATA II motherboard too. Windows 8 boots in just over half the time it takes my motherboard to drag itself through the POST and RAID (5, for my three 640GB WD Blues) readouts. Samsung software has an ""AHCI is disabled"" warning even though it is enabled (I am using RAID 5 on the same storage controller, and RAID does not work without AHCI). Installation was dead simple, and the software is completely optional albeit somewhat useful.Things to note:Write speed is not sustained, the EVOs use a buffer of super-fast memory to write to.When this buffer overflows you lose the advertised maximum and return to write speeds typical of the regular 840The 840 Pro is a superior product in terms of raw performance but you probably don't need an 840 Pro anywayIf you choose not to optimize with the Samsung software, move your pagefile off the SSD if you can help it as pagefiles cause SSD wear.

B0042X9LC4,fantastic,Why is this camera fantastic?,"I loved my D90, and thought long and hard about upgrading to the D7000.  It arrived yesterday as promised (Thanks Amazon! Awesome service once again), and I have to say, this camera is awesome.  The feel of the camera is very sturdy, the shutter sound is great.  I've taken about 150 shots with it, and am very pleased with the outcome using my Nikon 16-85mm lens.  As great as the D90 was, I feel that the D7000 is a good upgrade, and well worth the money....Thanks ANSWERNOTFOUND",Thanks Amazon,"(107, 120)"
B003BYRGJU,large,How is ear?,"These headphones are strong, well built, good looking. Sound wise they are quite capable of sounding loud and full based on hooking up to a ipod nano. They are bassy. If you like bass, you will like the sound of these.What I didn't like about these is the fit. Even though the band has stretched after certain period of time, I still find them uncomfortable. I can listen to these for an hour or so. Then I find my ears feel hot and these headphones are pressing my ears. Then again I am spoiled by the comfort and lightness of the bose OE2 which has become my default over the ear headphones of choice.So if you like bass, ad are used to over the ear headphones that are of a tight fit, you will likely love these. For me personally, I use them less often as they are uncomfortable for me. These are the design and I can't hold it against the manufacturer. Therefore I minused only one star.

B000KJQ1DG,bright,Is it a good lcd screen?,"Nikon has hit a grand slam with this camera. It's as close to perfection as any digital camera has ever come. Sure, there are ""better"" cameras for more money, but they are all twice the size/weight. I would get this camera even if I had an unlimited amount of money to spend. There is simply nothing like it. Lots of ingenius user interface elements, superb feel/handling, superb flash (both internal and external SB-400), outstanding image quality, instant response, superb viewfinder, superb LCD... I could go on. I have nothing bad to say about it, and I'm extremely picky. I thought I was going to wait for a full-frame sensor body, but when this came along, I could not wait to upgrade.The lack of a built-in focusing motor is an ADVANTAGE in my opinion. It's one reason the camera is so small and lightweight, and I believe all future Nikon lenses will have internal focusing anyway. So unless you want to use older, heavier, and slower focusing lenses for some strange reason, you'd be paying for and carrying around something you won't even use.In addition to the superb 18-55mm (i.e. 27-82.5mm) kit lens, I bought the 55-200mm VR II and 50mm F/1.8D lenses, the SB-400 external flash and a remote (3rd party off Ebay). I suspect many, many people will buy this exact set of equipment, since it's really all you'll ever need. No need for an extra battery, unless you ever go many photo-filled days without being able to recharge. Get at least two 1GB 50x (or faster) SD cards, so if one stops working (it does happen), you aren't stuck.The 55-200mm VR (i.e. 82.5-300mm) is a necessity for shooting any action/wildlife. The optical stabilization is truly awesome, and better than sensor-based stabilization (e.g. Pentax K10D, Sony Alpha) since you can see it working right through the viewfinder, making it easier to frame/focus your shot. Although the lens may seem slow (f4-5.6), don't forget that stabilization gives you an extra 2-3 stops, so it's really more like f2-2.8 (without the reduced depth of field, of course). DO NOT consider the slightly cheaper non-VR version, unless the slightly smaller size is an absolute necessity.The 50mm (i.e. 75mm) is a nice walkaround lens when you want to go as light/small as possible. It's super fast (f1.8!), allowing you to take handheld photos at night with no flash! It's also a nice portrait lens, although the 55-200 is better (75mm is a little short).The D40x is a poorer choice for the vast majority of people. The extra resolution means your photos take up more space and are slower to work with. It also has a slower max. flash sync speed (1/200 vs 1/500). If you don't know what this means, trust me, it's important, and one day you'll be really happy you have it. Since the D40's pixels are larger (less pixels in the same size sensor), there is less noise, so having ISO 100 is useless. Do you really need 10MP? Do you print larger than 16x20? Heck, do you print at all? I know I don't. Think it will give you more cropping ability? Think again. Without a super expensive lens ($1k+), the lack of sharpness and magnified distortion of the cropped image won't be as good as the uncropped 6MP of the D40. Save the $200 and use it to get the 55-200 lens, or the 50mm lens and the flash.If you're ready to move to a DSLR, take this camera for a test drive. You will most likely fall in love with it's wonderful handling, and excellent performance, as so many people have. There will be a new generation of cameras coming out this fall, so you may want to wait, although there's really nothing that can be improved upon with this camera.

B00H3OYSHW,rubbery,Where can I feel my device?,"I ordered my new NewTrend Airbender Pro NT610KR from Amazon.  I received it a few days later. It was great timing because I was just getting ready to leave on a business trip. I rapidly removed it from the box.  My initial impression was great. Starting from the cool box to the wireless keyboard case. The case looks great. It feels very sturdy and nice looking.  It is little thicker than my old case (another great case from NewTrend Airbend 2.0 (NT510K)).Next, I had to charge the case to use it. I had only a few hours left before I left. Now the charging process is a little strange.  The manual says that the light indicator should be lighted in RED, but I never saw it. I waited and eventually the light turned BLUE  (maybe the RED indicator only shows when the battery is dead. I will have to post an update once the first charge is over).Then came it came to placing my iPad Air into the new case. I struggled a little. The case is very tight. It is harder to take it apart.  Putting it together was very easy once I figured out how to take it apart. Each of the important input places are protected by a small tab which fits perfectly and makes the iPad well protected.  The case comes with a screen protector which is nice (I already have my screen protector), but I figured it will provide a double protection.  Now I had everything ready for my trip.When I boarded my flight, I was finally ready to use it.  First I needed to open the case to the position that felt most comfortable. There is a release button in the on the side of the case that releases the extension arm.  I pulled it too far and it came apart.  It was no problem. Pressed the button and placed the extension arm to the right level.  Now, I was truly ready to use it, but before I use it I had to pair the wireless keyboard and my iPad Air (updated to the last iOS).  First, I could not figure out how to turn on the keyboard. I did not read the manual, but I eventually figured that I need to hold the on/off button for a few seconds to turn it on and off. Then I pressed the pairing button which connected easily to my iPad.  Used extensively the keyboard during my 10 hours flight. I wrote emails and made notes in preparations for my upcoming client meetings. The keyboard felt nice. It was not clunky and was a good size.  With my first Airbender 2.0, I had some problems with the keyboard freezing my iPad which this worked perfectly.  During my trip, the passenger next to me commented about the case too. He said it looks really nice.During the week and my flight back, the case was still working perfectly. So far, no problems. I took some pictures with iPhone 5s. These may not be the greatest pictures, but it will provide you with some sense of this great case. If you have iPad and wants it to be protected and a great wireless keyboard, you must consider the Newtrend Airbender Pro (NT610KR)!Durability~5  (so far, no issue to report)Functionality~5 (it has all of the options I would want)Quality~5  (so far it has been great and fun to use it)Protective Capability~5 (this is a fantastic case)Shipping of product~5  (the box is pretty cool too) ANSWERNOTFOUND",It feels very sturdy and nice looking,"(325, 362)"
B000VM60I8,great,How is the hardware?,"the issue with this package is that from the camcorder to the PC, the picture is quite good.  That is, their hardware is good and it shows up on the screen as a good picture.  So when you watch it live it looks good.  Now, the problem comes in when you record it using their encoders.  The package lets you save it avi or mp4 but when you play back, it's not quite as good as the signal coming from the camcorder.

I have tried another optical cable belonging to my brother and the sound quality seems much better.  I don't know if it's a flaw in the cable or just due to the production or what.  The cable DOES work and it is a decent cable, but it just does a lackluster job on the sound quality end, it seems.In the end I've just decided to use the TV speakers for now, while I decide what kind of receiver to get (one that has an HDMI hookup).

B000BKJZ9Q,accurate,How is the map?,"Recently picked this up to replace a dated, although fully functional Garmin GPS-V and WOW what a difference! The satellite acquisition is super fast and at least a full minute quicker than the GPS V. Route calculations, re-calculations and map redraw speeds are simply mind boggling in comaprison to the GPS V. I also like the fact that you can update the unit's already HUGE 700MB memory bucket with inexpensive SD cards.Accuracy: No GPS is perfect and I have had some ""interesting"" route suggestions by this(Same map data as the GPS V), but none have been dead on wrong. 99% of the time you can count on this device to get you where you need to be. This is more than I can say for the TOMTOM Go we use at work, which you consider yourself lucky if it can find itself out of your driveway.The voice prompts are clear and concise. You can even add various accents. I currently have mine set to the Australian female. (There are only female voices, by the way). The unit alerts you in plenty of time for you next turn, exit, etc. The unit also has a few other bells and whistles that I find more of a niche than neccessity, but all work well. Compared to my iPod Video 60GB, the MP3 audio is 95% as clean and the controls are very intuative. The photo viewer is a nice touch as well.All in all this is honestly THE best GPS out right now for mobile navigation.

B006QB1RPY,clear,How do you like the manual?,"January 22, 2013I purchased this from a local big box store as Amazon was out of stock at the time.I followed the very simple directions and it only took a few minutes for the router to set itself up and be operational. The web interface has a lot more features than most home users will need but you are not required to use them either if you follow the simple setup. I have Comcast and the router determined the network type and set itself up automatically.I do like how easy it is to create guest networks. This is a really great feature that you can add and delete them so quickly via the web interface.I looked at both N and AC routers and decided on the N due to the fact that the reviews on the AC, from Asus and other manufacturers were generally middle of the road to poor.

B00FEE7B1I,bad,How do you like the screen?,"I was shopping around for a Windows based tablet for the past 6 months.  Kept looking at the Microsoft Surface RT (didn't want to pay the price of the pro) and also looking here at ASUS and Lenovo.  When I saw the Venue come out I wanted to touch one so went to the Microsoft Store a few blocks from my office.  I spent about an hour going back and forth between the Suface 2 and the Venue.  The main reason was size and comparison between RT and Full Windows 8.1.  I wanted something that splits between a PC, Tablet, and eReader (huge Kindle fan).  After thinking about what my life would be like sitting on an Airplane and what would be more comfortable to work with I picked the Venue 8 Pro.  I have had this for about 4 days now (bought at Microsoft Store, price was the same as prime and I was in an instant satisfaction mode).What I like:1.  Size, this is large enough that the office tools, apps, and web browsing are functional2.  It keeps my Kindle on my night stand when I travel.  I was using my Windows Phone and it worked find but it was a bit small and this is much better and holds like my Kindle3.  It is full blown Windows, not RT so I can load my other apps on it4.  The disk space is good,  with 64G it leaves over 30G to use,  I added a 32G MicroSD card to it and can't think of how I will run out of space.5.  Full Windows from the start screen is familiar, don't need to learn anything new.  Not a huge fan of Windows 8 but on a tablet it works great.What I don't like:Configuring Windows 8.1 on a small device is a bit tedious, so need to be patient on the setups and get a stylus (I had one).The few comments on the start button being on the side really isn't an issue, a left swipe from the right side of the screen gets you to start very quickly.  So far battery is great, I did remove the dimming and put my own setting on.  I got alittle over 9 hours on the battery that way and other than international flights don't know when I wouldn't be in a position to charge it throughout the day.The screen is good, I added a bluetooth keyboard / case to this and still getting used to the keyboard.  The split keyboard on screen actually works well in the hand and I may toss the bluetooth keyboard.  I don't plan on writing documents on this and mostly for email, reading, and browsing.Already put Pandora on it, sounds OK with the speaker.  Have Sonos at home and have that installed as well as few other apps I like.  Really don't need thousands of apps and there are enough to make this fully functional for my use.The last point is I didn't buy an Apple because they just charge too much for the brand.  I actually had a significant amount of interest from the iPAD users who started to go look at reviews on this after they saw it.  $349 for a Full Windows 8 tablet with 64G, 8&#34; screen (Kindle form factor) is hard to ignore.Go ahead and buy it, you will like it for utility.

B007P4YAPK,sharp,How is the screen?,"I'll make this one short.Is my 5th tablet, I've had the iPad and 3 other Honeycomb android tablets plus a Kindle Fire. All Honeycomb tablets had issues, they sooner or later had to go back due to defective manufacturing and software glitches. The iPad is a solid performer in the hardware and software aspect but is made for people that like to be told what to do and not do with their devices... Apple has a sick way of doing that and they always leave you wanting more when you know they could have provided all those things they intentionally left out so next year they can introduce it in their new iPad and have you go crazy for the new little feature that your old iPad should have included for the premium you paid.Then comes a solid company like Asus and comes up with a brilliant idea of making ""Transformer"" tablets, no tablet is perfect and Asus is no exception but the TF300 is everything I want a tablet to be with some room for improvement but not so much you'll cry about it because other have it and you dont. ICS is a very solid OS and has much good to offer. The screen could be better but its more than adequate, plenty of memory for the price with room to grow like a Micro SD slot and with the optional keyboard dock you get a full size SD slot plus you get a full size USB port for attaching external storage devices if you really are one of those that carries movie and music collections around.There's many positive things about this tablet but the one that impresses me the most is ""optional"" keyboard dock that turns this thing into a mini 10"" notebook with a very usable keyboard and it closes and opens just like a notebook and it adds 5 extra hours of battery life. I use mine with a wireless USB mouse and it feels solid and reacts just as good as a good high performance notebook while performing many different task including watching HD movies. The combination of a touch screen and a ""real"" keyboard and mouse is a very awesome experience.The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it does have it's minor software glitches and the screen could have been better but all the pros overcome the cons very quickly and I would not change it for anything else at the moment.

The 4 ports are full, everything else is run through the wifi including the new Wii.  I port forward HTTP, FTP, SSH, Oracle, and Terminal Services through to statically assigned IP addresses and everything else is making use of the routers DHCP services.  In short -- I think it is getting a pretty good test!Setup was a breeze, but that is standard for Linksys routers I have found.  The instructions were clear and would allow an absolute idiot to set this up although I didn't need them being familiar with their other routers.I live in a largish apartment, and rather than being in a central location the router is squirreled away in the corner office on top of a desktop and below my TV - not ideal I know but the coverage throughout the apartment is always at maximum strength, is as fast as can be expected and I am happy.  I often play online games in my living room on the opposing side of the apartment without problems of laggyness.I first turned on the router in July 2007.

I then used that one to order another red one. It is that useful a device.The buttons have a nice positive click, the wheel is the ""clicking"" sort I prefer with detents in scroll mode and has a tilt function for horizontal scrolling.And if you need to move it from machine to machine, you can store the tiny USB dongle inside the mouse so it doesn't get lost.A winner from Logitech.[EDIT 10/4/13] I started to see false double-click behavior last week and so swapped out my three+ year old M305 with the one I bought for a spare back in November of 2011, which returned sanity to my mouse usage.Three years plus from a mouse that cost me less than $20 and which has been toted around in some very hostile conditions isn't bad. I don't know what has broken, but it gave good service until it did.I would not want to pay the prices I'm seeing for this unit of late. True, the current ""in stores"" model does not have the nice hinged buttons of this one, but a portable mouse is always going to get a beating and should be either armor plated or disposably inexpensive as a consequence.

Unlike the 3.5"" hard drive world, capacities are larger earlier in the external devices, but somehow the casing and enclosed bridge (in this case SATA to USB) make the physical size larger than an internal drive with case.  This one is still a little bigger, but really quite small.  It's awesome, frankly.  To have that much capacity in something you can store just about anywhere and you don't even have to mess around with a power cord.What I don't like - and I complain about this with all external hard drives - is the included software that they want you to install to do backups, etc.  As an advanced computer user, I think it's nonsense; even my mother should be able to use the drive without any software.  Of course you don't have to use it.  The thing that annoys me is that the drive - again, like all other externals nowadays - comes with a sleep timer set, in this case at 30 minutes, so I have to install the interface software to turn that off (necessary for my intended application), and then uninstall the software to get it off my system, but all software leaves a trace after its removal.If this is your first USB 3.0 peripheral, be aware that the port on the drive is unlike any USB 2.0 port, and thus will require a different cable if you need one longer than the included ~1m cable.  More industry stupidity, so they can overcharge for the first year or so.  Look for a cheap one on Amazon so you don't have to run out to Best Buy and pay 10x too much.  Interface cables are the one thing I believe in buying as cheap as possible - and thank God for Amazon in that respect.One more note in response to another review:  prices on non-solid state hard drives have been fluctuating a lot recently because of the Thai floods, and prices of electronics on Amazon always fluctuate.  I typically check all prices before buying anything, but still end up buying from Amazon 99% of the time.  I haven't seen Best Buy have a real deal in years.  They make their money off lies that their employees tell you, either because they have been brainwashed in to believing said lies or because of commission.  Do your own price comparison when the time comes to make a purchase.The only thing I don't love about this drive is an industry problem that's not going away any time soon, and I have to just stop complaining about it (later).  I give this a higher than average review because I was actually surprised - and impressed - with the physical size. ANSWERNOTFOUND",capacities are larger,"(590, 611)"
B007B4THOI,narrow,How is the angle?,"I don't understand the negative reviews on image quality and setup. It was straight-forward and simple to follow the menus and program automatic on and off times. The images are bright, sharp, and clear if you start with decent digital images. The typical image file from my point and shoot digital camera is about 1mb, and the images on this digital frame are beautiful. I especially like the fact that the image is good from almost any angle. You can see the pictures clearly from anywhere in the room. You don't need to be right in front of it.

B005FVNGRI,good,How is the player?,"I purchased the 4GB version along with a 16GB Micro SD card - so 20GB memory for about $55. I like the interface - the navigation is simple and consistent between menus. The documentation is not really complete as the music content on the external card can be accessed from the Music menu - not just the card menu. The only limitation I've found is that playlists can only be stored on the internal memory.What I really like though is that I can select MP3 folders from the external memory card and then select shuffle at any level. So I can shuffle the entire card, a folder for one artist, one genre, etc. Or I can select one album and play or shuffle that. It nearly eliminates the need for playlists which is great since the internal memory is somewhat limited.Sound is good in the car and with earbuds.

B00DVFLJDS,gorgeous,How did you like the display?,"I hesitated before ordering this tablet because of the bad reviews.... finally, the price was really good so I ordered one from Amazon (32G for $229). I have been using it since 4 days and everything seems to be working as expected.... I tested the touch screen using more than one test app and I found no issues.... also I didn't encounter any touch screen issues while using the device. I do have both android as well as Apple devices so I am not biased to anyone against the other... and to be honest, I was planning to buy the ipad mini with Retina display, but I didnt like its width and I HATED ITS PRICE !!!! so I bought this Nexus for less than half the price of the ipad mini (my 32G  Nexus 7 is $229 no Tax and no shipping while the 32G ipad mini is $550 including the Tax). I do believe that the ipad is more stable, more mature, looks nicer, and will out-perform this Nexus, but honestly for half the price I highly recommend this Nexus 7 .... I like this device: display is beautiful, performance is good (I updated to 4.4), and battery life is excellent.I am giving 4 starts because I believe that Asus should have done a little better job by reducing the huge top/bottom bezel or at least provide capacitive buttons and probably front speakers on this huge bezel in case if they decided to keep its size as is...I will update this review in case if I encounter any issues....

B0018ZDGAC,similar,How are the results?,"Sigma has a real winner here. This lens is unusual for a 50mm as they are typically rather small. This one is much larger than the Nikon/Canon variants (other than the Canon 1.2 of course!!!). But still, it is not THAT big. Feels real good on my D700. I also LIKE the 77mm filter size as that is somewhat of a standard filter size in Nikonland and I have them already! This compares favorably, for example, to the new Nikon 50 1.4 AFS as that takes an unusual filter size for Nikon shooters (58mm).Anyway, this lens is solidly constructed, as I would expect from a Sigma EX lens. It also focuses quickly, accurately, and quietly, with the well implemented HSM focusing system that Sigma has developed. It is also sharp, acceptably-so wide open, and razor sharp stopped down a bit. Nice bokeh. Combine this with a D700 or D3 and you have perhaps an incomparable low combo! You cannot believe the shots you can make with this lens and those Nikon bodies in very dim light. I like how the lens handles. Jeez, I just like everything about it!!!

B002MAPRYU,defective,How is the unit?,"I've had it around 3 months. I went to adjust the sound. It wouldn't work. Than I pushed really hard and the sound button imploded. I've had Apple Nano 2nd generation for over 2 years never a problem. I only bought this because I was bored. Price is cheap but if they only last 3 months the value is low.I'll try to warranty it but they'll probably blame on misuse.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++With a little threatening, they replaced it. So we'll give them credit for standing behind the warranty.  I have it sitting around because I just don't like the short battery life. My 4 year old Nano 2 goes for 12-15 hours compared to the 6-7 hours of this unit and I got tired of it always running out of batteries on me.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++I'm very satisfied with this unit with one exception. I only get approximately 7 hours of listening time. This is leaving the unit on at a fairly high volume and doing nothing more than listening to books. I subtracted 2 stars because battery life is important to me and I've already run out a few times.I'm using it for Audible exclusively. I had a Ipod Nano 2nd generation and prefer the Sandisk Clip+ unit. This review is for Audible Users, others probably won't be interested in it. I was looking through the reviews and couldn't find a review that would describe the interaction of this unit with Audible Useage.1. Very small and compact- The unit is really tiny. All I want to do is listen to books. The screen is small enough to see easily but doesn't take up space so the buttons are larger.2. Great Sound-This unit sounds as good or better than my Ipod.3. Simple Navigation buttons-Took less than 5 minutes to learn.4. On off button which I use as Pause too. It is well located to the top directly over where the headset plugs in, I can find it by feel and don't need to see it. So it is convenient to find an use. When you turn off the book while running it comes back on at the same point still running. The time to turn on and start playing the book is less than 5 seconds. I've found that this feature is key to my enjoyment of using the unit with Audible. No fumbling through the other buttons to find pause.5. Convenient Lock mechanism, which I never use, just push the home button for 5 seconds. No cumbersome hard to find slide mechanisms. Where this unit blows away the Ipod units is that there is no touch sensitive wheel. Everything is push button. Without that sensitive wheel, I've never had to lock the unit. I had an Ipod which used the wheel which is sensitive so I always had to lock it. Big pain in the neck.7.Sound controls are on the side, again push button and stiff enough not to trigger by accident. I prefer this to the ipod system.8. It organizes each book into it's own separate folder so it's an extra click but your books are organized together9. When part 1 of a book ends it automatically go to the next part.But won't open a new book. This is advantageous because if you fall asleep with Audible running than it runs to the end of the part of the book you are on, than the next part (if you aren't on the last part) and than it goes to sleep. This can reduce battery drain.IE listen before going to bed.10. Uses the standard Mini USB connector (the one that's bigger) so you can charge and Sync with the standard one used on many devices. I just bought 2Technocel MV9MCDUO-SP OEM Sprint Dual USB Port Car Charger - Blackalong with 2Dual Micro USB / Mini USB Splitter Cable - Charge up two Devices (One Micro and One Mini USB) Once From a Single USB Port - Ideal for mp3 players, Digital Cameras, Smartphones (Android, BlackBerry, HTC, Samsung), GPS, and More. This gives me 2 micro USB and 1 Mini USB in my Autos. With 1 of the Micro USB being rapid charge. I love devices with standard Micro USB connection. By the way I have aDMMR: Dual mini USB and Micro USB to USB Sync and Charge Cable (Retractable)at my office and it charged and transferred data flawlessly with this unit.I have a mini usb connection at home that I use for my Card Reader also transferred data and charged it.  Hurray. It's standard Micro USB.12. Fast Forward and Rewind are as good if not better than the Ipod and convenient. Actually the Forward and reverse start slowly, than speed up the more time the button is held. This is advantageous because it allows for both slight f forward/Reverse and extreme f forward/reverse14.Expandable Memory using Micro SDHC. It was just so inexpensive I bought a 8gb MicroSDHC on Amazon for $6.00+ delivered8GB Sandisk MicroSDHC Memory Cardthis one is class 4 don't buy the class 2 might be too slow. With how cheap memory is it's better to buy the 4gb unit and upgrade instead of the 8gb unit. 4 gb does hold alot of books.15. Convenient Eject system from computer- I kept looking for the eject on my Windows Machine to disconnect. Finally I went to the manual. Turns out that as long as you aren't synchronizing you just pull the Unit out with no damage. Very convenient.15. You can listen to it while it's charging.The glitches:1. Battery life. Audible Playback only at fairly high volume using headphones. I only got around 7 hours. my Ipod Nano gets 14 hours. I had to take 2 stars off because that would be a deal breaker for many.2. For Audible can only use the Audible Manager.Remember Audible books are DRM Protected so you need the Audible Manager to decrypt and put on the Clip+3. Their is no way to organize the order of the books. It goes in Alphabetical Order (If I'm wrong please tell me how to do it in comments.4. Itunes tried to take over so I had to remove ITunes but I think that there is a setting or way that I could disableItunes from turning on automatically. Also my original default was through Itunes. Just be aware there may be issues withItunes and Audible Manager on your machine. Probably you can get around it.5. The books are grouped by Books. So if you are in part 1 of a book it'll play part 2 but won't go to the next book.Since it doesnt' go automatically. You have to stop and fiddle with it. This could be inconvenient for example if you are driving. Unfortunately once the book is organized on the machine their is no way to change the order. I have some books where it decided to put the Part 2 at the top and part 1 below. I tried accessing the drive in MTP mode which turns it into a hard drive. In Mtp Mode it showed as in order. So there was no way to fix a problem that doesn't exist when accessing the unit as a hard drive. To find the Mtp and MSC mode it's simple Press the home button&lt;Settings&lt;System Settings&lt;USB Mode&lt; For loading books Audible manager will only recognize in MSC Mode.6. I'd prefer that it used a Micro USB connector which is used on most newer phones.7. Controls are very small. I have to hold it in front of me to use all the buttons except the on off and volume button.8. When Fast rewinding or forward my Ipod used to allow me to hear the words so it was easier to find the spot. This is totally silent.9. If I turn unit off and than back on sometimes it will resume at the beginning of the chapter that I was on. But I had the same problem with my IPOD. So I don't believe it's a Clip+ specific problem.If you like this review please rate it as helpful.

B00D5T3QK4,awesome,How is the battery?,"The Anker Astro E5 is a great external battery for anyone's Apple and Android Device. The Astro E5 size is exactly the same size as it predecessor, the Astro E4. The weight of it is pretty heavy holding it in your hand but not anything that is noticeable if you have a bunch of stuff in a bag with this battery in it. The on/off button is quite easy to press and easily pressed if it is stuffed into a bag. The flashlight in the external battery is a big plus. It is a bright LED light that works well if the power is out or looking for something in the night. The light is easily turned on because of the easily pressed on/off buttons. The flashlight is activated by pressing 2 times fast on the on/off button. This battery has 2 USB ports. One is 5 volts at 2 amps and the other is 5 volts at 1 amp. There are 4 LED's that tell how much power the battery pack has left for charging other devices. The battery has a smooth, shiny, reflective and stylish finish which looks awesome. The finish on the battery also attractions a lot of fingerprints which could make the battery look bad if not cleaned every so often.This battery has a massive 15000mah lithium ion battery in it that is packed in a small casing. This battery is smaller than most other external batteries I have researched in the past which is ideal for packing in a small bag. I use this battery to charge my iPhone 5 and my iPod touch 5. I can charge both these devices simultaneously.This product is ideal for someone who travels a lot and uses a smartphone for their business when traveling. This battery is also good for people who go camping and are not around power that watch movies and play games on their device for long periods of time. Other than the buttons being easily pressed this is the perfect external battery for those looking into buying one to use for a long trip or power your friends device and keep your devices charged in case of a black out.The Anker Astro E5 is closely comparable to the Astro E4.Anker Astro E4 13000mAh External Battery Pack Portable Power Bank Charger for iPhone 5, 4S, 4, iPad 4, 3, 2, Mini, iPods; Samsung Galaxy S4, S3, S2, Note 2; HTC One, EVO, Thunderbolt, Incredible, Droid DNA; Motorola ATRIX, Droid; Google Nexus 4, Nexus 7... (This has a 13000mah lithium ion battery) Both of these batteries look identical from the looks to the locations of the ports but the Astro E5 has a 15000mah battery that puts it over the top of the Astro E4.Overall the Anker Astro E5 is a great external battery that can charge your smartphone to 100% and do it again 6-8 more times and has a modern look most smartphones have today. You won't have to worry about your phone dying for more than a week when using this external battery.So far i have charged my iPhone 5 twice and it still has 4 LEDS.Another Update: i have charged my ipod touch 2 times and my iPhone 5 3 times and it now has 1 LED and can still charge my devices.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.

B00DVFLJDS,clear,How do I send a text message?,"A local brick and mortar store in my area started selling these early, so I picked one up on my way home from work yesterday.  This is my first tablet, although I have friends with iPads, iPad minis and the original Nexus 7, all of which I've used before.  To me, this device blows them all away and for the price you can't go wrong.I got the 16GB model because I'm not one of those people who stores a lot of content locally on the device.  I usually keep about 50 apps installed, some of them games, and there's plenty of storage for all of that.  The rest of my media is either streaming or stored in the cloud.  There's no microSD expansion, but honestly, I don't really miss it so far.  Cloud storage shared between your various devices is the future, and so far it's working well on this tablet as well as on my phone.The screen is straight up gorgeous, and content looks clean and crisp.  I'm running mine with auto-brightness and it seems to always pick a good happy medium between visibility and battery savings, so no complaints there.  Small text is easy to read and Netflix videos look great.  The dual speakers are loud enough, but they don't personally blow me away.  They do go to full volume without any noticeable distortion, however, so that's good.  If you're using this tablet for playing music you may be slightly disappointed, but for watching YouTube videos and movies they're perfectly acceptable.The battery life so far has been stellar.  Mine came out of the box yesterday with a 59% charge, and by the end of the night (about 7 hours later) with HEAVY use I was down to 19%.  The battery is technically smaller than the previous generation's battery, but this new chipset uses that power more efficiently and the device sips power in standby mode so this should last you 2 days on a charge unless you're constantly streaming full HD movies to it.  It does support wireless charging using the Qi standard, but I haven't tested that out yet although I fully plan on getting a wireless charging pad soon.Overall system performance has been nice and snappy.  It's my understanding they're using OpenGL for the system UI now, and all the animations and transitions feel much smoother than they ever have before.  Just swiping through and navigating around Android 4.3 feels great.  iOS may still be a bit smoother, but the difference to me is negligible after this most recent update to the Android OS.And my personal favorite feature is the name itself; This is a Nexus device and will come with all the developer goodies that I've come to love.  This is my 3rd Nexus device and I love how easy it is to flash custom software to it.  Within 20 minutes of getting this thing home yesterday I had unlocked the bootloader, flashed a custom recovery and backed up my current ROM before rooting it.  It's only a matter of days until we get custom ROMs coming out for it with cool features added in.  I'm personally looking forward to using the PIE controls and getting HALO running on it.If you're in the market for a tablet that's not too big to be portable, and that sits at a killer price point for the screen/performance that you get, the new Nexus 7 is a no-brainer.

B00004T8R2,pleasing,How is the sound?,"It's pretty unbelievable at first, but these inexpensive headphones really give you quite a bit of use for your money! They connect easily to MP3 players and similar devices; and the bass is awesome just as everyone says it is. Moreover, at this price you simply can't go wrong.If you listen to a CD or MP3 player daily, I would recommend buying a few sets of these. They do go south eventually and you won't have to worry about waiting for another pair to ship.These are also much, much better than earbud headphones; the earbuds always make my ears hurt! The over the head strap is fairly comfortable and that alone makes this a much better choice than the earbud type of headphones.In addition, use these for young kids who may not be all that gentle with them. That way if they break or get lost you won't be out too much money.I highly recommend these headphones; they may not be the very best out there (after all, they're not Sennheiser, Skull Candy hesh headphones or Skullcrushers) but the sound quality is really quite good and you can't beat the price.

B004KKZ0HO,poor,How is the image quality like?,"The title speaks for itself:  This proves to me that Panasonic has not done any really relevant and ground-breaking research in developing this camera (and others in the same category) because their imaging sensor is horrendeous.  The photos are full of colourful specks of noise and are very smudgy and blurry, even at ISOs as low as 400!  At 800, 1600 they are a disaster!  The exposure of videos is poor and overall, low light performance is also very poor.  I took a photo of my livingroom under tungster/halogen lighting which came out OK but again with much noise.  Then I made a video of the same room right afterwards under the same lighting conditions and the video was too dark.  This camera also has no exposure compensation for videos.  I read the manual and it clearly indicates that videos are strictly in automatic mode with no exposure control at all by the photographer.  You are at the mercy of the camera.  The Canon PowerShot SX220/230 HS DOES have exposure compensation for videos FYI...The only good thing is that the videos are smooth because of a fast 60fps (interlaced i - not progressive p though).  And having a GPS is just a gimmick and a toy to fool consumers, and does not make the picture quality of this camera any more ""attractive"" or in any way better.Having a Leica lens is not enough because a good digital camera also needs a good image sensor.  The actual sharpness and noise level in the image is determined largely by the sensor.  One can have the best lens in the world and have a poor sensor and the resulting photos and videos will be horrible.  This camera is not worth it!

B00B0TMWTW,great,How is the grip?,"First, the price is nice, if it were $10-15 more I would rank it a 3, as in, ""it's okay"" or better but a bit too pricey for what it is. However, at this price, ""I like it"" a lot. If it is durable it may earn my ""I love it"" -- especially since I will probably use it pretty hard (8-12 hours a day, in and out of a laptop bag nearly every work day), and since it is a $15 mouse I won't be all that careful about it.It is my main mouse for a desktop replacement laptop, both travel with me to work most days. So, I will see how it holds up and update if it wares out or develops problems - if I don't update that means that it is still going strong and I still stand by this review. If it lasts into the 5 year range I will update and probably change it to 5 stars.Next the review points:Pros:To start, I like this mouse. It feels good in my medium-large man hands. The grip on the thumb side feels good; although, I had to push mine into place as it was peeling on arrival and it continues to be somewhat loose or prone to getting pulled out of place, it sits to high above the surrounding plastic [Edit, this continues to be ""loose""]. (I do wish there was a thin strip on the pinky side.)The adjustable DPI will probably be nice for some light game play and some situations, but I generally just keep it on the lowest setting. But having the option is a bonus.The mouse is nice and responsive and I have not noticed any lags (I'm using it on an Ivy Bridge I5 3230m in a Toshiba Satellite L series, Windoze 8 and will be dual booting Kubuntu, when I get a chance to set it up; if I don't update the mouse works fine as a native in Ubuntu as I expect it will [edit, confirmed, works in every distro I've played around with lately (all Debian/Ubuntu forks)]).The back and forward rocker works great and is also very nice to have.The mouse moves smoothly and works on every reasonable surface I've tried it on, including the number pad on the side of my laptop keyboard, which is nice.Range is good, as advertised about 15 feet through walls, etc and about 25 feet in the perfect situation (in the same room or outside).Cons:I wish it had a real off switch since it wakes the Laptop up on button click, until the mouse shuts itself off; you have to take the dongle out when you are transporting the laptop or shut off the wake up settings.This boarders on nitpicking and is related to the previous point: I wish it had a clip like some Logitech mice do so that it clips to the back of my screen and when clipped it shuts off the mouse so that it doesn't wake up the pc -- [edit, I really, really wish that it had such a clip]. This is a good thing because it protects the mouse by ensuing that it is in the padded case with the laptop, rather than just thrown into the bag or outside pocket to get banged, bumped, and (maybe) broken. I really don't understand why anyone would manufacture a wireless mouse without this feature. It just makes good business sense and is relatively cheap.Finally, the mouse does feel a bit less high end. As I mentioned the grip pad for the thumb was out when I took it out of the box, but other things don't quite fit right. One corner of the battery cover sticks out and is a bit stiff to remove (feels like you might break it), but hopefully I'll only replace the battery ever year or so.Overall the mouse feels just solidish. As in, somehow I suspect it isn't as durable is my partners beat up 3-4 year old Logitech that is still going strong. But only time will tell and that Logitech was almost twice the price.Nit-picking (in order of importance):The scrolling wheel is a little high and I wish it was closer to the tip of my middle finger.This boarders on obnoxious nitpicking, but the material you touch is that slick glossy plastic and I wish it had a bit of texture.The slick material feels, sweaty or something, I don't know, I don't like touching it as much as other mouse textures -- yeah, it is nitpicky, I know.At this point I strongly recommend this product. I like it a lot right now for its price, but if it proves durable that may make me love it (as in 5 stars).If you are a cheap-skate like me and looking for a good mouse, I think this is it. If you are a high-end type, this isn't it.I will update when the battery dies, currently it has one AA Eneloop that was fully charged when installed.[Edit, a month after purchase, I like it okay, but I think the 4 stars will stick and I very much wish that I'd gotten one with a off switch and/or a clip -  I would've payed $10-15 more for these things.] ANSWERNOTFOUND",The grip on the thumb side feels good,"(863, 900)"
B005KOZNBW,great,How is the interface structured?,"I bought this product to replace a previous WD TV live player without wifi. This player is well worth the money. Setup was simple. As soon as I got it hooked up and connected to my home network it automatically updated the firmware itself. If you have used a WDTVLive player in the past, the new interface is really nice. You have a lot of options for customizing your view settings. This is very nice if you have a large media library that you are sharing over your home network. I believe the ROKU may have this product beat if you are only looking to stream media off of the internet, but if you are primarily concerned with streaming media on your home network, this is hands down the best option to do so. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the new interface is really nice,"(288, 320)"
B0007Y794O,much well,What is the difference in image?,"So, this certainly isn't an L lens, however given the pricepoint and image quality, you can't go wrong.  I've used this lens at a number of motorsports events where the image stabilization is a must have.  Before using this lens, images were blurry and just as many were bad as good.  With the IS turned on, things look great.  Additionally, being able to shoot in lower light has allowed me to take some shots that might have otherwise gotten away.  I'd buy again, though this time I'd add the lens hood to it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",images were blurry and just as many were bad as good,"(230, 282)"

B0009GZSSO,excellent,What do you think about detail?,"I bought this camera based on some of the reviews and because I didn't want to shell out $1000 for an DSLR. I got it home and started playing with it.Sure, it's a decent camera, but it was obvious that I would eventually want to upgrade to an DSLR.All things considered, there are a couple of ways to think about this camera:One is that it is a relative bargain for what it offers. High resolution, relatively fast shooting speed (compared to other point and shoot cameras), high quality video capability (amazingly good), image stabilized lens (low light shots were still blurry), 12X zoom, macro capability in an all-in-one package. You don't really need any addons except for more memory and a case.The other side is that it is expensive. $450-500 is expensive for anything, and this camera is no exception.For me, I believed the latter. Since I was spending $500, why not  spend a few hundred more (ok 500 more) and just get the Digital Rebel XT?Anyway, after battling the 2 sides for a day or so, I returned the camera and bought the digital rebel XT. My advice is to definitely go for the DSLR, they are in different leagues.The S2 performed poorly in low light. It has an overly complex menu system. The DSLR has more buttons. I like buttons. They are much more accessible than a nested menu system.The S2 was slow, offering 1.5 fps (max) while my DSLR has 3 fps. I found the wait to take my next shot with the S2 agonizingly slow, with the flash much longer.Strangely, the S2 has a lens cap that just won't stay on. Perhaps one of the weakest aspects of the camera. I was holding the camera still, and the cap just slid off to the floor. Be prepared to lose the cap eventually.The S2 has a cheap plastic silver look to it. It looks like the ""flavor of the month"". I'm not sure why so many electronics are plastic silver. Guess it's the trend. I'd much rather have black. I believe the S2 is as heavy as or even heavier than the Digital Rebel XT.Bottom line is the camera may be one of the best sub-DSLR camera out there but it doesn't come close to the DSLR . Not by a long shot. ANSWERNOTFOUND",amazingly good,"(506, 520)"
B0074BW614,positive,What is your impression of the product?,"Cannot believe what we have been missing. We are a tech family, and have been Ipad fans from the get go, have owned all three versions. Never even considered the Kindle until I saw one with no glare to read. So we thought for the price and Amazons great return policy why not try the new HD out and see how it is for reading.OH MY WORD......(mouth open) it is awesome. Reading books on this is like night and day to our Pads. The screen is rich and clear, the abilities to adjust things is great and love the being able to download books through Amazon right to the Kindle. Okay, that in itself was just grand, however being able to watch our movies through HDMI cords to our TV and download and shop with Amazon with such ease was such a nice treat. :)Yes, we still love our Pads and they have their own place, but I like that I can now keep my Pad at home and tote the Kindle around with me with so much ease..it is light weight, small and perfect for my purse. We like it so much we ordered another 7"" today, but with 32gb this time for me and hubby will use the 16gb one. We were waiting for the Mini Pad, but once we saw the specs and the screen pixelation, we came right to Amazon and ordered another Kindle Fire HD...Go figure..Goes to show you good things CAN come in small packages!! It's light, fits in my hand and I can still do the daily stuff I used to do on Pad with it. Oh and did I mention some of the Apps are wayyyy cheaper on the Kindle than Apple? Same apps too...yes I do realize they do not need retina and such for the Kindle, but we don't need that for a lot of the apps we use anyways.Get it...it works, it can go with you easier and it ROCKS!!

B000I68BD4,high,Is the review rating not good ?,"The good news is that these earbuds sound pretty good.  Because they come with several different sizes of soft rubber earpieces, they are more comfortable than the buds shipped with most players.The bad news is that these buds do nothing to reduce sound.  If you are planning on using them on the bus, for instance, you will find that background noise is no different from using the usual cheap phones.Construction on these is really flimsy.  The cord is the thickness of a piece of embroidery thread.  With daily use, I don't expect them to last much more than a month.For comparison, I have previously used theShure E2c Sound Isolating EarphonesandKoss SPARKPLUG - Stereo In Ear Ear Plugsphones.  Both provided far superior noise reduction; the Shure qualify as a deluxe set of earplugs, very nice on airplanes.  The Shure provided much better sound quality, the Koss was about the same sound quality.  Both were better construction (though both were still broken within a year).  The Koss was about equally comfortable; the Shure was much more comfortable, due both to better design and a wider selection of earpieces.  Currently Amazon is listing the Koss for $13 and the Shure for about $70. Both are better buys. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The good news is that these earbuds sound pretty good .,"(0, 54)"
B0027VT6V4,clear,How is the speaker clear?,"I was surprised at how cheap these speakers sounded after having read the positive reviews.  The features are neat, but the sound quality is poor enough for me to hassle with repacking these things and send them back.  The sub is clumsy and the main speakers are tinny and brittle sounding.

B001FA1O18,much well,How good is the camera of the nook?,"For anyone who, like me is new to using an iPod, you will be glad you have this one.  The camera works well and luckily, many coffee shops have free WiFi, so you can stay connected just about any time you go out.The only real drawbacks is that you have to have WiFi to place calls.  On the plus side, the camera is excellent and the sound quality is also quite good.A good product and it is even better if you have pre-paid telephone service. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the camera is excellent,"(301, 324)"
B001UEBN42,more,How high can the volume be?,"I bought this speaker because my Sony Vaio S has ridiculously quiet internal speakers.  It had the best reviews at the lowest price point, so I thought &#34;why not?&#34;First of all, it is a very classy-looking device, with the matte black plastic exterior and a splash of red on the drum.  The aesthetics remind me of an HTC EVO.  It is approximately the size of a tangerine when it's closed, which is a perfectly portable size.This thing can get extremely loud.  Even outdoors the sound travels pretty far and watch out when turning up the volume all the way inside.  I was wrong to expect so much from such a small device, but it is important to note that these speakers are very tinny.  Unfortunately, I can't use these for my personal listening because they absolutely despise bass.If you're looking to buy speakers to improve the sound on your laptop, look elsewhere!  Otherwise, these are well-made speakers with ample volume for portable media players where sound quality isn't much of an issue. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This thing can get extremely loud,"(430, 463)"
B005JN9310,bright,How is the monitor?,"This monitor is very crisp and a pleasure to look at. I actually watch video on this monitor all the time as it is a better picture than my TV. I think a good monitor is a necessity and this one is both good quality and inexpensive. The only thing I do not like is the sound bar doesn't come with the monitor and it doesn't work all that great after I installed it. It was a clever idea that they didn't follow through with very well. But still, the monitor is great. I use it on my Mac Mini. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the monitor is great,"(446, 466)"
B00009R6WY,excellent,How would you rate the sharpness of the image with the lens?,"While this lens will allow you to shoot in very low light, the resulting images will be very soft.  It sharpens up nicely by f/4, but there are several zoom lenses (e.g. 24-105mm f/4L) that can match it at that aperture.  While quick, the auto focus is not very accurate.  I spent a lot of time dialing in the AF micro-adjustment on my camera (7D), and while I was able to improve the average case, the variance was just too large to yield an acceptable ""keeper"" rate. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the variance was just too large to yield an acceptable,"(399, 453)"
B0088CJT4U,strong,How was the connection?,"I love the quick setup, the gigabit connections, and the dual band wireless. So far I've used the 5 Ghz band for my work PC, 2.5 Ghz for everything else. Both the wireless and wired connections have been rock solid, better than what I can say for my cable service provider.I don't have any so far; time will tell whether reliability stacks up to the name brands.I studied many different brands that are available in the market now, and broke with a significant brand loyalty to take a chance on a lesser-known (unknown to me) brand. Wireless routers are not necessarily a commodity item, but they are getting closer to each other in terms of features and differentiation. Price and durability seem to be the big differentiation factors now. So far I am very happy with this purchase; time will tell if reliability is up to par.

B001G1ZPV6,comfortable,What do you think about grip?,"I use this with my Nikon D7000 and an off label battery.  This grip fits perfect, feels good in your hands, is exactly compatible with my camera, and looks just like the Nikon grip.  The wheel that you use to tighten works fine, but you can jiggle it back and forth.  This does not affect how it fits at all.  It doesn't mean that the grip is coming loose, its just how it is. It comes with an optional insert for AA batteries if you don't happen to have a second lithium battery charged.  I also like how it has the shutter button, AE-L/FE-L button, and front and rear dials as well as directional buttons to control the menus while the camera is vertical.I honestly did not know if it would be a fully compatible grip for that price but I was pleasantly surprised.  I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quality yet inexpensive grip.  It really gives your camera a professional look.

B000N99BBC,several,How to operate the device?,"The TP-Link TL-SG1005D switch is a faster, inexpensive and reliable way to add more 10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet ports to a network. The TP-Link TL-SG1005D comes with 5 Ethernet ports, any of them can be designated as WAN and the rest will act as LAN ports. It's totally plug & play, and it detects when a device connected to a port is active or inactive, and consequently will put the inactive port idle until needed again, reducing the power consumption to an 80% compared to other switches in the market. It also discovers if the device connected to any of the ports is 10, 100, or 1000 Mbps and acts accordingly.It can be used with any router, or directly with a modem. I'm using it together with theTP-LINK TL-PA511 KIT AV500 Powerline Gigabit Adapter Starter Kit, up to 500Mbpsto provide broadband Internet to all the wired devices in my office, and it's like having a second router without paying the cost of it.

B00DVFLJDS,better,What is your feeling?,"I got one that was an ""open box"" item and the volume stopped working - the buttons and even settings wouldn't change the volume which had been set to the lowest setting (mute).  I tried turning off but then it didn't turn back on.  Took it back and it was replaced with a brand new one!Now I've had it for a while and have 3 accounts setup, one for myself, one for the wife and one restricted account for my 5 yr old.  The wife mainly watches videos (YouTube), son plays games and I play and surf.  Response is great although our internet connection is at tops 6Mbs so there are times when something that needs internet access may lag a bit.  I noticed one app that I play on my HTC One S always complains about the connection when I use the HTC phone, but on this tablet it just runs smoothly without every complaining - odd since they use the same WiFi connection.  The tablet response is good.The Android OS on this tablet is simple compared to my phone which has the HTC Sense version - not that the phone is ""hard"", but it may be why the phone seems a lot less responsive than this tablet.If you used any of the other OS (iOS, Win8, Firefox, etc...) then you will find the controls somewhat familiar.  Although there will be differences, they won't keep you from using the tablet.  You still have the apps you can download - some are free and some are paid apps.The volume control issue on the initial tablet seems to happen a bit as this one did the same, but I found out I could just change user accounts and it will work again - odd, but hopefully there will be an update that will prevent that from happening at all.Overall I am happy with the purchase and although there are a few things I wish it had (like expandable memory slot for a SD card for one, HDMI output for another), I think it's a great, fast and nice size for our first tablet.Update: Still have issue with ""mute"" getting stuck and having to swap accounts to get audio volume to function again.  But now also have an issue where the notification pull down bar (or whatever you want to call it) appears as we try to launch apps, swipe, or do anything.  We are having to power off and back on before it will work again.  Whatever they did with the latest release appears to have made the tablet worst than better and I've adjusted my rating accordingly.Update2: With the install of 4.4 KitKat, the screen problems appear to be gone now.  I haven't been using Mute a lot lately so not sure if that issue is also gone.Update3: And the problem is back!  Put a video on YouTube title Ematic vs Nexus 7.  The Ematic is a quad-core for $80 and in my opinion a better buy since it works (at least for now).  I'm going to see if Asus will take their paper weight back and give a refund.  This would be great if it worked correctly.Update4: Tablet's been with Asus for over two weeks.  RMA says waiting for customer confirmation ""swap"" so I called to find out what that meant and was told I will receive an email when Asus decides what to offer me.  Not a good experience at all.  You take a chance with these tablets that they will not work and you'll be stuck paying to send them back to Asus and wait for them to decide ""what to offer you"".Update4.1: May 30th received the replacement.  Asus sent a notice saying they shipped it and to check the ""courier"" site for updates but only listed ""TRUCKING"" as the courier with no tracking info.  On May 29th Fed Ex left a message saying they will be delivering a package that required a signature - that would have been hard to arrange if we were in a situation where no one would be home.  The item shipped from CA and not TX so I figured it must be a replacement unit and I was right as the serial # is different.  So far the replacement seems to be working.

B001202C44,amazing,What strange speaker?,"I paired these with an ancient Pioneer VSX-D411 5.1 Amp. For those of you worried that you need a new amp to go with these speakers, the answer is not really. The speakers are still great. I'll eventually upgrade the amp to get a HDMI capable one for the losless/HD sound. But for now these speakers are wonderful.The center speaker is amazing, you really can hear the actors voices clearly over loud music or effects. The rear speakers are very pronounced, you can hear background noise very well and get a better sound stage. For $400 (at the time of this review) you can't beat these speakers. I went into a BOSE store this weekend and all of their speakers sounded just as good as these, except these speakers only cost $400.The only negative I'd say is the subwoofer is to me, huge. Others said it was small, I guess that is relative. While the sattelite speakers are definitely small, the subwoofer is not what I would call small and difficult to place.Also, others said the speakers are difficult to mount to a wall. I don't think so at all. They may have missed that there are several screw options on the back. (I actually bothered to read the instructions). I mounted my speakers to the wall with no problems.For a medium to small room, these speakers are perfect. If you have a very large room you may want to consider more powerful speakers and amp.

That's just a personal thing, I'm sure, if you have no qualms then there is no problem. I didn't purchase the case as much for protection but when I realized how thin the mini is, I felt I needed something more sturdy. I bought an otter box which I normally hate and use it instead.

B002JPITXY,exceptional,What is the sound quality?,"Zune HD or iPod touch? Many people may start comparing this product to the iPod touch, but there are many aspects of PMP (portable media player), including the price (you get 16GB for one-hundred-sixty dollars, where for an iPod, you get 8GB for two-hundred-twenty dollars), that make the Zune HD a better choice and a strong competitor with today's leading PMP's.||>>APPEARANCEWhen I first opened up my Zune box and took it out, I was amazed. The Zune is extremely light and durable. The brushed metal back to the Zune gives it an industrial, yet sleek look. And since the screen is OLED, you can barely see where the screen boundaries are on the device. Overall, this probably one of the best looking devices I've ever seen (and I've seen tons of PMP's).||>>EASE OF USEThe user interface is amazing. It's definitely the best UI I've seen in a while. On the whole screen, there are options for music, pictures, videos, podcasts, internet, marketplace, social, and settings. Each sub-menu after that is pretty much the same. For music, you can view the music by artists, albums, genres, or songs (just a list of the 500 songs or whatever). You can switch between these different viewing options by swiping it to the left or right. The Zune performs these actions flawlessly.||>>INTERNET BROWSERAlong with all the other features packed into this device, the Zune sports a great browser. According to some sources, the browser is a slightly modified version of Internet Explorer 6. It seems pretty outdated, but many of the websites I go to have a mobile version that works just as well. Overall, loading pages is sometimes fast, and sometimes slow. It really depends on wi-fi network you're on. I'm pretty impressed with the quality of the web browser in terms of scrolling, and typing in text (the on-screen keyboard is great). The only thing I wish the Zune had was YouTube support, but with all of the music I have, I can manage not going on YouTube.||>>PORTABILITYThis devices is extremely light. It weighs around 70 grams, while the iPhone 3GS weighs about 150 grams. The devices is about 2 inches wide and 4 inches tall, with a screen that's 3.25 inches diagonally. The perfect dimension make the Zune extremely easy to carry around with me wherever I go, and also perfect for holding in my hand. I recommend buying a case (Incipio Feather Case for Zune HD (Black)) for this device.||>>SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality on this device is much better than the iPod touch. All my friends have iPods or iPhones, and even they say that my Zune sound quality blows theirs away. There are many different EQ settings for the music; acoustic, classical, electronic, hip hop, jazz, pop, and rock. I would probably say acoustic and pop are the most well-balanced options on the device, but different people have different ears. You might like different EQ settings, not to mention different headphones have different sound quality too.||>>BATTERY LIFEThe battery life on this device is a little bit better than the average PMP. With the brightness on low, wireless off, and the volume at 15 out of 30, I could probably get about 15 hours of battery life. The battery life also, depends on the bitrate of the movies or songs that you're listening to, as higher bitrates mean lower battery life. Most of my songs are 320 kbps, which is fairly high, so my battery life approximations may or may not be accurate.||>>SCREEN QUALITYThe OLED screen on this device is AMAZING. The resolution is 480x272, which isn't true HD resolution, but you can output HD video with the dock, which is sold separately. The colors on the screen are extremely bright and vivid, and the blacks are extremely dark. And the thing about OLED screens is that when they're displaying black pixels, the screen simply isn't being lit up at those pixels. So, having a lot of black really saves a lot of battery life, not to mention the whites look much, much better on OLED screens then any other screen. HOWEVER, if you're displaying a lot of white, the battery life drains a little faster than usual, which doesn't really matter that much because most of the menus are black anyway. If I was stuck on an island with nothing but my Zune HD and a couply of movies, I would be happy. :)||>>HEADPHONE QUALITYThe headphones that come with the device are pretty good. The only problem that I have with them is the bass response, so if you're an audiophile like myself, then you'll probably want to get new, better headphones. The headphones themselves are built extremely well and last a long time (longer than the generic Apple headphones). Also, the ear buds have little magnets on the ends of them which is kind of cool.||>>VERSATILITYThis device can play music, pictures, videos, podcasts (for free from the Zune Marketplace), browse the internet, download songs (and albums), and run some apps. So overall, this device has a pretty good range of things it can do. However, there isn't any integrated speaker, so you won't be able to watch videos or listen to music without headphones or separate speakers.||>>APPSThe apps selection is pretty limited. At the time of this review, there are probably only about 40-50 apps, most of which are simple 2D games. But they have a Facebook app, email app, and a twitter app, which I find quite useful at times.||>>SOFTWAREI've used iTunes before and I have to say, the Zune software totally blows iTunes out of the water. The interface is just so much faster. It looks nicer, instead of those bland Excel spreadsheets. When you're playing a song, the background automatically changes into a collage of different albums but that band, similar artists, artists photos, and some other stuff. Overall, the software is excellent, and really adds to the Zune experience.||>>MUSIC SUBSCRIPTIONS OPTIONSFor one-hundred-forty dollars a year, you can buy a Zune PASS. The Zune Pass is a subscription services that allows you to download an UNLIMITED amount of music for the time you're subscribed, along with 10 additional songs per month that you can keep forever. So, if you buy a 1-year subscription to the Zune Pass, you can download unlimited songs for a year, keep them on you computer, Zune, or Windows phone, and then listen to them whenever you want. Then, at the end of the subscription, you can download 120 of those songs to keep forever, even when you aren't subscribed. And if you stay subscribed, you can just continue like nothing ever happened, and then at the end of the 2 years, you can download 240 songs from the collection. Having the freedom to download as many songs as I want until my Zune gets full is really fun, and I would really recommend a Zune Pass to anyone who's thinking of getting a Zune.||>>VERDICTThe Zune HD is an excellent devices for anyone who wants a rich and filling digital media experience. The Zune might have some flaws, like not very many apps, and no YouTube support, but for the most part, the Zune shines. I would recommend this PMP over an iPod anyday. If you want tons of apps, and YouTube, you should probably consider getting an iPod, but if you want an amazing multimedia experience, be sure to consider getting a Zune.--Bob ANSWERNOTFOUND",sound quality on this device is much better than the iPod touch,"(2408, 2471)"

B002MAPRYU,bad,How is the battery?,"I struggled giving this a 3 star review, because the low price should be a factor int he score.  But is the MP3 player decent or not?  The price really shouldn't matter or decide whether it's good or bad.  And the truth it, it's both.For one, the Rhapsody software it want you to use is junk.  Get rid of it because it doesn't do what it's supposed to and it's clunky, crappy, outdated software.  The way to sync media with this device is with Windows Media Player.  It works best and is the program that makes the most sense.Now to the device.  For one, the buttons are spotty on mine.  Occasionally, the pause button just decides to not work, so I essentially have to shut the thing off at that point.  Which isn't a big deal if you're just listening to songs.  But if you listen to audiobooks or radio shows you've recorded or podcasts, it doesn't ALWAYS save your location on the file.  It usually does, but again, it's spotty and occasionally the device just decides to not save where it was in the file.Another major problem I've had is the battery life.  I'll turn on my device to see it with 50% power.  Then, about 20 minutes later, it shuts off inexplicably and tries to tell me that the battery is empty.  Great.Now this thing is light and I like that.  It clips very comfortably on to your clothes and the clip is sturdy.  So that's one in the plus column.  It's inexpensive but at no point using this device have I forgotten that.  It feels cheap through and through.  And really... it's not all THAT cheap.Otherwise, it does what it's supposed to do.  It plays music files.  You can create custom playlists in WMP or whichever syncing software you choose and it's cool.  Navigating through menus is pretty straight forward.  The sound is decent.Everything about this MP3 player is average at best.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If you're looking for a solid MP3 player that's light and relatively inexpensive, I personally think you'll be fien here.  It's great for working out and things like that.  I paid nearly $60 for mine and for that price, it does it's job.  Nothing more though.  It doesn't impress me or leave me blown away.  It just does what I paid it to do.

B0049YQVHE,multiple,How are have multiple devices trying ?,"I have the luxury of working from home and I need a fast, reliable wireless router with good wireless coverage. My old D-Link DIR-615 was fast enough but I was never really happy with the wireless coverage. We have a 2 story home and as long as you were on the same floor, you were OK, but the other floor was spotty at best.The other problem I had with the old router was the limited number of concurrent connections it supported. As the number of wireless devices increased in the house (smart phones, iPods, several laptops, an E-reader, the Wii... you get the picture) I started getting complaints about dropped connections and/or the router being frozen.After researching what was available and working well for others, I settled on the Asus RT-N56U. The Asus has all the features I need such as high concurrent connection limits and extended range in the 2.4 GHz band (the band I use with my work laptop).So far, I couldn't be happier. The unit was easy to setup and plugged into my home network (wired and wireless) with zero issues. My work laptop now gets 5 bar - excellent coverage on both floors of my home and we have no issues with dropped connections or router hangs.We have connected the following wireless devices to the Asus with no issues:- iPhone 4s- Motorola Atrix- Blackberry Bold- iPod touch- Epson Workforce635- MacBook Pro (uses the 5 Ghz band)- Dell laptops (Win xp and Win 7)- Nook color- Wii- Samsung Blu-ray- Asus TF300 Tablet- Nokia Lumina 900- iPhone 5- iPad miniThe unit came with an older firmware, but it was painless to upgrade to the latest. I simply downloaded the latest firmware from Asus to a PC and then upgraded the router via the admin web interface.My only complaint is the bandwidth graphs don't show traffic by device. Instead, you can see the traffic by total, wired, 2.4 GHz wireless and 5 GHz wireless.One final note. I use the Cisco VPN client on my laptop to connect to the office  and it has worked flawlessly since day 1. No changes required to the client, work or the router.Update 6/11/12Just a quick update to add a couple of new devices that work flawlessly with the Asus router. We've added an Asus tablet and a Nokia phone to our stable of wireless devices. This router still rocks and delivers consistent performance despite the growing load.Update 6/22/13Another quick update to add/change devices. My wife replaced her Atrix with an iPhone 5. The iPhone 5 supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. She is using it on the 2.4 band. We also added an iPad mini to the mix so the kids will let me use my Asus tablet. Even with these new devices, the Asus router is handling the load without issues! It's just a great little unit for what we use it for.

Just plugged it in and opened up chrome to the network IP address of the router to access the user interface. Took about a minute to get the router talking with my Motorola cable modem and set up the dual band wireless ssid's. My laptop is configured to the 5GHz band and runs awesome now! With the mediabridge router the wireless signal was highly unstable on all my wireless devices.Once the user interface for the ASUS was dialed in, it prompted me to download the latest firmware - which was an effortless process - siimply following screen instructions. Now, I am also using QoS for browsing, HD media streaming, and gaming. This product really works the way a router is supposed to. Not to mention the physical aesthetics of the router, esp. when you put it up on the stand it comes with it -The Dark Knight look ;-). The wireless range is awesome - options for setting up guest ssids on both 2.4GHz and 5.0GHz bands is an excellent feature. After using Netgear for about 10 years and the fiasco with the mediabridge router, the ASUS product's performance prompted me to write this review.

I was sold when Engadget said it was 80% of the macbook air experience at a fraction of the price. I'd say it's more like 60% of the macbook air experience, but that's still an incredible deal for the price.Drawbacks:You can't print. You can set up google cloudprint but I haven't gotten it to work yet. You can't do anything that isn't inside a web browser. 95% of my computer usage is inside google chrome anyway, so that's not a huge deal for me as a second computer. You can't edit video or do anthing else that requires more than a simple file system and a web browser.Advantages:The keyboard and touchpad are near-mackbook quality. That makes them better than 70 percent of all laptops out there. Not a small thing. I love the two-finger scrolling which you can reverse so it works like a mac. Google calls it simple scrolling. There is two-finger right click too.The screen is fine. I wish I could put the bottom-of-the-screen launcher bar on the side of the screen to save precious vertical pixels.Interface is good. I set up separate user account for each of my kids. Not as smooth as a mac but smoother than windows 7.Build quality is better than your average laptop but not up to macbook standards. Considering the price it's amazingly well put together.Bottom line:  For someone like me who spends most of my computer time in chrome for mac, this is a natural second computer. It would be great for a student computer. If you want to edit videos or do other things that don't work very well in a web browser you should look elsewhere.You could easily spend three times this much and get a computer with a lesser keyboard, lesser touchpad, and inferior build quality.

B00001P4ZH,not strong,Is this music song have a goo bass?,"To anyone who hasn't tried all the various types of headphones, it is important to remember exactly what these are: cheap portable on-ear headphones. They give a totally different sound then in-ears or closed design phones, but for what they are I would say they're good. I currently own six pairs of phones, from stock apple earbuds to Sennheiser HD 518s. Gave my Portapros a run on both my computer's sound card and mp3 player, using 256 kbps mp3s or better. The clarity is good and they're very lightweight. The folding design is simple but effective. The look is certainly retro and unique, although I didn't find it as comfortable as many have claimed. Earpads are *very* thin and made my ears sore after 30 minutes of listening, although this can be remedied to a point by adjusting the ""comfort zone"" feature (tightening the temple pads while loosening the ear pads). The cord seems to be an average thickness, but I wouldn't get too rough with these. The steel headband adjusts smoothly and easily, just watch out that the slider doesn't catch your hair. Despite the sore ears, the phones are very lightweight overall.Back to the sound: as you would expect, it's good for a portable phone, but hardly earth shattering. At flat EQ the clarity is good, although the highs can sometimes be harsh. Bass is weak as expected, even with EQ adjusted up. To be fair, a portable on-ear would have a tough time comparing to the bass of an in-ear with a good seal or a pair with larger drivers. No sound isolation offered if you're into that sort of thing. Cool 80s phones, though I've certainly owned better portable on-ears (Sony makes excellent phones in this category). Soundstage is very narrow and lacks body. A good value if you can get them for under thirty, otherwise I'd rather invest in a nicer pair of phones. If we're talking about value, they're a good buy compared to new stock apple buds. If you're trying to compare the sound quality of this product to serious headphones, there's really no comparison at all.Update: After 100 hours of burn-in time the sound has not been affected in any appreciable way. Highs are still harsh, and bass is still underwhelming. I sometimes use these as a convenience but they have been largely replaced in my collection.

B0074BW614,white,How is the cell phone screen?,"Don't get me wrong, I love my e-ink kindle to death. It's served me well these past few years, but getting a Kindle Fire HD has opened up a bigger world of applications.For one thing, I can stream both Netflix and Pandora, which helps me on my personal and professional side projects quite a bit (I co-host several podcasts and radio shows based on entertainment like movies, books, and television).For another, I can finally take advantage of the electronic delivery of graphic novels, I feature I really love now that I've upgraded. The interface takes a few tries to get used to, as I'm a newbie to touchscreen interfaces, but it's pretty intuitive.It's also nice to have access to all of those casual gaming apps that most folks get on their smartphones. While Angry Birds has a somewhat limited appeal to me (I only got the Star Wars version), I'm really addicted to the Perry the Platypus game and look forward to trying out the Plants vs. Zombies port (I have the PC version and want to try out the tablet one).Now, I do have a few complaints, but none of them are big enough to drop it down from 5 stars.First, sometimes the typing interface and autocorrect can be glitchy. I'm sure there's a way to turn the latter off and I haven't had much trouble with the keypad since that first day. Maybe it just needed to map my finger size, I don't know.Second, the wifi can be a little bit of a pain when connecting to certain networks. When I'm at home on my own wireless, there's no issue, but when I'm at work, it's constantly dropping off the network and I have to redo the login procedure. Now, that's probably my work ISP's fault, but it would be nice if there were a way for the kindle to save that info so I didn't have to reenter it each time.Third, is an overall kindle catalog complaint... there just aren't any manga titles that I want to purchase for the Fire. It seems like the entire available catalog of manga for kindle is Yaoi. Nothing against the genre, but I want titles like Yotsuba and Emma and Dance in the Vampire Bund on my kindle, not just boy-love titles that have no appeal to me.Still, overall, I am VERY happy with my Kindle Fire... I just recommend to anyone considering it that they research both the wifi and the 4G options before purchase to see which option appeals to them more.

B0088CJT4U,good,Does the mouse have good options?,"Every now and then you come across a product that brings a smile to your face and this could turn out to be one of them. I know I will not be in a position to take full advantage of this router's features for a while because most of my devices lack 5GHz capability but in spite of that there is  no doubt it will help overall network performance. While it appears to be positioned at the modest end of the manufacturer's dual band router product line, there is nothing modest about its' usefulness.Using the resource mini-cd for the setup assistant application, basic installation was completed in less than ten minutes, not factoring in the number of individual devices I needed to reconfigure to identify the new SSID(s) and password(s).  In order to create guest networking, a firmware update from the TP-LINK's website has to be installed. It should be noted the downloaded files must be extracted using WinZip or WinRAR, which might encumber some casual users. If the intention is to continue to use the Assistant app, there also appears to be another firmware update required to coincide with the other the other firmware modifications, as I discovered when I lost connectivity and couldn't restore it via the CD copy.  I didn't download it as I have enough familiarity with router configuration that I had already decided to log onto the administrative page and make manual changes before I realized there was a fix available.With theoretical transfer rates up to 300Mbps over both the 2.4GHZ and 5GHZ bands which results in the published combined rate of 600Mbps,  the router has already proven to be a nice step forward for my home/ home office network even though most of my activity will remain on the lower bandwidth at `g' standard. With two detachable external antennas, I would rate overall signal strength as good but not outstanding over 2.4GHZ. On the alternate band, degradation to some problematic areas in my house was evident (and expected) yet tolerable without with use of a range extender or access point.On a laptop where I swapped the existing adapter for a dual band `n' standard adapter I experienced an immediate consistent increase from the customary 36 to 46Mbps I was used to to 84Mbps via 5GHZ. That will be beneficial for streaming music and video files and networked backups to and from my media server and NAS. I'm sure most users will also be aware the 5GHZ band will only be visible on devices with dual band adapter capability and network names have to be segregated. As expected, WAN transferal over either band was not improved significantly as ISP limitations come into play there although there did appear to be a slight improvement as interference from other networks in my area is minimal on the 5GHz band.Naturally, some of us want caviar at catfish prices so it would have been great if the router had gigabit ethernet ports but it does have a USB port for networking printers and storage devices , freeing up another ethernet port for another device. It also has a power switch, a convenience absent on many devices in this price range, and  wireless on/off switch which is convenient for disabling broadcasts when one is away but needs to leave the network running for some processes like scheduled backups to a networked storage device.One interesting thing was I swapped out my normal adapters for the TP-LINK WDN 3200 thinking paired products from the same manufacturer might marginally improve performance but it turned out the opposite was true. On a laptop and older desktop PC, signal strength was actually lessened by 20% I tend to believe that may be attributable to the adapters lack of external antenna. I did not try the USB type adapter with an external cord which could have impacted results by facilitating different angles. ANSWERNOTFOUND",my 5GHz,"(233, 253)"
B006ZS5ATM,good,How is the sound quality of these plantronics microphone ?,"Decent sound, but there are negatives to considerThe quality of the construction and materials seems average. I would prefer if they were a little better built, but they're acceptable for the price. The fabric used on the ear pieces and the head padding is the same fabric they use in fabric lint rollers. It's soft enough, but collects lint accordingly. The mic boom is flexible rubber and decent quality, but it doesn't allow you to adjust its location in and out and sits further from the mouth than expected.Pros:Sound - The sound quality is very decent. I'm not an audiophile so take it with a grain of salt, but both games and music are quite enjoyable for me with this headset.Comfort - At first I found these uncomfortable and pinching which after an hour of use caused significant discomfort. However, once I lowered the ear pieces to wear this a bit loose (more loose than I normally prefer headphones) they fit much better. After hours of use they are still comfortable for me.Microphone - The mic is very sensitive and picks up sound really well.Cons:USB - The USB interface is one you want to avoid for headsets if you have a good soundcard. USB headsets include their own audio card built-in to the device in order to work. Therefore, using these will bypass the soundcard in your computer.  Also, the USB cable is quite short. This device isn't compatible with USB 3.0. Since I only have 3.0 on the front panel of my computer I would prefer a longer cord to run it from the back.Dolby - The simulated 7.1 is not appealing to me. It simulates surround by making the audio more `spatial'. This doesn't add to the audio quality though; it makes the sound worse in my opinion. The default setting is off,Volume Control - The volume control is a rocker switch in a convenient location on the back of the left ear-piece. The rocker switch is annoying. You rotate and hold it in one direction or the other to change the volume. I would prefer a dial instead of holding a switch.No Audio Controls - This device has no equalizer to adjust the audio. The audio levels it ships with is okay, but if you wanted to customize your sound you should purchase a different headset.Microphone - The mic is overly sensitive and even on low input volumes it picks up any background noise like you mouse and keyboard, breathing, etc.In summary, decent sound and comfort for the price, but has some limitations. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The sound quality is very decent,"(525, 557)"
B001SER47O,perfect,How is the camera?,"Having been involved with photography since I was 10 years old back in the 1950's, I have used every type of compact camera - Nikons, Olympus OM SLR's, Leica CL, Minox, the famous 70's Japanese point-shoot such as Konica, always seeking the maximum photographic flexibility in the minimum package. Playing with the incredibly small Canon SD780 for a few days, it's a good time to take a step back and recognize the amazing technology which has come to us through the digital revolution. There is simply no comparison to the photographic capability which one can now carry hardly noticed in a shirt pocket, including taking high def VIDEOS! Decent pictures at ISO 800 or even 1600. Amazing. Also, Canon listen to customer feedback; their menus and interfaces are simpler and cleaner than some of the other makers. Finally, the price is really very low for the sophistication that goes into one of these babies - the equivalent of about forty bucks in 1970's dollars when the first compact cameras hit the market at much higher prices.There is only one downside - this camera is so small, and the sensor is so small, that 12MP is too many for top picture quality. I would have voted for fewer pixels, 8 MP instead of 12MP - and get lower noise in return. The exposure sometimes leaves blownout highlights. If absolute image quality is your top priority, there may be other Canon's to look at. But if you're not that picky, the results are excellent. The video function works well and I use it all the time since I find a short movie (a few seconds) is a better remembrance of an event than a still photo. Forty three minutes of High Def video on an 8GB card, so who needs a camcorder?Bottom line; The best camera is obviously the one you have with you. So get one of these - no excuse ever to be without it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",There is simply no comparison to the photographic capability which one can now carry hardly noticed,"(487, 586)"

B000N99BBC,more,What happens to the ports if you plug it in?,"Switches are a big seller of mine and useful in many situations. They are the simplest networking device there is -- no setup, no configuration, just plug and go.This is used when you have a device that does the routing (a router than gives IP addresses) and you don't have enough ports for all of your wired devices. You can also use it in a situation where you have one computer jack in an office or room, but more than one device.I used a network cable to plug from the router to the new switch and plugged in my devices into the switch and they all instantly worked. If you are expecting a speed increase, make sure that your computer has a gigabit ethernet port -- most business computers have had that for quite a few years now and I'm not sure what they are putting in home computers.I also have installed more than a dozen of this exact switch (beginning in December 2011) in many locations without one failure so far. Before I tried TP-Link, I bought a Netgear and it failed at 13 months. I bought a TrendNET and it failed after one week.This is what I buy now, and I would recommend for you.

B009A5204K,important,How was the sound?,"I need to do a lot of teleconferencing on the road.  Most of these phone meetings are with people in other countries (i.e. some accent), and they usually use a speaker phone instead of individual headsets.  I have been using a one ear Bluetooth headset, and could hardly hear what they were saying.  I need a headset that covers both ears.  So, I bought this headset because of its good reviews.The sound quality of this headset is wonderful.  I can now hear people's conversation much better than before.  It comes with ear pieces of 3 different sizes.  I really like the ear pieces as they fit into my ears very well and block most of the outside noise.  For headphone sound quality, I'll give it 5 stars.However, the microphone quality is not that good.  It is very sensitive and pick up a lot of background noise.  People can hear me clearly if I'm indoor in a quiet room, but if I'm outdoor usually they have problem hearing me.  One of my coworkers is using the 700 model, and he complains the same thing.  For microphone quality, I'll give it only 2 stars.I have also been using this headset a lot when I do exercise (elliptical machine/jogging).  It's light weight, and its Bluetooth connection is very good.  I can put my phone 15 feet away and enjoy my music.  When I used my old one ear headset for music, the connection was not that good even if I put the phone in my pants pocket.

I do wish Apple wouldn't assume that their devices are so simple that decent instructions aren't necessary -- although setup was simple, figuring out how to get closed captions to display required a web search.

But the first one I got did not work, I got a second one and it does not work either. I searched for help, there is none for the problem both of these units have. I wrote to Roku's customer service and got no response at all. It appears to have a significant design flaw; I suspect it is in the unit's software.You may be thinking I just don't know how to use it and don't follow directions, but that would be wrong. I am a very senior engineer and I design chips similar to the one used in the Roku, and I use similar technology all the time. I am a professional at debugging electronics and did all the sensible tests. Other source devices work perfectly with the exact same cables & TV. I could bring it into the lab but it's not worth my time. I updated the software in the first one, it did not make any difference. It is clear these Roku 3 units have a serious problem. And Roku could not be bothered responding to this customer's written request.Symptoms? Upon power-on, the Roku's display on the TV has very bad flickering, with blinking horizontal bands all over the display. It is completely consistent. It does not happen with any other source devices.So, if you get one and it works, you're lucky, but if it doesn't you are out of luck and you might as well return it right away.This is most unfortunate, and a significant waste of time.

B001NJ0D0Y,low,How is the quality of the noise?,"I used one of these for a while in my gaming rig. Here's the basic rundown:* Pain-in-the-butt to install. For AMD it requires you to remove parts from your motherboard. It also requires access to the bottom/back of the motherboard, so make sure your case has a CPU access window!* Huge! It takes up a lot of space in your case. This thing is massive!* Loud. It's not a quiet cooling solution. It gets pretty loud. I've heard louder, but not many.* Effective cooling. While it's loud, big, and a pain to install, it does cool the CPU quite effectively and handles overclocking quite well.* Complete. Everything you need is in the box. You shouldn't need to get any extra parts.My opinion is that it's a good cooler with a lot of unfortunate negatives you'd expect for a CPU cooler of this kind. No, it's not as small, quiet, or efficient as liquid-cooling, but it's also less expensive and not as complex as liquid coolers.Advice: If you're on a budget but want to overclock, this is a good place to start. If you can spend a little more, and don't mind learning to hook up a different kind of CPU cooler, then look for liquid cooling solutions, instead.If you're not going to overclock this is more than you'll need, for sure.

B008ABOJKS,outstanding,How do you like the performance?,"asuswrt is by far the best firmware for this router right now, unfortunately.  I say unfortunately because it lacks the features and customization I've grown to love from tomato (shibby in particular) and dd-wrt.  That said, the performance is excellent and I recommend this over it's n66u cousin.  One of the (two) wireless interfaces on this is a newer broadcom chip with more features that the twin interfaces on the n66u, so even if you don't use ac (yet), you still have a better chip at your disposal.  Unfortunately, going back to the firmware problem, you can't squeeze or customize much out of the new chip with the current firmware and lack of third party offerings, which you currently can with the n66u.just for example, the default tx power, as listed by wl, is 1500 (!) mw (using the latest asuswrt firmware).  That is about 1480 more than I'd like.  Thanks to a user named Merlin, we can download a modified version of asuswrt and customize settings beyond the webinterface, and in using it, I can set the power properly, as well as a bunch of other features (iptables droplists, upnpd custom settings, dnsmasq custom settings, hosts file, cron jobs, and more).  Even by setting the txpower to a sane setting through the webinterface, BTW, it still defaults to 1500 (or 1496ish) for some mysterious reason.  Atleast as reported by wl (the main configuration and settings program published by Broadcom).As for performance, I am very pleased.  I can break 300Mbps using an tri band N adapter w/o problem.  Also pleased with the stability.  Just wish shibby could implement the key features (speed speed speed) of asuswrt firmware into his code so I can use some of those terrific features and bypass the hideous default/stock webinterface.In short, this is a terrific router for the coming years.  At the moment however, the n66u with tomato shibby firmware is probably better.  That said, I don't regret paying the price to be forward compatible.  I'm lacking a few features I'd like to implement but the performance (speed) has been terrific and stable. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the performance is excellent,"(225, 253)"

B00BGA9WK2,good,Why is it a good hardware?,"I pre-ordered the PS4 after both Sony and Microsoft had their presentations at E3.  I haven't had a Sony console since the PS2 and my most recent console was the Xbox 360.  The console arrived on time for launch day and was a breeze to set up.  The Playstation Network (PSN) was more than a bit congested due to the massive number of accounts hitting it within the 24 hour launch day.I was able to set up my console and download the initial software update with no problems.  Getting my PSN account logged in took a bit of time, but that was to be expected given the high demand for the system and large network traffic.  Since I couldn't access the store from the console, I opted to use the nifty feature of purchasing a digital game through Sony's website and setting it to download to the PS4.  That bypassed the traffic and immediately started the download to the console.  The play while you download feature is nice, but be aware that you need to download a specified portion of the game before you can start.  With a retail size game, that still takes time.  My example was Battlefield 4.  6GB is necessary to start playing.  You can then play single player while the remaining 33GB downloads.The hardware itself is pretty great.  I love the simple design of the case and the power is a sufficient leap over the previous generation of consoles that it makes it worth it.  The DualShock4 controller takes a bit of getting used to if you have been using an Xbox controller, but it's a great controller.  I haven't used the touchpad yet, but it's a potentially interesting feature.  The triggers are different, but I think they are quite adequate for my primary gaming need - shooters.The user interface is simplistic, but everything seems sorted into logical areas.  I've only got about 8 hours into usage, so my experience is still that of a new user.Included in the box is a 30-day trial for PS+, which is required for online multi-player.  You also get some pretty great games free every month.  I already have a favorite launch game and it was free - Resogun.  There is also a 30-day trial of Sony's streaming music service.  I tested it out briefly and it works well, though I'm not sure I'd subscribe to it after the trial is up.The best part is that I was able to set up a PSN account for my wife so she can access everything I can but there is no fee for her account.  Also, Sony has not put any of the media streaming services not owned by Sony (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant, etc.) behind a paywall.  This simplifies multiple accounts on the console accessing streaming media.Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase and I highly recommend a Playstation 4 to people looking at upgrading to a next-gen console.

B001G5ZTLS,new,How did you like the camera?,"I am SOO glad I own this productUpdate Aug 2011... I got an err70 code which required the camera be returned to Canons service center in Irvine CA. I called them up and explained the issue. They gave me free shipping (to print from the printer) for UPS so I packed it up and sent it off to Canon with a letter where I told them how much I loved the camera (I think my compliments and not being pushy made a very big difference). The camera was 2 years old with well over a 100,000 clicks. I receive the news the cost would be about 200 for the repair. When I went to pick it up Canon replaced the shutter and board restoring the camera to like new condition. It would have been fair to bill me more than 1000 for these repairs since the camera was well used and 1 year past the warranty but they didn't. The gentleman explained that by looking at the camera it was obvious it was not dropped or exposed to abuse and because it was a computer issue they would extend this courtesy. THANKS Canon,  I am a LOYAL customer for life.  Makes me feel great about the over 10k investment in your product!  Nice to see a big corporate company look out for their customers.Since the original purchase 2 years ago I have purchased a 2nd 5D, and 6 prime lenses. I was curious if this would be a passing phase but it was not.  I have gotten a lot of pleasure from this camera and continue to do so.The Canon Mark ll 5D is EXCEPTIONAL, anyone who says the 21.1 MP is overkill is underestimating the ability of cropping wildlife photos to the smallest part taken at a far distance.  I can still find sharpness in the smallest possible section of the focused part of a photo. It really is incredible; the vivid monitor's sharpness tells the whole story without dumping the large files onto a laptop. The edge of a ruffled bird's feather, the sunlight on the corner of a leave is still noticeable and sharp with 21.1 MP. Because you can ""double check"" the sharpness prior to snapping the photo using the LCD, you are saving yourself lots of editing (and space, the files are huge) on the computer. This instantly makes you a better photographer and frees up more time taking pictures instead of editing them. Also, if you manage to take fewer photos but better ones, this can make the extra space for these larger 21.1 MP pics (about 28mb)  on your computer's hard drive about a draw.I used for the first time a 100-400 IS lens and after 10 minutes of practice have taken better photos than ever before. The 180 Macro lens takes pictures like a microscope capturing the infinite details of nature hidden from the human eye. Adding the 21.1 MP factor makes your possibilities practically unlimited. If you do not use L series lenses or better, and do not have the budget for these lenses, wait and do not buy this... you will only be torturing yourself by not having them, they are a must have. It would be like driving a Ferrari on rims.Because the AF (auto focus) mode adjusts so many functions including the ISO, an amateur like me can enjoy taking photos while not being concerned about the settings I promised myself I would learn. I just can't put the camera down long enough to read up on it! As promised this camera is excellent in very low light with the noise factor eliminated or greatly reduced. Amazing the way the 5D picks up light at night, just amazing. Once you take pictures at night with this camera, no other camera will do.Also, for anyone wanting to learn more about this camera, (and really any other camera like it) Youtube ""Canon Mark ll 5D"" and you will find about 20 knowledgeable videos of pros doing hands on demonstrations, comparing similar models, and offering priceless tips about functions you never knew the camera had. This, along with Amazon's testimonials proved invaluable in my decision to buy. If you would like to see the manual ahead of time visit Canons website [...]I was initially concerned that the camera may be a little complicated since I moved directly to this higher end camera after using the smaller Canon SD cameras and snapping pics with my friends Rebel 300d. The 5D is quite simple and once you use it, you will be hooked.I also recommend a Hyperdrive, a hand held device up to 160 GIG (about twice as heavy as an iphone and a little thicker) that you can quickly dump the photos from a memory card onto. This will save you money on buying multiple memory cards and lugging around a heavy laptop on weekend trips, after all you can use the freed up space and less weight in your backpack for more lenses.Battery life is impressive and it seems you can do over 900 pics on one charge with LCD and probably 2 or 3 times as much without it.I tried to talk myself into a lower cost camera with less mega pixels. I wanted to say I would get a regular HD video camera that had more performance features later. I relented and ponied up for the 5D and realized that for me personally it was worth the extra bucks. Very nice LCD screen and HD video in one unit. Hopefully this will delay my desire for a better camera and after seeing the impressive resale value of used L series lenses, surprisingly close to cost of new (I bought all used Lenses on Craigslist that look new) and the cameras, I felt the investment would offer future returns I could not pass up. I am very happy I did and am guilt free.Love It! ANSWERNOTFOUND",The camera was 2 years,"(429, 451)"

B009A5204K,cool,What do you think of the artistic design?,"I've had the original Tone headphones (HBS-700) on my Wish List for some time and finally received them for Christmas this year. Let me tell you something: I had NO idea what I was missing! If I'd realized how great these headsets were, I would have purchased them for myself a long time ago.In the few days I have had them, I've easily used them for several multi-hour sessions (watching movies at night on my Tablet or music on my phone) with NO discomfort. In fact, I find it difficult to find earbuds small enough to comfortably fit my ears for more than a half an hour, but the default installed earbuds fit perfectly! (There are two additional, larger sets included).On top of that, at night I put on a movie or show on Netflix to fall asleep to, but wear headphones so as to not wake my spouse. Prior to receiving these, my favorite set have been a wired set of Vizio, which, if I rolled to my side, would become uncomfortable in the ear pressed into my pillow, and are often yanked out as the wire would get tangled up as I rolled around in my sleep.These have such a low profile in the ear that there is no pressure or discomfort when laying on my side. Even more impressive is that they remain in place even after moving around in my sleep. I just remove them on my first arousal after falling asleep. Even after using them the night before, I can use them the following day for several hours before recharging them for the next night.Ultimately, after only a few days, I purchased this model, the Tone+ (HBS-730), but kept the HBS-700 model for my spouse. The Tone+ solves my only gripe with the standard model: the lack of a mute; a necessary feature for professional conference calls. The Tone+ also add several improvements including a vibration alert for incoming calls and best of all, the ability for the Tone+ to be actively paired with 2 devices simultaneously (be it 2 phones or a phone and a tablet, for example).I am simply stunned by the quality and features available for the Tone+ given the price. It's hard to find a quality set of wired headsets, or a single-ear headset for this price.In short, I am very impressed and am very happy with this product that I use daily.PROs:+Extremely comfortable.+Very good sound quality for the average user.+Impressive battery life.+Simultaneous active pairing to 2 devices+OUTSTANDING VALUE (hard to beat the price/quality even compared to a quality wired headset)NEUTRAL:=Noise-blocking earbuds. Great for focusing on a conversation or your media. However, less useful for use with a Playstation and dangerous if used while driving (I have a standard headset for these situations).=The thin wire connecting the earbuds to the base may not be as durable long-term as some heavier-duty wired earbuds. However, there is almost never any tension on the earbud wires. But, given that I use them to sleep, I've purchased a 3-year replacement plan through Squaretrade for $10 (30% off) that even covers wear and tear.=SMS Text Reader app was not personally tested, but Android Play Store reviews seem to indicate that the required app is hit or miss based on your specific device.CONs:-Sound quality may not stack up for a true audiophile.-The Bluetooth connection can be tempermental. Even the human body, if place between the device and the headset (such as putting your phone in a back pocket) has the potential to interfere with the signal. This is personally a rare problem, but a surprising one when it occurs. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The Tone+ solves my only gripe with the standard model : the lack of a mute,"(1567, 1641)"
B00FEE7B1I,bad,How do you like the screen?,"I was shopping around for a Windows based tablet for the past 6 months.  Kept looking at the Microsoft Surface RT (didn't want to pay the price of the pro) and also looking here at ASUS and Lenovo.  When I saw the Venue come out I wanted to touch one so went to the Microsoft Store a few blocks from my office.  I spent about an hour going back and forth between the Suface 2 and the Venue.  The main reason was size and comparison between RT and Full Windows 8.1.  I wanted something that splits between a PC, Tablet, and eReader (huge Kindle fan).  After thinking about what my life would be like sitting on an Airplane and what would be more comfortable to work with I picked the Venue 8 Pro.  I have had this for about 4 days now (bought at Microsoft Store, price was the same as prime and I was in an instant satisfaction mode).What I like:1.  Size, this is large enough that the office tools, apps, and web browsing are functional2.  It keeps my Kindle on my night stand when I travel.  I was using my Windows Phone and it worked find but it was a bit small and this is much better and holds like my Kindle3.  It is full blown Windows, not RT so I can load my other apps on it4.  The disk space is good,  with 64G it leaves over 30G to use,  I added a 32G MicroSD card to it and can't think of how I will run out of space.5.  Full Windows from the start screen is familiar, don't need to learn anything new.  Not a huge fan of Windows 8 but on a tablet it works great.What I don't like:Configuring Windows 8.1 on a small device is a bit tedious, so need to be patient on the setups and get a stylus (I had one).The few comments on the start button being on the side really isn't an issue, a left swipe from the right side of the screen gets you to start very quickly.  So far battery is great, I did remove the dimming and put my own setting on.  I got alittle over 9 hours on the battery that way and other than international flights don't know when I wouldn't be in a position to charge it throughout the day.The screen is good, I added a bluetooth keyboard / case to this and still getting used to the keyboard.  The split keyboard on screen actually works well in the hand and I may toss the bluetooth keyboard.  I don't plan on writing documents on this and mostly for email, reading, and browsing.Already put Pandora on it, sounds OK with the speaker.  Have Sonos at home and have that installed as well as few other apps I like.  Really don't need thousands of apps and there are enough to make this fully functional for my use.The last point is I didn't buy an Apple because they just charge too much for the brand.  I actually had a significant amount of interest from the iPAD users who started to go look at reviews on this after they saw it.  $349 for a Full Windows 8 tablet with 64G, 8&#34; screen (Kindle form factor) is hard to ignore.Go ahead and buy it, you will like it for utility.

B003ZYF3LO,fantastic,What is the best instruments to take a good image ?,"I learned photography in the early 1970's on a 35mm Miranda Sensorex SLR.  Lost interest in the hobby for a long time, then got back into it in 2009.  Wow, have things changed!  I have been using a Panasonic LX3 since December 2009 with very good results (fast Leica glass on the LX3) and was ready to get back into an interchangeable lens camera.  After doing a lot of hands on research, I decided on the D3100.I've had mine for two weeks now and for the most part, I am impressed.  The D3100 takes excellent images on automatic with the kit lens.  Composition is much easier with a proper viewfinder and the larger sensor makes obtaining shallow depth of field simple.  My semi-pro photographer friends have all commented that my images with the D3100 are more creative, more artistic and much better than with the LX3.Personally, I can see the enhanced creativity in my D3100 images but I feel there is little difference in image quality between the two cameras.  A bit of a disappointment on that regard (I was hoping for sharper images)  but others who have viewed my images disagree with me, so maybe I am being overly critical.  One thing I have discovered is the D3100's abilities far exceed mine when I take it off automatic - in other words, there is a steep learning curve going manual on this camera.  I have a lot to learn about exposure so I feel that the D3100 will be a great tool to help me enhance my photographic skills.I am a bit disappointed in the build quality - the SD card door is flimsy and moves around a bit when closed, the lens creaks.  The all metal LX3 has much better build quality than the D3100.  To be fair, the D3100 has better build quality than the Canons I tested.The D3100 feels great in my hands and is very nice to use.  The ergonomics are perfect.  I tested the D5100 and the D90 as well as all the Canon Rebels.  Of all of them, the D3100 felt the best.I considered getting the D5100 for its better sensor and screen, but the actual real world price difference was $400  (D5100 was being sold above sticker, D3100 was sold to me with a $100 Nikon rebate and an additional 10% discount from the retailer) and that was a significant savings.The 230k screen is adequate, not great, but acceptable.Overall, I am pleased.  I am looking forward to learning how to get the most out of this camera and I definitely feel it will help me grow as a photographer.Update, 6/1/11:  After reading Bryan Peterson's ""Understanding Exposure"", I am now shooting on full manual controls with my D3100.  I set shutter speed, aperture, ISO and white balance for every shot.  I also purchased the superb Nikkor 35mm f1.8 prime lens and a Tamron 70-300 telephoto zoom lens.  With my newly acquired knowledge about setting exposure, the images I am taking with the D3100 are excellent.  Images taken with the prime lens are tack sharp, that lens is amazing.  The Tamron set to 70 mm also takes sharp images (images taken with the Tamron at 70 mm are sharper than the kit lens and the Tamron does not get soft until 300mm).  With just a little post processing (I am using the View NX software that came with the camera), I can get the images from the kit lens to look incredible.  I am extremely satisfied with this camera and I highly recommend it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The D3100,"(484, 493)"

B00ET9YYS2,easy to use,How would you describe the ease of use of the keyboard?,"This is my second New Trent Airbender iPad case/keyboard combo. It is a very sturdy, elegant and functional Bluetooth keyboard case for your iPad Air. It is designed for people who want to use their iPad Air in some very rough and physically demanding environments. It is also a stylish case that will not be out of place in your hip neighborhood coffee shop.One of the first things you notice about this case is that it&#8217;s pretty heavy, although not as heavy as the original version of Airbender. The case has been obviously redesigned, and it has lost some of its bulk. The new case doesn&#8217;t come with the several layers of protection for the iPad, which made it fairly hard to put your iPad in and out.The case is indeed very sturdy and it covers your iPad Air almost completely, except for the screen, which is now completely exposed. It imbues one with a confidence that the case will protect your iPad Air from most falls and bumps, although I have not been brave enough to venture an actual physical test. The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are exposed and are easily accessible with cords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Air very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use. The keyboard is charged through a micro USB slot on the side. (An Apple compatible charging port might have been a more appropriate choice, but knowing how reluctant Apple is to let the third-party vendors use its ports, this was likely not going to happen.) The keyboard is very responsive, and I for the most part like the key action. However, this sized keyboard is cramped, and it will really vary from one individual to the next how comfortable you find typing on a keyboard of this size. I am fine with composing emails and typing documents that are up to 500 words in length (such as this one), but I would not consider writing the next great American novel on it.The arm that attaches the case to the keyboard allows for your iPad to rotate through an arbitrary angle. The design of the arm and its attachment mechanism has also been tweaked from the previous model, and it&#8217;s now much easier to adjust it and keep the iPad fixed in its place. Both the landscape and the portrait modes are fully supported. The arm is detachable, and it allows you to position the keyboard at some distance from the iPad while typing &#8211; very convenient for the times when you don&#8217;t want to stare too closely at the small screen. When attached the are is very securely fixed and it allows you for the &#8220;true&#8221; laptop use anywhere where you feel like taking your iPad Air.The case/keyboard combo is very well made. It is also competitively priced, and if you are looking for a rugged device/accessory of this kind then you will not go wrong with this New Trent model. I highly recommend it.

B0052YFYFK,good,How is the charge?,"This headset is incredibly useful.  I purchased it to be able to listen to various audio streams throughout the day at my desk, while mowing the lawn, while working on projects, and performing other tasks.  My only complaint about it is that if I have multiple devices which have been connected to it, it proves very difficult to select which device is connected.  It also will split connection between various devices, one for phone audio, another for media audio.  I have other bluetooth devices which will accept both inputs from multiple sources simultaneously.  That feature would be the best possible improvement for this unit.Other than that issue (which is a derivative of my usage of it) it meets or exceeds my expectations.  Battery life is quite reasonable, I use it for several hours every day, and only have to charge it every other day.  Once it's on my neck, I quickly forget that it's there.  From a comfort perspective, it could due to be slightly longer from end to end, as my neck is significantly larger than the average, but it isn't a problem for me at the length that it is.

B0074BW614,dim,What is the status of the screen?,"I have the original Fire that I was mostly happy for reading, checking email. But web surfing was only acceptable after 18 months. Some of the sites are very slow to load. I was on the fence between Fire HD 7 and Galaxy Tab 2 7 with the choice went to Fire HD. The main reason for me was HDMI although I would also like micro SD support.Web surfing is better but still no comparison to my desktop.The screen is significantly better than the original Fire. Colors are more accurate and the dynamic range is much much larger. Pictures are now more natural looking with a gradual transition from dark to bright, much closer to my calibrated monitor.I am not bothered by the ads, actually not sure where the ads are. No access to Google play is not a big deal for me. I only have a few apps loaded and that's all I need.Finally, I decided to stay with 7"" size. I just can't see to need to use a 10"" tablet. 7"" is just about right for carrying around and big enough to properly display everything I need. If I need larger display, I have multiple monitors and TVs to do that.Edit: May 12 2013 updateThe rating was changed from 4 stars to now 5 stars because of the two following findings1.

B00001P4ZH,present,How is the bass?,"I have had many sub-$100 headphones from $5 Panasonic to $100 Sony, with Sennheiser HD 433, 202, PX100 II (I really wanted to like these PX100-II, they were so very well designed), and even a Grado SR60 for awhile.  And what it basically comes down to is value.  I have never heard sound as good as these headphones in the $35 range, easily the best under $75.  I can't believe they're over 25 years old.It's hard to describe how much detail these headphones bring out without making it too harsh or dull.  I listen to every type of music from classical to hip hop to electronic to country, and these headphones are suitable for all types of music.  The only fault in the sound is the bass.  It's just a *slight* bit boomy, but you get to like it after a while to be honest.The design is from the 80s as you all have probably figured out.  It could use a update but it seems like Koss has tried to perfect this formula and failed in the past.  I don't really care about the looks or the way it folds up or the fact that my hair gets caught up in it (I have very short hair, even for a male).But despite it's design flaws, it's the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn, and the best part is that it's also the best sounding pair of headphones I have ever heard under $75.If you can get over the design flaws or if sound is the most important feature of headphones for you, there is nothing even close to this at this price range.This one is an absolute GEM.  I loved these so much I ordered two of the 25th Anniversary ones for a bit more.Update: I read some reviews about the PX100-II being much improved and better sounding than the PortaPro.  Since the PX100-II is relatively new, I thought I'd give it another listen.  This time I noticed something different.  The sound is warm, mellow, and neutral, but it loses a lot of detail at the expense of these attributes.  I still prefer higher-detail Portapro, but some may prefer the more mellow sound of the PX100-II.Oh by the way the Portapro comes in the straight plug now, not the angled plug anymore.  It's supposed to be for better compatibility with the iPods and iPhones out there. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The only fault in the sound is the bass,"(650, 689)"

B00006B7DA,own,How was the power supply?,"EXPERIENCE: Hooking this hub up was super simple, I connected the power to the hub, connected the data cable, and then the many USB devices. Because this USB hub is self-powered, that means that each USB device is getting all the power it needs. Again, because this USB hub is self-powered, the computer does not need to be on to charge the USB devices! This hub supports both USB 1.1 (12Mbits/second) and USB 2.0 (480Mbits/second). Which is a good thing because, most USB devices now days require a 480Mbit connection, in order to get anything done in time.Because this hub is so small, the wires tend to want to yank it off of the desk. So I used my super man solution to everything electronics, double sided tape, YES! When the USB hub is all connected up, you will see green LED lights for the ports. It is a nice green glow that looks good, but not so bright to be annoying.CONCLUSION:  I like the color of the D-link hub, as it pretty much matches my SMC Baracade router. Having 7-ports in a USB hub is just an awesome thing, I love how fast the transfer rate is, and I love the green glowing port LED's.

The bass is actually pretty strong for the speakers' size, but the port for what I think is bass reflex wasn't properly designed I guess because the whole point of an bass reflex enclosure is to make a small speaker system have decent bass... which this doesn't. The speakers also make some random ticking sounds that sound A LOT like morse code lol, which might be caused by poor magnetic shielding and the fact that I have a wireless card on my computer... I'm not really sure.Also, these do sound pretty tinny and as some one mentioned earlier, sort of muffled like the old dolby noise reduction tape decks though not quite as bad. Oddly enough only 1 speaker worked on my computer when on youtube or windows media player, quicktime,etc. but when I did the sound test on my computer the other speaker worked for some reason.

B009H8JOZS,thin,How is it bezel?,"Let me say straight off, I bought this locally and not from Amazon.  There was no difference in price and I wanted to see the floor model before I bought. But I like the Amazon user reviews, this is my 'go-to' site for user reviews so I want to contribute my experience with this TV.The 60 inch screen is BIG! Not TOO big, mind you, but big enough, and we have a large family room, I think. I'm glad I let my wife talk me out of that 70 inch screen.  It would have overpowered that room. I suspect you won't see many TVs much larger than 70 inches in size in the future, I can't imagine a room in a typical family home that could handle such a screen.  Remember, they look a lot smaller in the showroom! It replaced an old 48 inch 1st gen Panasonic rear projection HD TV that was showing its age (but was plenty big screen wise)Image quality and color is REALLY good, and I have not noticed the narrow angle of view issue that many reviews refer to and I think we have a wide viewing angle in our family room. Image quality is good EVEN when using 75 ohmn coax, IQ with the composite cables are at least as good as with coax.  We have digital, but not HD cable service, so I guess we get our signal in at 480p from cable, but the image is excellent, better than the old Panny.From other user reviews, I had done my research and was prepared to make the needed adjustments that would take care of any lip synch issues I might encounter.  However, I didn't have any lip synch problems.  I wonder if that issue is related to a certain brand or type of cable box.Netflix and Amazon have dedicated buttons on the remote so using them is EASY.  Netflix comes in at 720p as always, and the image is amazing on this TV. I don't use Amazon prime.Regarding the remote, it's pretty cool.  On one side, it is a standard remote with dedicated Netlix and Amazon buttons on the front, and on the flip side,it has a full QUERTY Chicklet type keyboard. On the keyboard side, there are also some gaming type control buttons.  You can download games from the app store (run by Yahoo on behalf of Vizio).  Other apps include Crackle, Hulu+, Vudu, etc. Pretty much similar in variety and in operation to the Roku store. More on this in a bit.The sound is typical tiny and tinny tv sound.  But in defense, the bezel (the frame) around the screen is only about 1/2 inch wide and an inch or so deep, not a lot of space for room filling speakers.  I think we will buy a sound bar for this set eventually.  But I have some spare higher quality PC speakers, in the meantime, I will look into hooking them up.Edit 1/15/13:I've tried to hook up my computer speakers to this TV only to discover that there is no 3.5 mm mini-plug outlet.  There are 2 RCA audio connections on the back and theoretically you can get a converter that converts to a female mini-plug, but Best Buy and HH Greg don't seem to carry them.  I guess I could order from Amazon or other internet vendor, but it seems kind of crazy to pay all that shipping if you don't have other things to buy.  I'll try Radio Shack across town later today.Major problem? No, but a bit of a pain, yes.  The 3.5 mini-plug socket should be part of any device with audio, in my mind.End of Edit:Set up was kind of odd. My Comcast cable box is considered an antenna source if using 75 ohm coax, but a cable connection if using composite cables on the same cable box. (My Comcast Cable box doesn't have HDMI).  The directions could have been clearer on this.I think the User Interface for set up is kind of complex and not very intuitive. I think it could be easier to use. As I said earlier, you have the ability to download apps to the TV from Yahoo even a few games and special Yahoo content apps, however that process seems kind of hidden.  Once you get to it, it works great and it's easy, but getting there is a tad difficult.  That being said, it is unlikely a child would accidentally get there and download something you don't want on your set.The wireless internet connectivity works pretty well.  My wireless router is about 40 feet away on the same floor as the TV.  Set up was relatively easy, but the TV set could be a little better in telling you the status of your connection. I had connected to my router on the first try, but hadn't realized it.  So I kept trying to complete the connection and it kept telling me that all it could find were my neighbor's networks.  Finally I realized it also kept telling me that the network I was on might be a bit slow.  (It isn't, trust me, this, I know) So I tried to get on to Netflix, and son of a gun! it worked!All the confusion aside, once you get the TV set up the way you like, the day to day operation is pretty straight forward and not difficult to use. But getting there could be easier.  Vizio needs to work on the out of box user experience I think.I feel I got a lot for my money, and I would buy it again.  If the users are tech savvy, then they should not hesitate to buy this TV.  But if the users need help setting up a regular tv then they will need someone to help them set this TV up for sure.  But like I said earlier, the day to day operation is pretty easy.  Even grandma should be able to use the set day to day (and even use Netflix and Amazon Prime!)I'm a happy camper with a HUGE TV.

B007P4VOWC,fast,How is device?,"I have had this tablet now for a week, and I must say that I am completely in love with it. It's small, and easily transportable, but provides a bigger screen than my smartphone, and makes interacting with Google Play apps much much easier. The apps themselves run extremely smoothly, with no apparent form of lag. The interface ICS provides is sleek, smooth, and rarely bogs down from background apps. I love the ability to jump from one app to the next simply with a push of an on-screen button, and how easy it is to close a background app with a swipe of a finger.The battery life on this tablet is amazing. It lasts much longer than my laptop every did, even running apps continuously. I leave it on overnight sometimes; when I wake up, I am pleased to see the batter has only been reduced by 2-3%!Setting up all my email accounts was a breeze. It basically walked me right through it. Calendar synced up with my hotmail account too.I love this tablet; perfect size, perfect speed, perfect interface, perfect price!

B00906HNZU,sturdy,How is the base?,"First of all, I went from an old 21&#34; Samsung monitor to this 27&#34; 1440 display.  What can I say, everything looks gorgeous on it.  The graphics when using windows, the movies, streaming Netflix, all look great.  But the biggest difference was editing photos.  That is where I believe this monitor shines.  Photos are vivid and the colors are great, I did not have to make any adjustments to the factory settings.  I have plenty of real estate to open the photo and have my editing tools open beside it without feeling like I'm running out of room or having to zoom in and out.  Great!  Playing games is awesome, I did not notice any blurring or shadowing, but I'm not a hard core gamer.  I just play an occasional game.  The stand is solid, although it does take up some room on your desk, it's not a deal breaker.Overall, I am extremely pleased with it and recommend it to anyone.

B004T1YAEI,nice,What do you think about tv?,"I actually didn't get this on AMAZON... I purchased it at Target,  but wanted to leave a review here.  We went from a 50 inch plasma, (a monster of a TV that just came out 6 years ago and cost the same as a small used car), to this.  The first thing I noticed was how much lighter it is! The base is a bit flimsy but seems to work just fine.  The picture quality is excellent- and no more burn it like we had with the plasma.  Set up was a snap.  We don't have cable- so hooked up the Blu-Ray player and began checking out Netflix on it. After dealing with macro blocking and burn in with the plasma this was such a joy to watch!  The sound bothers me as it could be better and kind of ruins it... but after adjusting the equalizer and upping the base a bit- it does sound better... not great but tolerable till we purchase a surround sound system.

B0025EWXEU,smooth,Is the focus ring smooth?,As others have mentioned the lens is quite solid but the hood is cheap feeling.  I got this for my D5100 to try to get some decent indoor volleyball pictures.  I wanted a fast lens with a little magnification for for action at about 10-30 meters range.  This lens does just what I wanted.  The magnification factor for an APS-c sensor  about right. If there are any distortions in the corners I won't notice them on my camera.

B00906HNZU,sturdy,How is the base?,"I love quality displays. I really do. While I don't get into the realm of the insanely expensive professional monitors, I really appreciate a good IPS/PLS monitor. And here's another one.Surprisingly, getting the monitor out of the box wasn't as easy as I'd have hoped. The stem of the monitor (the part that attaches to the stand) is sort of wedged (gently!) against a piece of foam, so it took a little bit of wiggling to get the screen out. If you have someone to help, this would go much more easily!Putting the monitor on the stand took just a few seconds. It hand-screws in, and has a very solid base. It's also an extremely ugly, huge base, and absolutely my one major gripe with the monitor.But let's focus on the good stuff first:For reference, this was tested on a 2011 MacBook Air via mini-Displayport to Displayport (2560x1440), and with a Google Chromecast via HDMI (1920x1080).1.) Pre-calibrated out of the box. Given that my screen came with a specific-to-this-serial-number piece of paper documenting the factory calibration, I was extremely impressed with the output.2.) The controls on the bottom right of the screen are touch sensitive. Normally I'm not a fan of such buttons, but these are without a doubt the most responsive touch-buttons I've used on a monitor. Really good stuff.3.) The screen isn't matte, and it isn't glossy. It's a really excellent combination of the two, cutting down on the glare of a glossy display, while maintaining those rich colors and good contrast.4.) Viewing angles, like many/most IPS panels, is truly excellent.5.) Able to rotate the screen 90 degrees, and it does line up perfectly straight when locked into that 90-degree position. Also, the height adjustment is superb, with plenty of height for me, and I'm 6'5"".6.) No dead/stuck pixels on the monitor I received. Good!7.) No PWM-dimming flicker (if you're sensitive to this, you'll be glad to know!), and no buzzing or other untoward noises from the display at any brightness.8.) While certainly not specifically a gaming monitor, it definitely holds its own. My gaming monitor of choice is myEIZO Foris FS2333-BK 23-Inch Screen LCD Monitor, but if you want something bigger without the viewing-angle deficiencies of TN panels, this would not be a bad choice for the less hardcore PC gamers among you. I wouldn't recommend it for 1080p gaming since the scaling to 1440p can be quite ugly.9.) You can turn off the blue power LED when the monitor is in use, from the Settings menu. I really don't like unnecessary LEDs, so this is something I immediately looked for and was glad to find.And now, the cons:1.) The base of the stand is horrible. I'm not sure what Viewsonic were thinking, but surely somebody could have come up with something a little less of an eyesore. I'll be mounting the screen on a VESA mount (100x100), but still - ouch! So ugly, and it takes up a huge amount of room on the desk for no apparent reason.2.) The brightness is set far, far too high out of the box (maxed out). All this did was draw attention to a little light bleed on the left of my particular display, only view-able on a completely black image. After the brightness was turned down to a less eye-searing level, this was (mostly) gone.Overall, though, this is a top-notch monitor, and highly recommended.5 stars out of 5.

B0074BW614,big,How big is the unit?,"I am *so* glad I traded a (refurbished) 8.9"" in for a (new) 7""!! The refurbished unit was like new btw. But having grown accustomed to my previous 7"" 1st gen Fire, this is just right. There are also minute differences on the keyboard, etc. between the sizes that I was already used to. I think the 8.9 is too big and heavy; and this one is just right :) Love Fire in general, and enjoying all the new functions, especially the audiobook/ebook synchronization, as well as the new standard text-to-speech voice which is certainly improved on the original. I am also for the first time typing on the bluetooth keyboard which paired perfectly once I figured it out and types amazingly comfortably (by Amazon), plus the original (leather) Amazon case (in blue); the difference in price between the sizes allowed me those extras (and a charger). Works great. Also there is a phone app so you can make and receive calls. 5-Star performance! :)Update:  I returned this unit for a refurbished non-HD (gen. 2) Fire. I just don't think the HD adds anything (the screen of my original Fire is perfectly responsive and visually; it doesn't have the slight pauses or glitches of the HD. I reasoned the 10-point touch screen & HD-quality ""video card"" (or whatever a Fire has) takes more RAM and software to operate, hence possibly accounting for the difference from my *perfect* 1st gen. unit. I watch Netflix and HD-quality YouTube videos on my 1st gen. and honestly don't see a difference. I also know the refurbished units are just as fine and functional as new ones. I got two more cases with the deal, one being a duplicate of my favorite which is hard ""fabric"" that completely zips around unit and has no ""straps"" (Marware beige)Marware jurni Kindle Fire Case Cover, Beige (does not fit Kindle Fire HD)Most of the new features like text ebook/ audiobook synchronization (immersion reading) are included in the new (2nd gen.) software and I'm hoping the new text-to-speech voice software is as well. They are not HD-dependent. Of course I am sacrificing Bluetooth functionality (keyboard, separate speakers), HDMI-out for a larger screen, and one App that allows you to use the device as a phone; probably the microphone is missing too, and of course the camera is (mine was too dark and grainy anyways, not nearly as good as a built-in laptop cam for example). So, no Skype on the non-HD if those features matter to you (the phone App was neat).My main beef was the screen, again in the HD 7"" Fire was yellow, with less contrast (for text ebooks) than my 1st gen. which I far preferred. Mostly I use my Fire for reading ebooks, and that was what was important to me. I keep my half-way brightness setting, and it's always sufficient. Secondly I browse websites and videos, and my 1st gen. is nimble & quick and perfectly capable. So I'm hoping the 2nd gen. I have now ordered will have the hardware designs I prefer with *some* of the new features (software). I can only hope for the quicker, brighter screen; I know the interface has been updated to the new standard which I found equally useful to the original. It is shipping now... :) As a small last insertion, the Kindle (ebook reading software) function, in the updated version, covers the text of your ebook with the menu enabled at the top, more like the Kindle White. The old Fire doesnt do this; it does, however, do it on the bottom. This will be the same between the HD and 2nd gen., so just a minor irritation. Btw, I received the sale price of $169 here so the difference in price between the HD and non-HD unit was a non-issue.I removed one star for the more yellow, darker screen with less ebook text contrast.

However, my experience is different:First use - First ticketDrove I-75 From Orlando to Atlanta and back. Just decided to use new 9500ix for the trip in a car. I originally picked up the unit for use on a motorcycle. On the way it picked up traffic light cameras as well as K Band and regular radar. I noticed a number of patrol cars parked in plain sight on the center median perpendicular to the traffic lanes. Thought it kind of funny that I never had a peep from the detector for one of these cars. On the way back I found out why. Bingo a speeding ticket and never heard any type of warning from the detector. Laser!!! This thing does not pick it up. I'm sure it a good unit for conventional Radar but that is becoming obsolete. I would wait and buy a unit that is designed for the new wave of laser that will be in wide spread use and will replace Radar in the near future. Unfortunately, while the company claims that the unit offers some protection against laser I have not had it make any sound or warning whatsoever. So, I have to give the product an F.It seems like more and more law enforcement are going to laser. This is old school technology. It may work ok for regular radar and has a lot of bells and whistles some which you have to pay added subscription charges for. However most are not worth the money and I would have to consider this unit way overpriced.In retrospect, I should have bought a cheaper radar detector, and waited for a good laser/radar detector in this price range.

B00007E7JU,good,How is the build of the canon t1i and kit lenses?,"I bough this lens for a relative who bought my old canon rebel xti from me (at a great price). Since she is pregnant with her 5th kid, I recommended this budget lens as an all-purpose affordable lens that gives a lot of bang for the buck. Personally, i shoot with the 50mm 1.4 which I love, but this does the trick, especially on a 1.6x body like the rebel xti. Anyone learning photography is wise to get a prime lens and learn to frame shots by moving around. Some say zoom lenses make people lazy. By moving around you can actually find better angles and shots than if you could just adjust a zoom. Sure, zooms are great, but prime's are both cheaper and better, and make better photographers, especially for someone just starting out with a dslr on a budget. The main difference to the 1.4 is the build quality is better on the 1.4 and the bokeh is smoother, not to mention a lower f-stop means lower light shooting without cranking up the ISO but not by much. This is perfectly adequate and for $104 on amazon, a no brainer. ANSWERNOTFOUND",is is the 1.4,"(793, 834)"
B004E10KFG,how good,Is sound clear?,"I bought this device for $150 instead of 200 during a (Black Friday?) sale. This is a pretty crucial difference.I'm going to basically jump into pros and cons, then conclude. I will compare to theMonster ClarityHD Precision Micro Bluetooth Speaker 100 Portable Bluetooth Speaker (MBL CLY SPKR BT)at some points.Pros:-Great design, looks fantastic (I like all the colors except red, but I really liked the ""grill"" on the grey one).-Very minimalistic, simple, and elegant. Follows an ""Apple"" product theme. It has only 3 buttons, and the on/off switch.-Sound Quality is good. This is a small speaker so its never going to be amazing, but I find it rather good for the size. This speaker shines in having good High/Lows, a very rich sound, and really good Bass. In comparison to the Clarity HD which I also tried, the sound is much richer. Though the Clarity HD does indeed have good clarity, the Jambox is as good in that sense as well.-Very easy to use, pairing is incredible fast and simple (after I got it out of the box it was paired in maybe 15 seconds).-Has a website where you can download some small features (kind of useless) but also new firmware and technology that is improving the sound of the Jambox such as ""Live Audio"". Live Audio (i think) separates the Left and Right more and I do indeed think it improves the sound, but it comes at the cost of having a lower Maximum volume. More on volume below.-10 hour battery life. I never actually checked this and I seriously doubt it's 10 hours, but it's much higher advertised than the other bluetooth speakers, so it's safe to assume that the batterlife even if not 10 hours, is still much longer than other speakers like the Clarity HD.Cons:-Loudness. I think the loudness of this speaker is mis-advertised as I was a little bit dissapointed. At home, this thing is great. Easily fills my room, and when I turned it up downstairs, you could still hear it Upstairs in different rooms. If you want the better sound with Live Audio, it is ~2-3 volume levels (Clicks of the button) less, so it is quite a bit. When I took this to a social function with about 15 people all in a room, you could hardly hear some songs when people were talking. This also however depends on the song itself. I think if you were to turn up most songs in Itunes (Volume wise) above 100%, they would still sound good (not distorted). So I hope that the volume cap is put higher in a update (which is why updates are a very nice feature). The Clarity HD gets much louder, but once again the sound is a lot worse. If volume is crucial for you, the Clarity HD might be a nice option (Check out my review on it). Overall I think most people are going to be satisfied with the volume, and if you really need a boost, you can connect the device by wire and the sound gets MUCH louder, as loud if not louder than the Clarity HD on bluetooth.Edit: Along with LiveAudio, there is also a feature called ""Sound Clarity"" which once again, says it will improve audio sound at the cost of some volume, when LiveAudio is DISabled. So I had both these features enabled therefore I didn't have maximum sound. So this device CAN get a little bit louder than I thought. I still think the choice between volume and sound quality is a nice one, however to change this you need to connect to a computer, so this cannot be easily shifted on the go.-Price, $200 is a lot but the market for these devices is quite high as it is. The Clarity HD is twice as cheap on Amazon right now, but as i said before, I got my Jambox for $150 so that made a huge difference in my mind. For $50 more, I would hands down prefer the Jambox over Clarity HD. For $100, the question becomes more clouded. If you have the money and are willing to spend it, you will not feel bad about spending $150 as I think you will be very satisfied with the Jambox, it's just got a pleasing feel to it.(This isn't really a con, but a concern) -Portability: Im not certain how portable this is. Its really small and easy to carry but you do need some kind of bag, as its awkward to just carry in your hand. You do get a nice case with it. The best option without an extra bag is I guess a decently big jacket pocket would fit it. It is portable but I think its kind of peculiar to carry around, if you have Purse or some kind of backpack or anything, that problem is dissolved.Conclusion: This is a great product though it is quite pricey. It has really good sound quality and bass for its size and purpose. I am concerned about how loud this could get in a very loud enviornment, but I suspect for most people, it will be good enough. The firmware updates make this kind of problem solvable, and leave the Jambox with room to improve. The design and features are really nice. Compared to the Clarity HD, I think the reviews are misleading. The Clarity HD has notable MUCH worse sound quality, but it does get louder and is cheaper. The firmware updates are a nice touch and give you options for better sound, which is also very nice. In every other aspect such as design and battery life, the Jambox is also supreme.Extra-Topical: My Jambox is actually going to be RMA'd beacuse it has some kind of glitch or is defective, but a few times, the Bluetooth connection would just be a random sound, like a signal, but it wouldnt play any music and would make weird crackling sounds. The wire would still play music however. Recently I could barely even get bluetooth to play music, rather than these weird sounds as if it were broken, so this is a big problem. I am hoping this is just my unit so its not impacting the review, but if my new one has this problem, I may make an edit.Also, this isnt really a connectivity drop because it isnt silence, its this weird droning noise. But on the topic of connectivity. Ive never had a drop on my Itouch even while walking downstairs which the Jambox is upstairs. However, my sisters IPhone 4G had like 4 drops in one session of listening. Im not really sure what caused the connection loss and I dont know if its specific to the Iphone 4G but this may be a problem. Never happend to me though.

B003LR7ME6,great,How do you like the texture?,"I bought this case to protect my iPad 3. Overall, it appears to be a good case, though I have a number of quibbles with it. I have had the case only a few days, so these are initial impressions.Good stuff: The case fits the iPad 3 very well. It is a bit snug, perhaps; I have seen some reviewers complain about this, but I consider it to be an advantage. The auto-on-off switch, activated by a magnet when the case is closed, works just fine. My primary concern was that the case would hold the iPad securely, without slipping, especially when being used as a stand in the upright position. The case I bought for my original iPad failed in this regard. The new case, however, uses a velcro closure that feels very secure. It does not slide around in the case at all.Neutral stuff: The buttons on the side of the unit are not easy to reach, but that is more a function of the design of the iPad rather than the case. Exposing the buttons would require exposing more of the iPad, which would not be a good design decision (IMO). Be advised that while the product literature suggests that this case is made of leather, it isn't. I knew that when I purchased it, so that wasn't an issue for me. However, if anyone is led to believe that this is a leather case, be assured: it isn't. The case features a hand strap on the back of the flap, for use when the flap is folded around. I have not found a good way to use this flap, so I consider it a neutral feature. (YMMV) Finally, I have not used the stylus loop, and I don't plan to, so I have nothing to say in that regard (except that it successfully stays out of the way if you don't care to use it).Bad stuff: This case is heavy. I was surprised at how heavy it is. With the case, it gives up any gains in weight that it had over the original iPad; in fact, I believe the iPad 3 with this case weighs more than my iPad 1 in its case. This is only an issue when I am supporting the iPad in my hands, but it is noticeable at those times--and annoying. Also, this case smells. It has a chemical, fake-leather smell that is unpleasant and sticks to your hands. I expect that the smell will fade over time (I have used fake leather steering wheel covers in my car, and they have the same problem), but for now, it's yet another annoyance. Finally--and this is little more than a quibble--the angles at which the iPad sits when the case is used as a stand are not quite to my liking. The angle in the upright position is too steep, and the angle in the leaned-back position is too shallow.Summary: I gave this case four stars, and I would recommend it to a friend. Of course, I would inform him of the disadvantages that I have noted in the review. However, they do not outweigh the advantages of the case (again, IMO). ANSWERNOTFOUND",good case,"(69, 78)"

B000062VUO,clear,How is the speaker clear?,"Let me preface my review by saying that I am no ""audiophile.""  While I do have electrical engineering knowledge and understand many of the specs that can be compared amongst speaker sets, I cannot discern some of the subtle differences that true audio technicians can.  On the other hand, I am also picky about sound quality and am able to immediately notice many aspects of speaker design based on how they affect the sound of a song.With that said, my appraisal of the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 system is a 5-star rating.  These high-quality speakers are excellently designed, admirably built, and deliver outstanding sound quality whether they are used with music, movies, or video games.First off, the speakers themselves are wonderful.  Featuring strong midrange drivers and bright ""horn style"" tweeters (a Klipsch tradition), they deliver the full range of frequencies contained in a typical audio track.  In this regard they surpass competition such as Logitech, which lacks good midrange abilities.  The Klipsch speakers are good enough to draw out flaws in lower quality audio tracks, which can be mildly annoying, but is a great testimony to the quality of the drivers and filters.Now, the subwoofer.  I demand GOOD bass from my music.  I hate deafeningly loud, boomy bass units that obscure the higher frequencies and irritate everyone within a half mile radius.  On the other hand, weak bass drivers that rattle and vibrate or distort when the music is turned up are also an abomination.  The Klipsch subwoofer, which runs at 50 watts continuously and can peak at 130 watts, is perfect for in-home audio use.  While it probably would not be sufficient to overcome road noise in a car (I have a 150 watt subwoofer there), it is more than ample for a home theater system.  I absolutely love the sound of the bass from this thing; while it is ported, which generally makes for boomier bass, the Klipsch unit does deliver very tight, clean bass.  A former roommate who was arguably much more of an ""audiophile"" than myself even commented with approving surprise about the great resonance the sub has at low frequencies.  Again, this sub might appear to be weak at only 50 watts RMS, but it is MORE than sufficient.  If you turn up the volume loud enough to start distorting or rattling the subwoofer, you will be completely deafened by the satellites.Features are where the Klipsch speakers lose a few points from the overall rating...but not very many.  Like most computer speakers, they feature a decently lengthy input cord (1/8"" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack), headphone port, and volume adjustment on the primary satellite.In addition, three features stand out as especially nice.  First, there is an additional input port (female 1/8"" [3.5mm] stereo mini-jack) which means you can play music and video games at the same time, for example.Next, the speakers are connected to the amplifier/subwoofer unit via detachable 2-wire speaker cords, NOT hardwired cords.  This means you have a lot of flexibility in the placement of the units; additionally, the included wires are very long.  If they aren't long enough, you could also solder an extra length of ordinary speaker wire to the amplifier end because they simply clip into place.  The satellite ends have 1/8"" jacks on them which plug firmly into the back of the satellites.Lastly, the subwoofer can be fully adjusted via a knob on the primary satellite, meaning you can turn it down or even off without affecting the volume of the music.  This is great in apartments and dorms where the bass is OK during the day but must be toned down at night to avoid disturbing people.The one feature of the set that is NOT a plus would be the placement of the power switch.  In order to prevent that awful popping noise that occurs when you power up a speaker set remotely (such as by flipping the switch on a power strip), you'll want to use the unit's built-in power switch.  Unfortunately, this is located on the back lower part of the amplifier/subwoofer, under the wiring connections and generally in a place where you will have trouble reaching.  Usually, the sub gets tucked away under a desk or in a corner, and thus the switch location is rather terrible.  Logitech systems, for example, often have a remote or hardwired control pod which includes power and volume controls.Build quality on the speakers is also a plus.  The subwoofer is sturdy and rugged MDF, with a quality black coating and a firmly attached rear amplifier panel.  The satellites are injection molded plastic, but it is thick and strong, and the bases (which can be removed for optional wall mounting) are coated metal.  I have had the speakers for several years now and they have never once acted up on me or required repair.All in all, the Klipsch Promedia 2.1 set is a phenomenal, spectacular set of speakers for a relatively cheap, 2.1 style unit that was designed with computer audio in mind.  With a few adapters, you can easily use this with your TV, XBox, and many other devices, as I currently do.  Again, larger home audio units will provide better and louder sound, but these will also cost a great deal more.  I would highly recommend these speakers to anyone who needs a compact setup but demands good quality sound. ANSWERNOTFOUND",quality speakers are excellently designed,"(531, 572)"

If you keep them at a moderate volume no one else can hear what you are listening to. They are very durable and I now own three pairs for various locations.

B0034XRDUA,expensive,Do you have a price for a shoes?,"I purchased this mouse (not from Amazon) to go with theLogitech K350 2.4Ghz Wireless Keyboard.  Both use the unifying receiver so one receiver for both keyboard and mouse- yay!  Or so I thought...  Unfortunately, this mouse was defective and I had to return it.  Due to the poor quality of the mouse I received along with other reviews having similar issues, I decided to go with a different mouse then to try my luck again with this one.Issues:Did not track accurately.  Tracking is sporadic.  It would appear to work properly, then not at all.Did not click accurately.  Had to click several times for the mouse to work.Tried changing mouse pads, no pad, putting a piece of paper underneath.. nothing helped.  The logitech software was the current, updated version.  What's sad is that when I went to return it, the tech at Staples (where I bought it) tried to test it and it wouldn't even work on his PC.  At least on mine, it somewhat worked.  The tech's PC did recognize it and yes, the mouse was turned on.  The pointer just wouldn't even move.I had major challenges with finding a mouse to work for my needs.  I finally settled on this one due to the following:Right size for my small handsErgonomicSomewhat ambidextrous.  I am left handed but typically use the right hand for the mouse (gee I wonder why that is.. gripe, gripe, gripe about the lack of good left handed mice!)  I could get away with using it in my left hand if needed (due to nerve pain I have to switch between my left and right hand as needed) but not for long term use.Had the unifying receiverFeatures: Had all the features I could possibly want or need.  I loved the hyper scroll and application switcher.  The buttons were unobtrusive and I never hit them unintentionally.I tested several other unifying receiver mice made by logitech and this was the one that fit my ergonomic needs the best.  TheLogitech Wireless Anywhere Mouse MX for PC and Macdoes have a good selection of features but it was too small.  TheLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Macwas too big and not at all for left handed use.  TheLogitech LX7 Cordless Optical Mouse - Dark Blue ( 931395-0403 )is my backup mouse and is OK and theLogitech Wireless Mouse M505 (Black)was the next choice if just going off of ergonomics and comfort, but for the price and lack of features I decided to look outside of Logitech.What I found instead was theMicrosoft Explorer Mini Mouse.  This mouse fit similarly to the M705 and it is MUCH lighter and MUCH cheaper!  It also works better in my left hand then the M705.Like I said in my title, I wanted to love this mouse but it was so defective I didn't even want to try a second one.

B001G5ZTLS,new,How did you like the camera?,"I am SOO glad I own this productUpdate Aug 2011... I got an err70 code which required the camera be returned to Canons service center in Irvine CA. I called them up and explained the issue. They gave me free shipping (to print from the printer) for UPS so I packed it up and sent it off to Canon with a letter where I told them how much I loved the camera (I think my compliments and not being pushy made a very big difference). The camera was 2 years old with well over a 100,000 clicks. I receive the news the cost would be about 200 for the repair. When I went to pick it up Canon replaced the shutter and board restoring the camera to like new condition. It would have been fair to bill me more than 1000 for these repairs since the camera was well used and 1 year past the warranty but they didn't. The gentleman explained that by looking at the camera it was obvious it was not dropped or exposed to abuse and because it was a computer issue they would extend this courtesy. THANKS Canon,  I am a LOYAL customer for life.  Makes me feel great about the over 10k investment in your product!  Nice to see a big corporate company look out for their customers.Since the original purchase 2 years ago I have purchased a 2nd 5D, and 6 prime lenses. I was curious if this would be a passing phase but it was not.  I have gotten a lot of pleasure from this camera and continue to do so.The Canon Mark ll 5D is EXCEPTIONAL, anyone who says the 21.1 MP is overkill is underestimating the ability of cropping wildlife photos to the smallest part taken at a far distance.  I can still find sharpness in the smallest possible section of the focused part of a photo. It really is incredible; the vivid monitor's sharpness tells the whole story without dumping the large files onto a laptop. The edge of a ruffled bird's feather, the sunlight on the corner of a leave is still noticeable and sharp with 21.1 MP. Because you can ""double check"" the sharpness prior to snapping the photo using the LCD, you are saving yourself lots of editing (and space, the files are huge) on the computer. This instantly makes you a better photographer and frees up more time taking pictures instead of editing them. Also, if you manage to take fewer photos but better ones, this can make the extra space for these larger 21.1 MP pics (about 28mb)  on your computer's hard drive about a draw.I used for the first time a 100-400 IS lens and after 10 minutes of practice have taken better photos than ever before. The 180 Macro lens takes pictures like a microscope capturing the infinite details of nature hidden from the human eye. Adding the 21.1 MP factor makes your possibilities practically unlimited. If you do not use L series lenses or better, and do not have the budget for these lenses, wait and do not buy this... you will only be torturing yourself by not having them, they are a must have. It would be like driving a Ferrari on rims.Because the AF (auto focus) mode adjusts so many functions including the ISO, an amateur like me can enjoy taking photos while not being concerned about the settings I promised myself I would learn. I just can't put the camera down long enough to read up on it! As promised this camera is excellent in very low light with the noise factor eliminated or greatly reduced. Amazing the way the 5D picks up light at night, just amazing. Once you take pictures at night with this camera, no other camera will do.Also, for anyone wanting to learn more about this camera, (and really any other camera like it) Youtube ""Canon Mark ll 5D"" and you will find about 20 knowledgeable videos of pros doing hands on demonstrations, comparing similar models, and offering priceless tips about functions you never knew the camera had. This, along with Amazon's testimonials proved invaluable in my decision to buy. If you would like to see the manual ahead of time visit Canons website [...]I was initially concerned that the camera may be a little complicated since I moved directly to this higher end camera after using the smaller Canon SD cameras and snapping pics with my friends Rebel 300d. The 5D is quite simple and once you use it, you will be hooked.I also recommend a Hyperdrive, a hand held device up to 160 GIG (about twice as heavy as an iphone and a little thicker) that you can quickly dump the photos from a memory card onto. This will save you money on buying multiple memory cards and lugging around a heavy laptop on weekend trips, after all you can use the freed up space and less weight in your backpack for more lenses.Battery life is impressive and it seems you can do over 900 pics on one charge with LCD and probably 2 or 3 times as much without it.I tried to talk myself into a lower cost camera with less mega pixels. I wanted to say I would get a regular HD video camera that had more performance features later. I relented and ponied up for the 5D and realized that for me personally it was worth the extra bucks. Very nice LCD screen and HD video in one unit. Hopefully this will delay my desire for a better camera and after seeing the impressive resale value of used L series lenses, surprisingly close to cost of new (I bought all used Lenses on Craigslist that look new) and the cameras, I felt the investment would offer future returns I could not pass up.

Seeing the tape I used to build up the end had compressed a lot under the camera battery's retention clip, I improved that fix and the charge and retention are back.  After a thousand flash-less test pictures there is power left in the charge from a few weeks ago.  Still One Star for the size flaw, tho ********** Update 3/25/2012  -  Seems to Run Out of Juice Awful Quick. . .Now I question this Brand's Total Charge and/or Retention. I've had better all-round luck with Power2000 *****I bought this extra battery for my Olympus Stylus with high hopes since a different battery from a different ""No Name"" brand works well in my Canon camera.  On arrival the battery looked just like the Olympus original but when I put it in the camera nothing happened.Since rechargable batteries usually arrive with enough charge to at least turn on the equipment, I wondered if the thing was DOA.  I tried charging the battery several times in the camera without success in any way.  Again I figured DOA.For some reason I eventually tried pressing the battery down lightly inside the battery compartment with my finger and turning the camera on.  ...It worked...  And it worked fine every time I tried it.When installed, the battery is a ""hair"" too short to touch the contacts inside the battery compartment.  The original Olympus battery has NO HINT of this problem.  I roughly compared the Olympus and Maximal batteries side by side.  If there is any difference in length it is very small but apparently enough to cause an issue.I imagine the problems with the battery having no power seen here in a few negative reviews could be from a lesser degree of the same issue, where the power connection is flawed during use or charging so one suspects the thing is no good.The work-around is to build up the end of the battery with tape or something, though such a fix could make switching batteries a real pain given the tight clearances in the battery compartment.I decided to exchange the battery and hope the replacement meets the original spec. better.  I'm encouraged by it's vast majority of 4 and 5 Star reviews.  The battery was provided by Amazon and I managed to discover the problem within Amazon's Return Window so at least the return is going smoothly, supposedly with no extra cost to me for shipping the battery back and receiving it's replacement.The replacement arrived and has the same problem.  Using several layers of scotch tape, I built up the battery end where the tiny clip holds it in the camera.  The battery seems to work fine now while still slipping in and out of the camera easily.The package has a Support number to call.  The person I spoke with didn't know of any problems like mine and recommended I return the battery to Amazon AGAIN and ...get this... TRY AN DIFFERENT BRAND.  AND though it also is marketed for other manufacturer's cameras, this replacement is SUPPOSED to be an EXACT match for the Olympus model my camera takes...It even has the same Model Code on the package (LI42B).Subsequently I was looking at replacements for a Canon NB-6L battery and saw many 1 Star ratings for MaximalPower's NB-6L battery noting that the thing was TOO BIG to fit, although otherwise that battery also has a high rating.

My only complaint is no optical zoom during movie mode (only digital, which distorts the picture).  Shoots well in low lit areas when using flash, otherwise pictures are a bit grainy.  The camera is very attractive in design and small enough to take on the go.  Battery life is average, but it only take 90 minutes for a full recharge!  I'm glad I purchased this instead of the Sony w290. ANSWERNOTFOUND",simply fantastic,"(15, 31)"
B00452V66G,easy to set,What do you think about the camera?,"For the price, this S-Link camera seems to be a great value. It does not promise to be a whole-house security system with real time recording, etc. If you want that, look elsewhere and expect to pay more.But what you do get is a very good camera with high quality imaging that can be set up quickly and accessed by an easy to use app.I installed this camera in a matter of minutes on my home system (Mac based). The installer really was a breeze. The free iPhone app also installed quickly and in less than 10 minutes after opening the box I was monitoring my kitchen and living room on my iPhone.Daytime-mode images are nice and crisp, and the night-time images are also very good and seem to have a range well beyond the 15 feet D-Link indicates (perhaps I have more ambient light in my area at night). You can also connect the camera by cable or wifi, but wifi seems to be by far the best choice as then you have much more flexibility as to where to place the camera.Other reviewers have complained that without a recording feature the camera isn't very useful, as you would have to be watching the feed all the time to see if anyone was breaking in, messing with your stuff, etc. However we have a good home alarm system and if it ever went off we would be notified immediately, which would allow me to turn on the app and check the camera right away. The app also includes a photo option, so you can take still photos from the D-Link camera that are saved to your Photos app (on the iPhone/iPad anyway).Two minor issues were 1) the iPhone app sometimes doesn't connect to the camera, and needs to be restarted to get the feed; 2) there is a 2-3 second delay in the feed, so it is almost but not quite ""real time"" (this may be a function of network speed, cell-phone distance, etc.). And of course, should your network go down, the camera is useless. But that almost goes without saying.For the price, this is a good-quality camera. It requires manual monitoring but unless you are willing to pay much more for a hard-drive based surveillance system, in this price range the D-Link camera is a very good option.

B004J3V90Y,perfect,How is the camera?,"Wow.  This camera is amazing.  This is my first dSLR camera and I might as well have never been taking pictures when I had my point-and-shoot.  I wanted a camera that was capable of actually taking useable pictures indoors and also have a touch of zoom on it.  This does both great.  I can't believe the quality and clarity indoors, even at night.  With hardly any lights on it can take crisp photos with ease.  I was able to zoom across a dimly lit 40-foot room, use the flash, and read the serial numbers off my camera's box!  Amazing.The standard flash seems to work pretty well.  I'll probably get an external flash eventually, but the one it comes with works great.  Seems to be pretty powerful.  I haven't tested it outside at night yet, though.I've only played with the video capabilities briefly.  You set it up by finding your focus point and then roll from there.  It keeps the focus well and only small adjustments are needed when depth in your focused subject changes.  Might take a little work knowing when and how to change the focus during some action shots but eventually the non-autofocus throughout the video could end up being a positive rather than a negative due to customizing capabilities.The camera seems solid, but very light.  I couldn't believe the difference between this camera and my dad's 60D (which had a smaller lens on his as well).  It seems significantly lighter.  I thought this was a great feature since I'll probably use the camera a lot on the go.The functions of the camera make sense.  While I'm just a beginner, there seems to be a lot of room to learn with the camera.  The ease of use is easy enough for my wife to follow without having to learn all the intricacies to shooting a manual shot.  Yet all the manual capabilities are there when you want it.The live view screen is large, bright, and crisp.  Very easy to read in any light setting.Overall, I LOVE the camera.  While I would probably love any dSLR just coming from a point-and-shoot, the features of this camera are what attracted me to it.  It is light, powerful, and easy to use with flexibility to grow.  With such a powerful sensor for pictures and 1080p video capabilities, I feel this camera will be in my bag for many years to come. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This camera is amazing,"(6, 28)"
B002RL875A,little,What is the small problem?,"So I have been using my Sony universal remote that costs $60.  It was a decent remote and does have 1-button turn on multiple systems option.  I would say it covers 95% of my need, but when I see this nice touch screen universal remote from Logitech that requires internet/software to sync up, I thought maybe I should pay $160 for the touch screen, and given that it would always have the latest update, it must cover all the edge cases and 100% of my need!  Well boy was I wrong--I didn't even get 1% out of this remote!First I am fairly comfortable w/ computer and I have never had issues installing/updating any software, so it's surprising to me that they can screw this up.  But after running into the below issues, I am going to return it (nope, not going to waste time calling their CS)1.  First issue:  It could find my DirecTV DVDR and I need to get the remote to teach it (hey my Sony UR needs to do this too--without any software!  But fine, I did play along)2.  After configuring the software w/ all the  devices, I try to update the H1 remote.  The update got stuck at 3%.3.  It recommended me that I disable my anti-virus and firewall (already off).  So I did and tried again.  Same problem.4.  Googled ""harmony one stuck at 3%"", turns out it's a common issue (so common that when I typed ""Harmony one st"" it autocompletes ""Stuck at 3%"").  There's supposed to be an alternate way to update using a website (If that's the case, why do I need to install the software on my computer!?)5.  Unfortunately, even using the website, the install still stalled at 3%.  I could probably try to reboot my PC and see if that would make a difference, but nope Logitech I am not going to waste more of my time to fix your product.  Path of least resistance to earn your customer, and you have failed my friend.There was another reviewer (who was lucky enough to actually use the remote) who said he could do all the H1 functions w/ his Sony UR without all the fancy software, by pressing 3-digit codes for each device manufacturer.  I couldn't agree more!  Why not just keep it simple?  I have bought many crappy products before, but this is the first time that a product fails to be even set up!!

B004O6MN7E,nice,How is the tv?,"I've had this TV for about a week now and it has fantastic picture quality, its also not heavy at all, while I did move the TV around by myself I wouldn't recommend if you are more than a few feet. The TV is incredibly thin, if you get a ultra-thin wall mount (got mine from Monoprice) the distance of the front panel to wall is about 3 inches. Since the remote has a QWERTY keyboard I thought it was going to be very large, however the form factor and size of the remote is very decent. The 240hz motion is a requirement, my friend has a 120hz recently purchased TV and I could immediately tell the difference.PROS: thin profile, smart applications, DLNA, QWERTY remote, 240hz motionCONS: QWERTY remote usability is not integrated into all applications (example QWERTY doesn't work with Youtube app). Thin profile (yes this is a negative as well): all manufacturers that make thin profile TVs should consider separate component units so that you only have to run 1 wire (power + data) to the TV. The thin profile of the TV makes it very difficult to access and modify cables once its wall mounted. The USB ports are definitely inaccessible once the TV is mounted (recommending plugging in a USB extender cable ahead of time)**I got an ultra-thin wall mount and since there's barely 1inch clearance behind the TV you HAVE to dismount the TV in order to modify cable connections, unless you have a retractable wall mount I don't think its possible to make any cable modifications without dismounting the TV. Also I got 24AWG HDMI cables, which are awesome cables but make it more difficult to use with a thin profile TV and ultra-thin wall mount. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The TV is incredibly,"(198, 218)"

B00G4UQ6U8,similar,How was the sound?,"I have been extremely pleased with Brainwavz S1 headphones. I have not been very impressed with any of the in-ear headphones I have tried in the past due to lack of comfort and poor sound quality. Brainwavzs has a developed a product that has addressed these areas and offers more.Firstly, the ear buds fit comfortably and don't tug on the ears. After an hour of wearing these headphones, my ears still feel fine.  The company includes several different options for inner ear tips. It is trial and error to find the ones that work for you. Secondly, the sound quality is great for my uses. I tried these on an airplane to watch a movie and during a work out to listen to music. As advertised, the bass and vocals were clear and not overbearing. Though they didn't cancel sound as the bulkier headphones do, but the sounds quality was impressive while on the airplane. To note, I did not try any tips other than the tri-flange tips during the plane trip. Additionally, when the outside of the earbuds are rubbed or brush against something during sound play, the sound is not impacted.Some added features that add to this product are the flat wires that cut back on tangling. This seems to work well. They did not require any untangling when getting them out for use. The hard earphone carrying case is great and small.Overall, this is an excellent product. They offer excellent sounds quality in a compact size and an affordable price. I recommend these for anyone searching for good quality ear buds.

B004QK7HI8,not good,Does this product is good quality?,"We were trying to live simply and watch less television. We also wanted to save some money by discontinuing our Dish Network service. At first, I was thinking about purchasing an external HDTV antennae but was daunted by the installation. I then decided to look at indoor antennas and came across the Mohu Leaf. I was intrigued that it got excellent reviews. I wasn't very hopeful because of our location. I live in Apex, NC and our subdivision is surrounded by a lot of trees and we get poor AT&T; cellphone service. But I was encouraged that Mohu has a great return policy. I figured that if it didn't work, I will just return it.I plugged it into my HDTV and had the television do a channel search. The first time I did this, I did not get a lot of channels but after moving it a couple of times (and having my TV do another channel search after each move), I was able to get 19 channels! Among a few minor channels, I got the major networks including PBS, CBS, ABC, Fox, NBC, and The CW. And guess what, at normal viewing distances, the picture quality is comparable to Dish!I'm even contemplating of buying a DVR. There are a few devices that don't even require a monthly subscription. But I'm still thinking about this. It's very tempting to be able to record all the network shows like Fringe, Desperate Housewives, or Dancing with the Stars. My main goal, after all, is to watch less television.Very soon, I will cancel my Dish service and this $44 antennae is going to save me lots of money. ANSWERNOTFOUND",and watch television,"(30, 55)"

B00007E7JU,good,Does the optics good?,"First EF lens I've ever owned. It's fast (considering I just upgraded from FD, basically), has great optics, works great as a portrait lens. I dispute claims that it's noisy, as it sounds quite silent next to the sound of my 20D's shutter.Unfortunately it feels like it came out of a cereal box. The lack of a metal mount makes me wonder. And I worry that my lens doesn't say ""MADE IN JAPAN"". Still, the day I got it it fell off my printer onto the floor, about a four foot drop, which it survived entirely without a scratch... we'll see how that goes. One major ergonomic disadvantage, apart from the fact that in your hands the lens feels like something that came out of the cereal box, is the fact that the focusing ring is, like, right at the end of the lens, and is easily turned while holding the lens. I don't have a hood yet, so I sometimes run into problems when I'm holding the lens. ANSWERNOTFOUND",has great optics,"(91, 107)"

The dynamic range seems very compressed around the vocal frequencies with the higher frequencies the most affected although the bass is also weak. Virtually none of my music sounds good.

B003GIJTR8,great,How is the earphone?,"Note:  These have an excellent, no-hassle warranty.  Skullcandy will replace them for any reason, whenever - just go to their website, register your product, and fill out the warranty form.  You will receive CREDIT for their website that you can use on whatever you like, as well as free shipping.  The amount of credit will depend upon the current price of your product on THEIR website - so for the standard INK'D buds, you will get a $20 credit.  You do not need any proof of purchase, and it does not matter how much time has passed - just pop the broken buds into a small envelope and you're good.Firstly, I want to mention a few important tidbits that you should know.1.  Pay attention to the L and R (engraved on the stem) on these earbuds, which can be hard to see.  Do not reverse them, as doing so can affect fit and sound quality.  I find putting a piece of colored tape on the right cord makes life easier.2.  Don't assume you know which gel size will fit you best; make sure you try on all 3 gel sizes that come with these, as using the wrong size can dramatically decrease sound quality and comfort.  If your earbuds are uncomfortable or the sound quality does not meet your expectations, then you likely have the wrong size gel installed.  For myself, I automatically went with the smallest size because my ears are small, but those made the earbuds sound like cheap garbage.  It wasn't until I tried the next size up did I get the full quality of sound that these are designed for.  So pay attention to this, since it really matters.3.  These have a straight plug, not an L-shaped plug.  So you will need to be extra careful as a straight-plug design increases the amount of pressure both on the plug, and the headphone jack of your player.  This leads to frayed wires or a loosening of the headphone jack, or both, which ultimately lead to the classic problem of only one side having sound.4.  The cord is long - measures approximately 4 feet, 5 inches.5.  Burn-in works with these.  Slightly.Now, as for the build quality - I'm impressed.  They are not cheaply made earbuds, despite their low price.  The wires are nice and solid, and feel very well made - not flimsy or plastic-y.  The silicone gels (tips that go in your ear) are very soft and pliable, and even have the Skullcandy logo engraved on them.  Nice touch.They feel good, too.  Really good.  Both the material, and the way they fit my annoyingly small ears.  And they don't fall out constantly, although I do sometimes get the sensation that it's getting sucked into my left ear.And yes, these come with 3 different size gels.Sound is great.  These handle bass extremely well for mid-tier earbuds, and highs aren't so shrill and piercing as with other comparable brands.  Some of this really depends on your player, too.  Even between iPods, sound quality does differ.As far as functionality goes, I find I am able to run with these with no problem.  The wires do not get tangled, and you can easily adjust the split in them with an attached slider (that has 'Skullcandy' written on it in the corresponding colour), which I find very convenient.  I do not hear this thumping sound that others claim to hear from wire-movement, so I can't confirm that.The only things I dislike are the straight plug, and the lack of a case.  Otherwise, I am thoroughly impressed with Skullcandy.  The craftsmanship, the quality of sound, and all the little extras that Skullcandy does that really lets you know that they are paying attention, and that they care about their products and end-users.Worth every penny.UPDATE 12/31/2011 - My current pair has seen daily use for over a year now with no issues.

It was one of the cameras recommended by Ken Rockwell, and one of the few low-end digitals that still has an optical viewfinder. My pragmatic daughter insisted on this, since sometimes in bright light the LCD is hard to view.The camera is tiny! Even after seeing a picture of the camera hiding behind a credit card I was not prepared for how small it is! The buttons are recessed and the whole camera slips easily into a pocket without snagging on anything. Despite its small size, the LCD is easy to view, and the buttons are very usable.The second moment of awe was powering on. The camera turns on and off very quickly! Some other point-and-shoot digitals we've had have had a considerable delay before they are ready to shoot, extending the lens and running through the self-test of the software. This camera is not quite instantaneous, but it's very fast!The pictures are good quality, and it's easy to switch between photo and video mode. Another fun surprise was that the auto-focus places the camera in macro mode when you try to focus on something right in front of the lens. In short, the features of the camera are very well done.I can't comment on the battery life or sturdiness/durability because we've only had the camera for a short time and my daughter is fastidious about taking out the battery when she isn't actively using the camera.

B001OMGVII,important,What is the importance of that feature to you?,"Pros:Voice recognition that actually works!  Very impressive VR works well.Very simple, easy to use interface.Great value at current pricing.Sleek, compact design.Screen is bright and easy to read.Free map updates (within 60 days of first use)Software updated to fix issues recently. (v4.70)FM transmitter -- though depends on your car.  Also has audio out/headphone jack.Can download lots of freebies like new voices, new vehicles, games, and so on.  (Some of the games aren't too bad.)Useful Pedestrian mode and ""last location"" feature (where did I park my car?), off road (find your way back to car after hunting/hiking in woods) and so on.Can optimize multi-stop routes for speed and efficiency (would be great for deliveries, for example).On board HELP.Cons:No printed manual.  Garmin can't include a proper printed manual?  Shame. They included plenty of color advertising brochures, cards, and such.No A/C adapter (optional extra) -- but you can use most any A/C to USB adapter.Even with latest map update, some new businesses in my area and a large development site not listed.Remarks:I just got my 855 and am quite happy with it.  I've only used it for trips around town, so far, so I need more time to give it a thorough test, but I thought I would go ahead and post some information which may be helpful to some of you. My initial impressions are good.  The user interface is probably the easiest to use of any of my GPS devices.  Screen is bright and clear.  Everything works as expected.In local trips, the tracking seems very accurate, no issues there.  The volume is adequate, but could be better.  Using the FM transmitter worked well for me and had enough volume.  Background static was only objectionable when the volume was turned up loud.  Even better, I tried using a cassette adapter which worked very well and gave great sound.  However, most of the time I just used the internal voice and speakers and they were acceptable.The Voice Recognition (VR) is the hot feature for this unit and I found it to work very well.  Quite impressive, actually.  It required no ""training"" and had a high degree of accuracy.  It is the best VR I've seen yet on any portable device.  Good enough to actually be useful.  One prime example, I can use VR to ""Zoom In"" and ""Zoom Out"" (merely by saying those phrases) of the map while driving.  I also found it worked very well to find locations on the fly.  For example, you can say ""Find Nearest Mexican Restaurant"" and it will show a list, then you just pick (by saying the number) and ""Go!"" -- very handy!  For the current price, this feature alone is worth the price of admission.So far, the navigation and routing has been fine, but I need to do more testing.  Battery power is good (3-4 hours) and the ability to pop the unit out of the cradle and take with you to use on foot (think hiking, hunting, parks, large malls, etc.) and the  ""find my car"" feature are nice pluses.  The ""Where am I?"" is also a very easy and useful way to add locations to your favorites list.I'll come back and add more after I've had more time using the unit.  Some more comments and tips below.  [If you find this review useful, please click on the ""Was this review helpful to you?"" Yes (or No) below and feel free to leave a comment or ask a question.  I'll do my best to answer those that I can. Thanks!]Comments:Found satellites and had good location within five minutes right out of the box in my family room.  Good receiver.Replaceable battery!  Can buy additional spares if needed (hiking, for example).VR works right off the bat - no ""training"" required.  Very accurate in my experience so far. (No VR system is perfect.)Free Voice Studio software allows you to record your own voice prompts!  I can see mischievous minds at work already. ;)Fast route calculations -- overall pretty snappy and accurateGood ""MyGarmin"" web site with lots of extras, FAQs and support info.Has jack for an external GPS antenna/receiver, though I doubt you'll ever need it.  Might be helpful in some trucks.On screen touch keyboard works well and is easy to use.Lets you easily create and save routes at home before your trip!  Some units I've had made this very difficult.  Very nice feature that is simple and easy to use.  Can save up to 10 Routes, each route can have multiple destinations and via points.  Shows you distance and time of travel for each route saved.  Very flexible.  The 855 will optimize routes so you visit destinations in the most efficient order.  Kudos, Garmin!Has on board HELPTips:-- Audio out/headphone jack provide an alternate way to get audio.  Can use external powered speakers, for example.  Many new cars have an audio in jack which will give better sound than via FM transmitter.  I tried using a cassette adapter (such as used to play mp3's via car radio) plugged into headphone/audio out jack and it worked very well.-- I tried various A/C USB chargers and all worked fine.  At first unit will go into ""PC connected"" mode, but if you wait 30 seconds or so, it will then switch to ""normal"" mode and you can use it as you normally would.  Will charge battery fine.  These chargers can be found for as little as $5 sometimes.-- You can press and hold battery icon to see more detailed information, such as per cent charged and even core temps. (Diagnostic display)-- I saw a tip somewhere online on how to adjust the internal mike gain to improve VR by decreasing the sensitivity to background noise.  Will update later on this,-- While at home, you can easily set/save the location in favorites as ""Home"" (Overcomes common problem of house number locations being a bit off, which affects all GPS units, by the way.)-- Amazon camera case (item No. ??? , insert link) fits this unit perfectly and has belt loop for easy carry. (Will update this info later.)-- Cancel VR button on remote works as ""back"" button on menus, too.-- Use 128 CBR mp3's (constant bit rate) for best results.-- Minimize background noises when using VR for best results.  (True with most VR gear.)-- After you do the map update, you still need to go to myGramin dashboard and check for the new software update.  Follow the instructions very carefully.  Takes awhile, but it works and will verify the update once done.-- You can fold a paper plate to make a bonnet to shield unit from sun (heat) ad make the display easier to read in bright sunlight (though I had no problems with this).  Heat may be causing some of the lockups others here have experienced.  (Punch holes and use rubber band to secure.)-  In cases where a city or street name can not be understood, use the 'spell' option in VR mode and spell the name.8/5/2010 Update:  Used this on a road trip this past weekend (200 miles) and it performed very well.  So I can verify a few more things:1)  Extremely fast recalculations if you deviate from the planned route.  So fast, you might not even notice it.  Fastest of any unit I have used.2)  Very fast satellite lock when you stop (i.e. turn off the car and GPS) and restart.  It will be ready before you are!3)  I used the VR extensively and it worked very, very well.  I had no problems even with the radio on (low) and some noise in the car.  Yes, a sharp or loud background noise might cause you to have to repeat a command now and then, but this actually happened only rarely.  Most of the time, it simply worked.  I have not seen any other GPS with VR this good and this complete (in terms of supported functions).  This was the most important feature for me and I am very pleased with it.  You can truly use this GPS hands free nearly all of the time.  And most importantly, *all* the functions you need while driving are supported. (Like zooming, accessing turn info, searching for POI's and so on.)4)  This trip was one I have taken many times, so I know the various routes pretty well.  I like to drive down one way and come back a different way.  On the way back, it found a new, faster route on a tricky section.  At first, I thought it was misdirecting me, but when I checked and then followed the new route, it was indeed a bit shorter/faster than the way I normally go and on as good or better roads.5)  The estimated arrival times were right on the money.6)  I used the built-in speakers most of the time and they were loud enough for me.7)  Very easy to use, no problems or issues.  The only other GPS I've used this good cost twice as much. Excellent at the main job of getting you where you want to go. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Very impressive VR works well,"(45, 74)"
B0058UUR6E,great,How good is the image of this camera?,"I bought this by accident.

B0001FTVEK,light,Is this one a good headphone choice?,"I can concur with the majority of reviews which heavily influenced me in buying these phones. I had previously used wireless RCA and Sony. These R120's are easily the best I've owned and tremendous value, PROVIDING you don't move your head, as they too easily shift and fall off your bonce (London lingo for head...).I was aware this may be a problem, but having a head as big as mine, I thought that would not affect me, but it does! These phones are very comfortable and ideal for sitting or relaxing listening to your sound. But forget doing housework or washing up (the dishes to you yanks!!:).They should have made these to at least have fitted your head so you can move around. So to summarise; if you want great sound, go for these great performing phones, if you want to move your head, forget it! I don't have the hiss problem by the way some people have complained of.I'm still pleased I bought them, the performance is brilliant considering the price. ANSWERNOTFOUND",These phones are very comfortable,"(435, 468)"
B0058UUR6E,clear,Are the images of very good quality?,"I am still getting used to this monitor, but what I see so far I like. My only complaint would be that it is so automated that I find it hard to do the simple things like adjust position. I will learn but right now it is set to full aspect with no selection available for position. I also find that with my old eye's I have to use explorer in 125% view mode to see the characters. Not a big deal as there is plenty of viewing space for 99% of the web pages.The image and colors are great. I use with HDMI mode and wireless push2tv.

It is very comfortable and stays put. Sound is great, although it lacks the bass from the large on ear sets. The clarity is great, never muddles anything, even when it is oversteered. My initial concerns with the thin wires has proven unfounded, as this set has endured very rough treatment without showing any signs of wear or degrading of sound.

B00DVFLJDS,sharp,How was the display?,"This is a review for Nexus 7 2013, 32 GB Wifi only model. This is a near perfect tab and what makes it even better is the price. It is light, perfect size which makes it so easy to hold it in your hand. Got a beautiful crisp display excellent brightness, great sound. The display is really great and you have to see it to feel the crispness and clarity. On the other hand this very same thing may not be so good for people with not so 20/20 vision. Fonts will seem smaller so be warned, though for me personally it is an excellent display.I have had this one for about 3 days now and battery life seems pretty good so far. I guess it is the combination of better hardware and the latest OS, but it feels so zippy and buttery smooth. My only gripe (well we do love to complain, dont we :-)). is that the top and bottom bezels, they make the tab look a bit weird shaped, like the iPhone 5, which I guess will take some getting used to. Other than that, it is best value for money, you can get right now. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The display is really great,"(268, 295)"

I had an iPhone 5 with a Zag protector before and it didn't feel nearly as nice as this one does. I had no idea that it could make this much difference. Seems like a small thing, but when you feel this one, you will know what I'm talking about -- it feels great to the touch! And the matte finish is excellent. I highly recommend this product.

B00001WRSJ,muddy,What did the bass became?,"Hello, This is my first review for the Sony MDR-V6 with CCAW Voice Coil.SoundFirst I would like to mention that these headphones sound pretty amazing. I've had bad headphones in the past that had terrible bass or treble, but for me its very well balanced. The only complaint about sound is that if you play any songs that has a lot of treble in it, it may not sound as comfortable in the high ranges. Some people mentioned about a &#34;boomy bass&#34; and I disagree. I think the bass is completely fine (I still need to go hear some hardcore bass drop of a dubstep though). I like bass a lot and I put my iPod with Bass Boost and it still sounds fine without being &#34;boomy&#34; or &#34;vibrating.&#34; I listened with my galaxy s4 and that sounded fine as well.ComfortSome people complained that the headband hurts while others say its comfortable. For me, It was pretty comfortable, but not as comfortable as I thought. At first, it's going to hurt the top of your head for a bit, but after you wear it for a couple of days the uncomfortable-ness goes away. Right now after 1 week, I don't complain about the headband at all. Just like any other over-ears it does get sweaty a bit, so don't wear it for too long unless you have air blowing in your face the whole time :P.BuildThe build is pretty solid, but the plastic on the sides makes it feel slightly cheap, but its not much to complain about. It's well built overall and it's portable which is a plus for me.AccessoriesIt comes with a bag that you can put your headphones in, which is pretty nice and unexpected. Also it comes with a 1/4&#34; screw on. Problem I had with this screw on is that when I took it back out, for whatever reason the 1/8&#34; connector bent in the middle slightly (maybe because I screwed it on too tight or something.) I just bent it back with the 1/4&#34; adapter putting it slightly in and bending it the other way and it was fine.OtherAnother thing I noticed was that the cable end doesn't really fit well into my s4 when it has its case on. I have to shove it in a little bit for it to go all the way in. Because it's also with a metal end(which makes it pretty solid instead of a cheap plastic one) I sometimes have problems connecting it to devices like the ipod and s4. But if you just give it a slight push then it should go all the way in. I wish the 1/8&#34; was a tiny bit longer so that it wouldn't have to be shoved in.Pros:- Great sound quality. For the most part balanced.- It's actually quite comfortable once you get used to it.- It's portable- It has the coiled wire so it doesn't tangle so easily- It comes with a convenient 1/4&#34; cable. I use it for my P-155 Yamaha Digital Piano.- It doesn't squish your ears, but isolates a lot of sound if you have sound running through the headphones.- Solid Metal endingCons:- High range in treble can get screechy (but that's if you go really high)- It is uncomfortable at first to the top of your head.- The wire is a little bit too long.- The metal end sometimes makes it uncomfortable to insert into devices like the iPod or your phone.tl;dr: it's very good product for headphones under $100. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This is my first review for the Sony MDR,"(7, 47)"
B008DWH00K,better,How are both sides with respect to the angle?,"When the Asus PA248Q 24 inch LED IPS monitor arrived overnight on my doorstep (You have to love Amazon Prime) I recieved a much better monitor than expected.  The monitor is packaged very well and arrived as expected.  There are good reviews on it.  Let me add a few things that I never saw listed.This is my fifth IPS monitor purchased in the last eight years.  I don't waste my time on TN glass.  Several things led me to the purchase of the Asus monitor: Overall good reviews, no coating smudges and the color gamut, and the USB 3.0 ports.  I considered the PA246Q monitor for a few more dollars but chose this one for the USB ports.It worked perfectly out of the box and the first noticable difference was the color.  It is incredible and it puts the colors on my old Gateway FPD2485W monitor to shame.  They run next to each other, the Gateway turned up for vertical use.  The Asus also runs much cooler - warm to the touch and nothing close to the Gateway furnace.  I suspect that it the LED that makes the difference.It had some unexpected surprises.  First, the bezel surrounding the screen is smaller.  The stand is well built and very sturdy. The monitor cannot wiggle around.  You can read about the ports.  And it has the picture-in-picture feature of the Asus 246Q monitor; somethingthat is not listed in Amazon's description of the product.  Better yet, I plugged in my USB 3.0 portable hard drive; it powered up easily and my computer quickly recognized it.  I used it all day with no problems.  I had not expected that.Setup is easy.  The colors are accurate.  I love the 5-way rocker switch.  I love the different adjustments it allows.  I suppose if there is a downside it would be that it is extremely bright even at the lowest settings.  But my aging eyes see it well and I am getting used to it.  White leans toward the blue part of the spectrum (LED again) but changing colors does not affect the white color or the black.  A black background on your screen seems ""shiny"" and deep compared to flatter monitors but it is easily covered with a dark grey or light black background.  The colors are so fantastic one might as well use photos instead.At 6ms refresh, there is no noticable ghosting in games.  That is pretty quick for an IPS monitor.  And again the colors make the game so much more immersive.Considering the fact that I spent over $600 on my last IPS monitor, I am going to buy another one and run them side by side.  My only disappointment was that Amazon lowered the price by $45 the day after it arrived.  Talk about bad luck.  Still, it is a great deal.  My advise:  Buy it.My last comment:  There were NO BAD PIXELS! ANSWERNOTFOUND",are good reviews on it,"(225, 247)"
B00829THK0,perfect,Was the drive absolutely perfect?,"When I buy hard drives, I buy them primarily based on their cost and speed. I don't care about any of their purported automatic backup programs and never bother installing them. For about $100 for 3TB, this is a good buy. USB 3.0 is plenty fast and even if your computer is older and has only USB 2.0, this drive will still work, albeit at a reduced speed.Seagate is a very reliable brand and have about 8 other drives in various capacities. None of them have given me any problems. The only times I've had hard drives issues was due to neglect and damage by me (snagging a USB cord and sending the drive crashing to the floor, for example). ANSWERNOTFOUND",plenty fast,"(233, 244)"
B0038W0K2K,not bad,How is the sound quality of this one?,"I'm very pleased so far. First, these earphones finally do stay in my ears during a workout, unlike any other earphone I have tried so far. They are comfortable and easy to adjust. They also come with  a semi-hard case that protects them in my gym bag.The sound quality is more than acceptable for the price point and, after a few uses, the sound seems to be improving (break-in effect?). So far no complaints,  would recommend for a workout earphone or for any purpose if, like me, you have trouble with earphones and earbuds falling off all the time. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The sound quality is more than acceptable for the price point,"(252, 313)"
B003VAHYTG,nice,How was the system?,"I liked these speakers a lot due to the fact that it has nice bass. The sound system itself is very good and has nice high's and lows. It's in a simple package and everything is easily connected so there should be no problem setting this up in no more than 5 minutes. I've had it for six months and the sound still sounds the same meaning the quality did not degrade, but there is a minor problem. Every time I do turn on the speaker, it makes a loud static noise which is annoying. Not sure if it's a product defect or if all speakers go through this phase. I've had this problem since the 4th month and was seeing if it persisted for a while and it seems like it's likely to be permanent. I have also never played shifted the &#34;Volume&#34; knob more than halfway. But other than that, the static noise is there reason why I took off a star, but other than that, the speakers itself pleased my ears and is still doing so. I do recommend these speakers if the static noise is not there and you can live with that. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The sound system itself very good,"(68, 104)"
B005S0XYKK,fantastic,What about color ?,"So far I am very satisfied with the monitors. These are actually my first IPS and I can say I am simply amazed and the picture. Before I go on let me post my settings because out of the box settings are the WORST and will make you want to return the item.Splendid: TheaterSharpness: 45Trace Free: 80ASCR: ONBrightness: 90Contrast: 78Saturation: 70Color Temp: User Mode with all colors maxedSkin Tone: NaturalSmart View: OffWith those settings everything should look great IMO. I actually bought 3 monitors because I am running SLI configuration for programming and for gaming. Because I have such a small desk, at the moment, I had to angle the monitors 75 degrees from the center monitor.  So if you can picture that in your mind, I want to say I have NO problem seeing anything. The colors still look great and gaming is just as fun. Only problem (this is not the monitors fault) is my head hurts from turning lol, just wanted to share that :PSome might ask if the 21 inch is too small. I can say I was worried about this too because I was using my PS3 3d display beforehand and can say that text is a fraction of a bit smaller. Unless you have really bad eyes, these monitors are perfect size. I also like the size because I have heard the bigger you go, the more you can see the LED backlight. In my case I can say on a totally black screen I see MINOR backlighting; nothing that would make the screen look awful, don't let that turn you away from the monitor.Some reviewers have had bad outcomes with dead pixels and what not, I bought 3. Not one of them has had any problem except for user error. This user error was I thought all 3 monitors were dead because when I ""touched"" the power button it didn't respond. Don't fall victim like I did, the power button is under the screen, it is not a fancy touch sensitive button like I thought, again user error. You have plenty of connection options except display port but that is alright because I prefer DVI and HDMI so it really is user preference. No speakers but again doesn't bother me, I use a headset. Lastly, the design is sleek but the stand feels cheap. Just touching the monitor a little and you will notice a bouncing effect (monitor rocks back and forth). This could have been made better but I don't plan on moving them or touching them so not a big deal breaker.So overall I am very happy with the purchase. The picture looks great at all angles, the frame rate if perfect (even for hardcore gaming, tested BF3 with ultra-settings, SLI 670s, and all three monitors in surround mode and it was PERFECT/BREATHTAKING), and the price couldn't be any more appealing for IPS. You will easily tell the difference from TN to IPS and you will never go back. Thank you for reading the review, if you would like to know more and any questions PLEASE leave a comment. I tend to check my amazon comments often and will do what I can to better help you.Posted pictures, comment if you need more or anything else. I also want to update that the first thing I did when I got these monitors was run over to YouTube and play a Dead Pixel Color Test. This allowed me to check every pixel and confirmed that all 3 monitors were flawless. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The colors still look great,"(781, 808)"
B002HWRJBM,replaceable,Where is battery ?,"Pros: Beautifully designed and built. From the perforated look rubberized area where your thumb rests to the brushed metal strips which arcs gracefully around the side of the mouse, to the low gloss plastic finish and the metal scroller wheel with rubber insert, it's a beautiful mouse, high quality mouse.It's extremely comfortable as well. Perhaps not quite as much as my old MX Revolution, but very close.Darkfield is extremely precise and works on every surface I've tried, from my shirt to my glass desk.This is the Cadillac CTS-V of mice.Battery is a removable and replaceable AA unit, a nice feature since internal battery failure caused the death of my MX Revolution.Charging is done via USB cable, so no down time.Battery life on its first full day of use is excellent, still 3 bars after hours of use.Have a middle mouse button again! Now shifting between the wheel modes is done via dedicated button.Nifty little travel casePlenty of programmablity.Cons: Cons are only a few.Forward/back/zoom buttons don't quite fall into reach as naturally as they did on the MX Revolution.Loss of shift-to-click. I'll miss this feature. Loved how the MX Revolution could be programed to switch from geared to free spin depending on how fast the wheel spun, then would switch back.Other Thoughts: My dear MX Revolution bit the dust on me a few weeks ago, due to internal battery failure, yet despite buying the original four years ago, Logitech replaced it with the new model.It's really worth saying that their customer support is superb, friendly, and helpful. They also send you return shipping labels now so you don't have to pay for shipping. Now that's progress. Turnaround was about 2 weeks total. I will continue to buy products from Logitech, they stand behind them.My only other minor complaint is the Application Switcher. I don't care for it...distorts the windows and when many are up it looks cluttered. But that's just a keystroke assignment away to set it back to Document Flip, so it's not an issue.Overall I love this mouse so far, and while I do miss my MX Revolution, this is a worthy successor. It's even better looking and very nearly as comfortable, very precise and works on surfaces the old mouse never could.Hopefully it will last!

B001BTCSI6,several,How was the camera?,"After researching the internet and visiting camera stores for hands-on experience, I chose D700 without regret. There are many people out there trying to make the decision of the 3 wonderful cameras. I can only share my analysis based on my need and experience, as an avid amateur photographer.D600: the solid pro-sumer body feels the same as D7000, which I also own. Nikon transplanted the FX heart into a DX body. It is very natural for D7000 owners to upgrade to D600 for the ease of use on functions and layouts. However, I dislike the AF system concentrating mainly in the center, which can be challenging when trying to focus under certain situations. In addition, the problem of the occasional oil spell/dust on the sensor issue can be an indication of quality control problem of this model. I have tried to clean camera sensors before; it is far from easy to do so, wet or dry method. Therefore, most professionals dissuade the general public to do so and recommend leaving the job to the authorized dealers. Believe me, it is beyond annoying when you see spots on your pictures; and sometimes the spots appear in the place that can be very hard to correct.D800: nice pro heavy body with a huge 36mp sensor. Upgrading from a DX, I can not justify spending (jumping) thus much on such a powerful camera. Instead, as most professional photographers suggest, I will spend more on quality lenses, which usually out-last the cameras. If you own D800, you'd better have pro lenses. Otherwise, all the ""defects"" will show up in pictures with its huge and powerful sensor. In addition, D800 also has its own quality control issues, which is back focusing. Also, as an amateur, I tend to shoot more pictures than the pros, making sure I get the pictures I want. Therefore, I end up with a good number of pictures after an assignment and it takes time to process them. I am not ready to store (space-wise) and process (time-wise) big files from the D800 yet... maybe much later.D700: I picked this ""old"" camera over the two new models. It is a pro body, weather sealed, similar weight to D800. The layout is not too different from D7000 (thank goodness!) and easy to get used to. Since it is discontinued, the price dropped to the level that it is quite affordable, especially used ones, though be careful with the ""used"" condition, as it varies A LOT! This is the trial-and-true cameras, a work horse for many professionals. Despite having an older sensor, D700 still can produce exceptional images with wonderful sharpness and color rendition. Pairing it with the right lenses, you get ""gallery"" quality photos/prints. I don't worry too much of the ""small"" 12 mp sensor. As an amateur, most of us don't print over 2'x3' anyway. Its renowned focus system is outstanding, right on everything every time I shoot!I care about the image quality (what my eyes can see), body built (how my hands feel), and the focus system (the first and foremost ingredient in sharp image). I believe all these 3 cameras are capable of producing excellent pictures. Currently, the D700 fits my need, my budget, and the overall quality I am looking for. After all, all the equipments are ""tools"" at best. It is the photographer that takes good or bad pictures. A soft but well-composed picture is not as bad as a sharp yet meaningless one.

I did try it out with my son's PS3...- It did connect.- It did work within the games for communication to the other remote players in the game- It WILL NOT also work to route 100% of the GAME SOUNDS and GAME AUDIO to the device.  Note:  This is NOT a limitation of the device, its the audio implementation on the PS3 consoles.  To route GAME AUDIO and In-Game Communication to a wireless headset, you need $250-500 bucks for the high end and uber-expensive Turtle Beach rig.2.  After lots of trial and error and comparing notes with those in the office that have one also...- The device that you are connecting it to, and its Bluetooth audio capabilities have A LOT to do with the call quality of it.- Via a computer with NATIVE Bluetooth or an aftermarket Bluetooth USB adapter... its still not going to sound as good as a Plantronics Blutooth device that has a custom audio functionality built in.  My Plantronics BT300M sounds like you are right there as far as your vocals to the person on the other end of the call.  It sounds like you.  It doesn't sound like a highly compressed tin can.  The LG HBS700 on the other hand... you are in a compressed, metallic sounding mode.- The device via a cell phone depends on the cell phone.  I recently switched from an LG handset to a Samsung Galaxy SIII and that made a HUGE difference.  The LG sounded tinny.  The Samsung sounds wonderful and realistic.Bottom line, this thing WEARS like a dream.  Battery life is incredible.  Music plays wonderfully.

B0001FTVEK,uncomfortable,What do you think about headphone?,"These headphones work great. They're Sennheisers and you usually can't go wrong with this brand.The headphone reproduces the full range of sounds very clearly and without distortion, if set up properly (I'll get to that).I've been able to walk around my home without experiencing too much distortion. Within the same room as the transmitter, the sound is really clear and robust. It's great not being tethered to one location or having to deal with accidentally yanking the cord out when moving around.Also, unlike my other enclosed-type headphones, the design allow for air to circulate freely. So your ears won't become uncomfortable warm during use. These headphones are very comfortable.As far as specs, you can get a good assessment of the product from reading the Amazon description so I won't go into that.For portable devices with a headphone jack, you simply have to purchase a ""2-RCA (female) to headphone jack (male 3.5mm plug) adapter"". Make sure the adapter is a ""stereo"" adapter versus a ""mono"" adapter. They look exactly the same, so beware. These adapters are pretty inexpensive.I was a little concerned about getting wireless headphones because of all the negative reviews I've read regarding sound quality, interference, etc.Sound quality and hissing can be minimized if you set up properly. Here's a quick ""What to do"":Portable Players (i.e. CD, MP3, Walkman, etc):1) If the device comes with an output other than the headphone jack, use it. This other output (line-out) is usually a jack that delivers a constant, high (i.e. loud) signal. Regardless of your headphone volume level, this jack will output at a constant, strong, loud signal. These line-out jacks are usually found on the back of some CD players.2) If the device only comes with a headphone jack, set the volume to max or near max. This is the setup I'm using. These headphones were bought primarily to be use at work, so I can listen to my iPod wirelessly.NOTE!!! If you're connected to a dedicated home amp/receivers/etc... DO NOT crank the volume all the way up or even remotely close to it. (The line out on your home amp/receiver will transmit a strong, clear signal regardless of the volume setting, if you're connected to the receiver/amp's line-out)The volume should be set high ONLY for smaller, portable devices that output less power such as an MP3 player or handheld portable CD player. You've been warned;-)Why set the signal coming from your unit as high as possible? It significantly reduces the background noise, since the signal being transmitted is strong. You won't need to turn up the volume on your headset as high since the signal being transmitted is strong. Yes, your portable music player will use up power faster, but who cares? Use a power adapter for your device.If your signal wasn't strong, you would need to increase the headset volume which also increases the level of background hiss. Try it out. I would speculate that a lot of these reviews, which complain of unbearable hissing, are a result of their device's volume level being set low.Hope this info helps. Enjoy the headphones... They're pretty nice. ANSWERNOTFOUND",These headphones work great,"(0, 27)"

I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a tad big for my hands, which might just be a little smaller than average - but it always seemed to me it is harder for those with larger hands to find mice, so that's probably a good feature. It is still a big improvement! It has nice grip on the thumb side and a nice-feeling semi-rubberized right side (which I wish were a little more grippy). The scroll wheel has a very nice feel and grip. The nano receiver fits into the bottom fairly firmly. Completely plug and play on my MacOS10.8 setup. Tracks and slides nicely, feels quality all over.

B003ZSHNGS,good,How good is photo quality?,"This camera is fantastic. I own the Panasonic GF-1, GX-1, LX7 and will continue to use them, however the S95 has proven over and over to be a fantastic pocket sized competitor, even outshining it's 'upgrade' S100 as THE go to camera. Even what would be considered generations past its release date, the S95 continues to show that Canon has made a solid impact on the point and shoot division by showing that it's not only DSLR's that can take stunning photos.I have purchased this camera for my girlfriend, both my sisters own the S95, and we are going to purchase yet another S95 for my mom, who loves taking photos but has an old and again Cybershot.The camera takes extremely sharp photos, works well in low-lighting conditions (with a steady hand of course), has brilliant color reproduction and some of the best video I've seen from a point and shoot. Sometimes it takes better photos than my own cameras, despite the huge price difference. For anyone looking for a compact, high quality camera, get this.

B005DKZTMG,full,Is it a wireless keyboard?,"Edit: After being completely disgusted about the right shift key location, I searched for key-remapping options.  SharpKeys is a quick-and-easy solution for Windoze 2000/XP/7/8.  Make sure you download it from the author's website as the first two installers I downloaded (from sites I had considered trustworthy) were full of bloatware.  Once installed, I swapped the mapping of the up-arrow and right shift keys on my K400 and wow what a difference.  I'm actually pretty happy with this keyboard after this fix.  I would increase the rating to 4 stars, but the credit goes to randyrants_dot_com for the software, not Logitech.  The only downside with this fix is that it swaps the keys in the OS, so if you plug in another keyboard the up-arrow and right shift will be swapped on that too.  And if you VNC or Remote Desktop you will likely experience the same problem there.The only unfortunate thing with this finding is that there are so many reviews of this keyboard it's not likely that many existing owners will see this fix.Original Review:The K400 is a decent wireless keyboard.  The layout is pretty good given the small format.  The tactile feedback is good.  The battery life, so far, has been pretty good.  I've only had the keyboard for 2 months but just discovered the on/off switch, so I'm fairly impressed the battery has lasted this long (although it may also have an auto-off power save feature).  The range is just okay.  The spec indicates > 30', but my couch is just 10' from my PC in my media center and if I'm reclined or have my legs up a bit it tends to block the transmission.  If I have the media cabinet door closed the range is only a few feet at best.Despite these few short comings, this would be a nearly 5-star product save the one fatal flaw -- the location of the right shift key.  If you look at the right shift key on any well-used keyboard you'll generally see a shiny spot on the left side - where most people strike the key.  Logitech, a company which typically puts out some good, smart products, blew this one.  They put the up-arrow key in this location, making a skinny little shift key to the left of the up-arrow.  After two months of use I still up-arrow virtually every time I try to use the left shift key.  It drives me nuts and and is the reason for the 2-star review.  I have no earthly idea what they were thinking, I can only assume they never actually tested it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",After being completely disgusted about,"(6, 44)"

B000HJPK2C,accurate,Is the focus of the binoculars simple and accurate?,"I own and have used the lens for over 3 months now. I have experienced some softness out beyond 200mm while using it on auto-focus, but I am learning to work within the limits of the lens. Given what has been said in some reviews about softness out past 200mm (and my own initial experience) I decided to run some tests for how sharp the pictures could really be. The one caveat I had is that for the tests I ran I used manual focus - I wanted to test the optics not the AF or VR functions since they are not a requirement for using the lens. Also, I am starting to get very interested in Equestrian photography. I need the long zoom and have found that pre-focusing on a point, rather than depending on Auto-focus is much more effective for obtaining the results I am looking for.For my test I used this lens mounted on a D300 to take some pictures of a bell tower. Because I was specifically testing the lens for sharpness past 200mm (I shot several at 300mm) I focused the lens manually, and used a tripod. As it turned out there was chain link fencing over the opening to the bell which I could not see, from where I was standing in a parking lot across the street. That made my test even better.I then took several shots of the bell and the tower, being careful to focus the lens on specific characteristics of the bell. The shots were all sharp. I then downloaded and examined the photos at high magnification on my PC. I did not lose any significant resolution of the chain link (which I could only make out after I downloaded the pictures) or the objects I was focused upon until I viewing the shots at 200% or greater magnification. At that point you could actually begin to see the individual pixels. So I have to say that I do not agree with the reviews about how the lens gives poor results out past 200mm. I have obtained excellent results through the entire zoom range.I will say that the AF-S system for the lens seems to hunt a lot when there are a lot of objects in the field of view (i.e., the leaves on a tree while trying to photograph a bird), so it does sometimes focus on something other that what I want - that could have been what the others were complaining about. But if I assure myself that it is focused on my target and use the AF lock built into the camera that problem goes away. Also if I use the lens on manual focus the problem goes away.I am very happy with the lens and highly recommend it. I believe it is an outstanding value for the price. ANSWERNOTFOUND",focus is much more effective for obtaining the results,"(709, 763)"
B009PK9S90,light,Is this camera slightly small?,"UPDATE ON FEB. 9, 2013BATTERY LIFE:  The battery of the Hero2 does last 2x longer than the battery life of the Hero3.  I confirmed this as I did some videoing during the blizzard.  I bought the Wasabi battery pack with charger and their 1200mAh batteries do out last the stock batteries of 1050mAh.  But it won't  add significant life and you cannot swap the battery out with the GoPro Battery BacPac.  So I recommend buying more batteries and having at least 1 battery BacPac.END OF UPDATEThis is a review of the GoPro Hero3 Black Edition.  I am not going to explain what 1080i/30fps mean or any other specifics.  You should already know that since you are looking at this camera.  This is not the forum for technical explanations of what 4.7 Cin means for example.With that said, when I received the Hero3 the first thing I did was fully charge it.  I then went to preform a firmware update.  This was not needed as my camera came up-to-date.  I am running Windows 7.  I have shot pictures and video with it and it lives up to its expectation.Battery Life:  The battery life is short.  More so with the wifi on and/or LCD attached.  (I also bought the battery bacpac and the LCD Touch Screen).  I believe the problem of battery life to be the battery itself.  I own a Hero2 also.  The Hero2 uses an 1100mAh.  The Hero3 uses a 1050mAh.  It doesn't seem like much but I think the -50mAh is what hurts the Hero3.  I also ordered extra batteries from Wasabi.  I believe that these batteries will help this issue as they are 1200mAh.  These have not arrived.  When they do I will post some test results.  I plan on testing all the batteries alone and in conjunction with the battery bacpac.Freezing up:  I have had both my Hero2 (with the new update) and Hero3 freeze on me.  This only happened 1x each and it was when I was trying to rush through the menus. Since then, I have not had any freezing up issues.The screen:  I see people complaining about the little black and grey screen.  It's fine.  You are not buying this camera for fancy screen.  If you want a fancy screen; buy something different or get the touch screen.  The touch screen does improve moving through the menus immensely.  This camera is small so that it can be used in extreme situations without being cumbersome. It's smaller size and weight reductions is incredible.  I hardly notice it when using the head strap.Why I gave this a 4 star rating .... The camera functions as it was promised.  I am a little disappointed that they went to a lesser battery.  Meaning from a 1100mAh to a 1050mAh.  I am also upset with the fact that for all products I have to print out the manuals.  when spending $400 ... I expect the manuals.  Lastly, no covers.  If you want covers for the camera itself and the housing, you have to purchase them separately.  with those few list inconveniences; it was enough for me to take away 1 star.Few last words: DO NOT BY THIS CAMERA FROM GOPRO ... Their customer service SUCKS!!!  Good luck getting anything from them aside of long waits on the phone.  I purchased mine thought Amazon.I hope this helped.

B0074BW614,amazing,How does the device work?,"I got this for Christmas and loved it immediately.  I waited to review it, because glitches and problems generally show up after the excitement has worn off.  I've had a couple of thoughts of ""I wish,"" but nothing that would make me lower my rating.  Here's what I like--and what I don't:This screen is absolutely beautiful.  I wanted it mostly for books, but videos and content are flawless on it.  The books are beautiful and crisp, too, with plenty of options to change brightness and color.  This cuts down on eye strain.  There is a glare, in bright sun.  This is worse than a regular kindle, but not as bad as most tablets.  I was expecting much worse, with the HD screen, so I've just put it down as the best possible at this time.I wanted this because I'm in college and constantly needing books.  It's faster, easier, and cheaper to download kindle books than to try to buy them in a physical copy, especially when I need  some of the more obscure titles for my classes.  I still have books that I want for myself in hardback form, but nothing beats kindle for college!The build is sturdy, but light.  I don't feel like I'm going to break it if I touch it, but it's comfortable to hold.A lot of people complain about not being able to get Google play content and try to find workarounds, but I don't need that, so it's not an issue for me.  I'd rather buy from Amazon, anyway.  Past experience has taught me that their customer service and quality is superior.  If you aren't like me and you want to be able to access absolutely everything in the world on one device, it might be a drawback.  For me, it's not a problem.  I haven't come across anything I need that Amazon doesn't offer--usually cheaper and/or better then the other guys.I am not very techno-savvy, so it's a plus for me that this device is easy and ready to use right out of the box.  I signed in to Amazon and had everything I've bought in the past at my fingertips.One MINOR drawback is the memory.  You'd think 16gb was enough, but it's only enough if you keep your content in the cloud.  That's fine, if you aren't traveling, but if you find yourself without wifi access you cannot get to your content.  I downloaded a season of a tv show, knowing I would be without wifi, and it really ate up the memory, slowing my kindle fire down a lot.  After watching, I removed the episodes from the device and the slowdown disappeared.  I found myself wishing for more memory, then.  Most of the time, though, I rely on the cloud and 16gb is fine.  I just have to remember that small limitation.  (If I were buying one, I'd go with the 32gb model, personally, and have a little more room to download content for the times I'll be without access.  This was a gift, so I cannot really complain.)  I love the cloud and use it for most things, anyway, so it's a minor issue.  The only time memory is a problem is when I'm traveling.  For some, that might be a bigger issue than it is for me, as it's a portable device.  On my daughter's tablet, which has expandable memory, we are able to download a lot more content and take it with us.  Entertainment is never out of reach, even without internet.  All in all, though, my kindle is easier to work, has a better screen, and is organized better.  Everything has drawbacks.I haven't found anything in the three weeks I've had my kindle fire that would make it anything less than a great value.  I definitely recommend this device.  It has been very helpful and entertaining. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this device is easy and ready,"(1801, 1830)"

I plan to get my Dad one (and set it up for him) due to its simplicity he will love it.I read the numerous warnings about battery swell.  Did some research into lithium ion batteries and found out heat and over charging are the culprits.  So never leave it on charger for long periods and do not charge every day.  I toss it on there for one or two hours every few days.  Other interesting points about his type of battery: You should not let it go completely uncharged, ever.  If going to store it for a prolonged period try to get it around 40% to 50% charged before storing.  No need to worry about letting it lose most or all of it's charge before recharging, that applies to ni-cad batteries. Replacement batteries are all over the internet ranging from $6 to $20, so I plan to check monthly and pick up a new one at any sign of swelling, although I bet overcharging is the main reason most people get swollen battery.

B0074BW614,big,Do you have a big problem?,I've owned 4 Kindles so far and they all perform very well.  The one major drawback is the power cord connection.  It is not durable at all and you have to be very careful not to move the Kindle while it's plugged in. I had to replace 3 Kindles in the last 2 years and thankfully it was under warranty.

B002ZIMEMW,thin,How is the quality of the material?,"Even though this reflector is not that expensive, it does the job greatly.I normally use it when shooting outdoors to avoid having weird shades. The Translucent/Silver/Gold/White/Black side does an excellent job :)I'll recommend you to buy it, the size is great, the materials look durable (have had an issue yet and I bought a while ago), it feels sturdy yet it is easy to collapse (if you have practice on folding this type of reflectors), comes with a carry bag, when collapse doesn't take much space so it's easy to transport.Definitely a really good purchase.Recommended product.

B0038W0K2K,not bad,How is the sound quality of this one?,"I'm very pleased so far. First, these earphones finally do stay in my ears during a workout, unlike any other earphone I have tried so far. They are comfortable and easy to adjust. They also come with  a semi-hard case that protects them in my gym bag.The sound quality is more than acceptable for the price point and, after a few uses, the sound seems to be improving (break-in effect?).

B0038W0K2K,heavy,How is the bass?,"I have two points to make for the sake of full disclosure before actually writing a review of these headphones. First off, I received a free pair of the M6P headphones in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I will do my best to deliver on my end of the bargain, with a review written for those wondering if they should spend their hard-earned money on the M6P. Secondly, I have never been an in-ear headphone person. I've used plenty of in-ear headphones in my day, but I have always preferred over-ear headsets as I find them to be, nine out of ten times, much more comfortable and high quality in their sound. That been said, I have been massively impressed by these headphones so far. Let's get to it then, shall we?As with any headphones, primary concern for me is sound. How does the M6P fare in that regard? Surprisingly well. I have never owned a pair of in-ear headphones that has had such a good sound range as these do. Usually, this sort of headset is severely lacking in bass and lower-mid tones, but the M6P has a genuinely fantastic range. Of course, the bass isn't quite what you'd get with over-ear phones, but honestly, it sounds pretty great. A little adjustment to equalization settings is all it takes for it to sound the way I like. Highs, mids, and lows are all  distinct and clear, with no one aspect overpowering the others. I've really enjoyed my time with the M6P so far. They also look pretty cool. I got the ""clear"" option, and it's got a nice clean science fiction look to it. I like it.The M6P has several features that are worth noting as well. The last three or so inches of cords that go into the headphones themselves are made of a much stiffer material than the rest of the cord is. This ""memory wire"" is there is so you can mold them around your ear, making these headphones perfect to use while exercising or working. I have a physical job that allows me to listen to music while working, and these headphones have been incredibly nice for that. They rarely jostle or fall out. If you're looking for a good set of headphones for use while working out, these are ones I'd give serious consideration. The M6P also has an inline universal control that has a surprisingly large variety of uses for only having a single button, a volume slider, and a built-in microphone. The volume slider is incredibly nice as you don't have to fight to get your iPod/Mp3 player out of your pocket to adjust the volume. Same goes for the single button, which can be use for playing/pausing music and even skipping or restarting tracks depending on how you press it. The mic works pretty well for phone calls too. Overall, the inline universal control is a pretty convenient feature I rather appreciated. It's a pretty high-end feature that I've never had on any in-ear headphones before.The M6P comes in an attractive little box with plenty of accessories in addition to the headphones themselves. There's a really small zip-up case that carries other things in addition to the headphones. There's a really nice folded up users manual that is very helpful in getting acquainted with the product and its various features. There's also a small zip-lock baggy with several different types of rubbery ear tips you can switch out if the default ear-tips don't suit your fancy. I really appreciated the extra ear-tips, as each of the six pairs pretty much guarantees that, no matter what your ears are shaped like, you will be able to enjoy these headphones comfortably. That's great. There's also a little clip that can be used to attach the phones into your shirt or whatever, which is a nice feature that helps keep the pressure off your ears if the cord gets tugged a bit. Overall, a nice package.Truly, these are great headphones, but they're not without some quirks to consider. The memory wire, as great as it is for keeping the phones in your ears, makes it so the headphones take longer to put in than others would be. Once you put the earbuds in your ears, you'll want to make sure you won't need to take them out for a little while. I also found the memory wire a pain to struggle with right out of the box until they had broken in. The memory wire on the right-earbud on mine were particularly stubborn for a little while. Once broken in, however, the memory wire is very easy to make conform to your ears and wroks great. Finally, and this is admittedly a nitpicky gripe, I don't care for the plug-in jack myself. It is angled at 90', with an L-shape. I prefer straight plug-ins for headphones, but that's just my preference, and doesn't really take the quality of the phones down at all. None of these are issues that would keep me away from the M6P, mind you, but they are quirks to keep in mind.All things considered, these are fantastic headphones. I've been supremely surprised by their high quality in comparison to all the other in-ear headphones I've owned. I have friends with high-end in-ear headsets that were twice the price (or higher) as these, but in my opinion, the M6P is much higher quality in terms of sound and has a much more robust feature set. These are a pretty awesome deal at $40! It appears you can get them for even cheaper than that on Amazon too, which astounds me. I'd definitely give these a hearty recommendation at this price. They're a great set of headphones. I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading. Toodles. ANSWERNOTFOUND",bass lower,"(991, 1005)"
B002SZEOLG,wireless,How is connection?,"My son's older Toshiba laptop was refusing to connect to our home wireless network.  Despite our best efforts with troubleshooting, the only way he was able to get online to do homework, etc. was by a wired connection.When the TP-LINK arrived, he took a few minutes to set it up and he now has wireless access again.  It was very easy to set up, even with our moderate-to-high secured wireless network (which has been known to cause problems for guests).  The day after he used it, it seemed to ""forget"" everything and he had to do the entire setup again but after that it's been smooth sailing.

B00DVFLJDS,better,How does it compare to the other display?,"Being my first tablet (I do not even use a smartphone) and a lifelong user of desktop computers, I was expecting a limited, clunky, and slow device. I was wrong, the tablet worked right out of the box without issues. WiFi only required the router password before connecting for the first time.  The performance is great, it has plenty of storage, the touch screen is very responsive, the interface is very easy to learn, and the image / text quality is superb. Battery life is great, even with WiFi, Bluetooth, and apps running.  I already tested the Bluetooth and USB connectivity (using an OTG adapter) with some industrial sensors and it works great. The tablet is highly configurable and extendable through custom apps.The Google play store has most if not all the apps you will ever want, and if it does not have it, you can write your own with several free developing environments available for android.I was looking at a comparable Windows 8 tablet but the Nexus is made for a touch interface and has a much more robust and mature environment for a portable device.

B003VANOI6,handy,How is the remote?,"My husband, long a Bose devotee, was really impressed with the sound this small system delivers.  Especially as an unadjustable portable speaker system.  My iPhone 3GS fits in the dock even wearing a slim design shell case.  The remote seems to have good range and provides the delightful experience of being able to remotely control my mp3 player with no issues from distances of up to about 15 feet.  The remote is tiny and would be really easy to lose.As this system has on-board rechargeable batteries it is a simple matter of unplugging it to take with you and plugging it in again at your destination.  Battery life claims to be as high as 8 hours though we've never gotten close to that.  We did use it for an extended afternoon one day while we cleaned out the garage and it seemed to have plenty of juice left at the end of the day.  While Logitech really delivered with this system, it can not be all things to all people.It is not really ""portable"" in the modern sense of the world.  Yes, you can unplug it and it will play in your car, on your desk, etc... but it is not an old fashioned ""boom box"".  It's not meant to be moved around while in operation.  The carry sack is just that:  a custom fitted sack or sleeve.  It does not provide significant padding to protect the device from bumps and short drops - nor does it have a strap with which to carry the console.

B008ABOJKS,outstanding,How do you like the performance?,"asuswrt is by far the best firmware for this router right now, unfortunately.  I say unfortunately because it lacks the features and customization I've grown to love from tomato (shibby in particular) and dd-wrt.  That said, the performance is excellent and I recommend this over it's n66u cousin.  One of the (two) wireless interfaces on this is a newer broadcom chip with more features that the twin interfaces on the n66u, so even if you don't use ac (yet), you still have a better chip at your disposal.  Unfortunately, going back to the firmware problem, you can't squeeze or customize much out of the new chip with the current firmware and lack of third party offerings, which you currently can with the n66u.just for example, the default tx power, as listed by wl, is 1500 (!) mw (using the latest asuswrt firmware).  That is about 1480 more than I'd like.  Thanks to a user named Merlin, we can download a modified version of asuswrt and customize settings beyond the webinterface, and in using it, I can set the power properly, as well as a bunch of other features (iptables droplists, upnpd custom settings, dnsmasq custom settings, hosts file, cron jobs, and more).  Even by setting the txpower to a sane setting through the webinterface, BTW, it still defaults to 1500 (or 1496ish) for some mysterious reason.  Atleast as reported by wl (the main configuration and settings program published by Broadcom).As for performance, I am very pleased.  I can break 300Mbps using an tri band N adapter w/o problem.  Also pleased with the stability.  Just wish shibby could implement the key features (speed speed speed) of asuswrt firmware into his code so I can use some of those terrific features and bypass the hideous default/stock webinterface.In short, this is a terrific router for the coming years.  At the moment however, the n66u with tomato shibby firmware is probably better.  That said, I don't regret paying the price to be forward compatible.  I'm lacking a few features I'd like to implement but the performance (speed) has been terrific and stable.

B003VAHYTG,beautiful,How is the sound?,"These speakers are great! they are not the prettiest looking speakers, but the quality of the sound, even at high volumes, is great.

B0030MITDK,small,How good is the battery?,"This will be a ramble - I am generally well satisfied with this product but there are a few things to be aware of.  Firstly, I purchased the product as a refurbished unit and only paid $75 including shipping - I added two additional batteries quite inexpensively through eBay.It is easily portable and seems to have fairly good battery time - here's a sample of 720 P quality - not bad.  [...]I suspect that this is a generic criticism as the small microphones embedded in this type of a video recorder has no resistance to wind.  What you can expect is that if you are moving and experience when passing across the microphone you will get wind noise.My original intention was to use this video camera on my bicycle and to that end, I constructed a helmet cam mount.  This would probably work but I found that the additional weight on top of my helmet was unacceptable - the camera weighs 4.4 ounces - seemingly trivial but noticeable on top of your head.  At five megapixels, the still picture capability is adequate but nothing special.  I chose to get a ZX3 as opposed to the newer ZX5 - there were several reasons for this choice:The ZX3 has removable batteries, the five does not.  The charge coupled device is larger on the ZX three and quite a few sophisticated reviewers felt that the ZX five was a downgrade in some respects.  And then there was the issue of a dramatically lower price.Summarizing, this camera is good enough and portable enough that I will often carry the camera in situations where I would have been lugging my Canon T1 I.  Go for it! ANSWERNOTFOUND",good battery,"(323, 335)"

I have a long history using Canon P&S; and this one is the best ever. I wansn't totally happy with other Canon P&S;, having tried most of them. The control ring around the lens make this camera a step above all of its competitors. Depend on the mode you are in (Av, Tv..), the ring functions differently. For example, if you are in aperture priority (Av), turn the ring will change the f-stops. So in Tv, the ring will change your shutter speed. And then you can reprogram it to change something else if you wish. Image quality is superb. No noise or any bluring even at actual-pixel level. Astoundingly sharp with sufficient light and way above average low light performance. And just imaging you can put all this in your pocket!Now, Amazon customer service. I purchased this camera 2 weeks ago *on Amazon* for $429. Today it is $406 *on Amazon*. If I want my $23 credit, I have to return the camera and order a new one.

B005KJJKVG,good,How was your ear?,"The rise, domination, and nearly complete takeover of recorded music by the MP3 and its relatives has had a curious effect on a lot of people. To some who have made listening to music a part of their lives for the better part of their lives, it usually does not take long at all for one truth to become glaringly and disturbingly apparent: no longer could the music speak for itself. The mandates of the compression algorithms now dictate what we hear.I don't want to raise the spectre of arguments like this long passed- the cassette tape, the CD- for that matter, people were probably bitching about the change from shellac to vinyl.But one fact remains unalterable: MP3's mess with the music. And using them in evaluating any sound reproduction device, i.e. speakers, headphones, earbuds, strikes me as not dissimilar from using Applebee's food to evaluate cutlery.This is by no means intended to be a slam at Applebees, but the point for which I strive is how can you tell if you are dining on the best when what you are eating is a faulty reproduction of the real thing?Having cleared the air with that, I can move on to say that MP3's have forced even the most casual but dedicated music appreciator into the same niche as the true audiophile- suddenly, it makes a difference.So then how to judge and review? Where is the benchmark? I would split with a broadaxe the subject into two categories: did it come with a 1/8"" mini-plug, or a true "" audio connector?As these cans came with the former, we must assume that they were primarily intended for the MP3 and portable music crowd in general. The slick foldability of the design furthers this theory. The aforementioned plug is of a slim design, clearly intended to fit into any device with any shell.It is also angled at a 45, the first time I have seen this and at once settling the argument of straight up or 90.That they are Bose insures two things: the sound quality promises that they will be superior, and that they are probably overpriced.In back to back tests with a particular favorite album using my new benchmark Sennheiser cans, the Bose did OK- I noticed they seem to deliver more volume at a lower setting from the playback device, in this case an iPod Classic.While the sound was clear and relatively distinct, I would say that's about it. The bass response was adequate, nothing special. After the truly sensual experience of the over the ear Sennheisers, going back to an on-ear device such as this is a letdown.But there can be no argument that the quality is superb, the ""knockdown"" and storage of these phones is very nicely executed,although it does seem that they would not take well to rough handling. So, unlike others I have seen, they come with a semi-rigid case that's roughly (and ironically) the size of a CD, and well built to stand the rigors of travel. To test this theory I may pass them along to my flight attendant sister for the analysis of a true road- or sky warrior.All in all, there are too many choices, and yours will probably be determined in part by reviews such as this, what your friends say, and ultimately what brand you choose to advertise on your head. You can do worse than the Bose for the same price, but I believe with more diligent study you might also do better. ANSWERNOTFOUND",#NAME?,"(2448, 2464)"
B002R5AM7C,better,How is the image of the company?,"Flip has outdone themselves with this iteration of the Mino! Opening the box gives a really good indicator of how the device is going to look...sleek glossy black face with a nice aluminum case! I pulled the MinoHD out, turned it on, and was shooting HD video 30 seconds later.  There's some setup you can choose to do, like adding the date info, etc - it all takes seconds and then you're done.I initially shot about 10 mins of video and then plugged it in to my MacBook Pro running Snow Leopard.  It immediately mounted on the desktop, Flip software launched, and the video was sitting there ready for viewing and sharing.  There wasn't a single second of setup time on the computer... not even my iPhone can get video done this well and this quickly.  In fact, I've been carrying the MinoHD pretty much everywhere now - it's just a better video experience, period.The Flip software is really very good and it worked just as well on a Windows 7 machine as it did on my Mac at home. The camera itself is built extremely well, and Flip added nice touches that most manufacturers don't think matter.  Great example: When recording video the aluminum glows red around the glass and lens to let people know the camera is on. They could have just put a red LED somewhere on it, but they really went the extra distance and designed that kind of stuff IN to the case.The USB connector is really solid, too. It folds back in to the case, and a tiny switch flips it out when needed.  This is also how it charges! No issues getting the battery to full from my laptop's USB port in a short amount of time, and the longevity is fantastic.The video is really, really good.  It easily blows away the iPhone 3GS (but NOT the iPhone 4), and looks nearly as good as the HD video recorded by my Canon T1i DSLR.  When viewed via HDMI on a 55"" Samsung LED, the video is just awesome. Very clear even in lower light conditions! The mic is decent... not the best ever, but it gets the jobs done.  For the cost of this camera, it's build quality, video & audio quality, and ease of use - this is an EASY 5-star review.  Great, great work Flip!

B004E10KFG,not bad,Where is the speaker agent?,"There are many times when I just want my background music to follow me to the patio, on the road, in the kitchen, at meetings -- even at the beach. We used to cart around jam boxes with mix tapes, but now our computers, smart phones, tablets and just about any internet connected device can access our online music library. The speakers on these devices are just horrible and sometimes, I don't want to have headphones on. I wanted a nice sounding small unit that would allow me to enjoy music anywhere from just about any device.The JAMBOX is small, easy to use, sounds very good for background music, is an excellent design and even runs on batteries.SIZE: this thing is very small, you can take it anywhere and tuck it away in a place where it almost disappears. All you get is music.DESIGN: These folks included a simple interface that uses only four buttons and voice feedback to tell you how to pair a device, charging status and much more. It comes with a manual, but honestly, you can set this up with no trouble out of the box. It is well constructed with a nice feel. It even looks good.BLUETOOTH CALLING: The bluetooth implementation works for sound and as a speakerphone. I was not purchasing this as a speakerphone but WOW, this things is great for conferencing as long as everyone is in front of it. Yes it has an integrated microphone. Rejection is very good, we could all clearly hear the caller and they could hear us as well.SOUND: The sound is actually very good for background music. You won't get big stereo sound field, excellent imaging, thumping bass or dance party volume levels -- but what you do get is actually quite impressive. The sound is balanced from top to bottom and is actually very natural. Acoustic music with vocals like James Taylor, Nora Jones or Shane Jackman are reproduced with excellent balance and clarity. Electronic pop music can lack the dynamics and extended bass, but the bass you do get is not boomy and sounds very natural. One more thing about the bass, it is actually amazing this little thing puts out as much bass as it does for the size. If you are worried the JAMBOX will not play loud, it will, just not THUMPING loud. Because of the smooth high end and good tonal response, you can listen to this thing for a long time with almost no fatigue.BLUETOOTH MUSIC: As most devices, the BlueTooth audio is not as good as if you use the 1/8 audio jack. If you want the best sound plug your phone or computer into this thing. It will amaze you. You may need to turn your headphone output down some so as not to overdrive the unit. It will get a little distorted. The BlueTooth sound is very good, just not as good as when using the plug. Jawbone does something very interesting with the BlueTooth audio. Some devices with BlueTooth audio can be overdriven with the audio output from the source and will distort in at the higher levels. I play guitar and some distortion is good, but not on prerecorded music. NO! The folks at JamBox know then and use something called compression to dynamically limit the amount of sound from your device to the JAMBOX when your BlueTooth level is to high. This compression can sound like 70's pop radio where all the dynamics form the music are taken out. if this bothers you, turn your device (phone/iPod/computer) BlueTooth volume down until the compression is eliminated then use the volume on the JAMBOX to adjust the sound. BUGE IMPROVEMENT.In summary, of the BT Speakers out, this one is the best value for me. Smaller than the Bose, sounds about as good, super easy to use and has MUCH better sound than the sub $100 solutions. If Steve Jobs were to design a BlueTooth portable music device, it would look like the JAMBOX. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The speakers on these devices are just horrible and sometimes,"(324, 385)"
B002HWRJBM,internal,How is battery?,"This is by far the best mouse I've owned. Stylish and precise, feels great in the hand as well. The one thing I have to complain about is battery life. I use this on a daily basis at work and I find myself having to recharge it once a week. It's not a huge complaints because the included battery is rechargable and you can recharge by plugging a USB cable, but most other wireless mice has a considerably longer battery life. That's the only reason I'm giving this a 4 instead of 5 stars.Also, the scroll wheel had a feature that wasn't obvious to me at first when I looked at the product online: there is a small button next to the scroll wheel which switches between normal scrolling found in other mice (where you hear a grinding noise as you scroll) and a smooth super-fast scrolling (with this, if you spin the scroll wheel fast, it just keeps scrolling freely on its own for a good couple of seconds before it stops!)

B0053DDNW6,full,Is a good quality of memory ?,"I bought this from Amazing Tech Depot. It's one of the few times I received something like this in a ziploc bag (with the DVR in a bubble wrap). Construction is cheap, and although the instructions described an A/V cable, there isn't one in the package. I wasn't planning on connecting this directly to a TV, so I didn't follow up on that.What's included is the DVR, the lithium ion battery, the suction cup mount, a piece of instruction leaflet (English, Chinese and Russian), the car power adapter (very long cord - can be routed to keep it out of the way) and a mini USB cable. You need to open one of the flaps on the side to plug in the USB power cable. The other flap on the opposite side covers the SD card slot.The screen is protected by a sheet of plastic. Removing it was a pain, but take your time so that you don't damage the LCD. The LCD is useful for helping aim the camera, and for settings, but unusable in bright sunlight even inside the car. I went through the menu settings. They're pretty much self explanatory, which is good because the instruction leaflet was no help. You need to supply a full sized SD card. I used a 32 GB card without any problem.There is a 1920x1080 setting for video. When I chose that, it recorded in 1280x720 (NOT 1080p), but at slightly above 30 fps. At the 1280x720 setting, it recorded at just slightly above 29.97 fps.Encoding format is motion JPEG. Video quality is mediocre. Don't count on being able to read license plates, but you can definitely tell what you're seeing. IR, as most people pointed out, is useless, and you can leave it off.Using it is simple. Leave it plugged in. When the car turns on, it powers up the unit which starts recording. When you turn the car off, the unit records for another few seconds, then powers off. Files are 2 mins in length, configurable for longer lengths. Default is to erase older files when the card is full.At just a bit over $20, it's a good DVR to play around with. Probably good enough for insurance purposes, though I'm not sure if it can be used as evidence in court. My guess is that it would probably be good enough to prove your innocence (or at least cast reasonable doubt), but not enough to get someone else convicted. At this price, it is cheap enough to try out, and buy a better unit if you decide this is something you'd like to have. ANSWERNOTFOUND",erase older files when the card is full,"(1865, 1904)"
B006ZP8UOW,fine,How is the resolution?,"Easy to set up.  Easy to use.  Easy to access from my computer or my android phone.We're using for our nursery to keep an eye on our little one.

B0027VT6V4,enough,How is the volume of the unit?,"These speakers ROCK. I've tried Cyber Acoustic products against Logitech and Altec Lansing, and these speakers are by far the best in their category.Firstly, the satellite tower design includes two speakers per tower, which helps distribute sound over a greater area than with single speaker designs. This greatly improves the listening experience, as the ""sweet spot"" area has widened so listeners perceive full-sounding stereo from a variety of locations in a small room. Additionally this avoids the pitfalls of ""small"" computer speakers which sound small, like music playing from a tin box. (the CA speakers 1 level below these with a single speaker design by comparison sound MUCH worse).Secondly, the bass and speakers are very powerful for their size, and have little to no distortion even at full-volume.The sub-woofer volume is adjustable independently of the other speakers. This lets you boost bass for music genres with a lot of low-frequency sounds, such as electronic/dance or hip-hop/rap, and likewise decrease bass for genres like classical and acoustic where the bass could overwhelm the instruments or vocals.The cord is conveniently long ans contains a circular volume control with a headphone jack and aux input.NOTE: I have two of these speaker systems because a roommate dropped a satellite speaker and broke the plastic foot. They are plenty sturdy if you respect them and should last a long time if handle them carefully. I guess that also shows how good these speakers are, that they broke and I bought them again.I'm a recording enthusiast, and these speakers satisfy my needs. They are not studio monitors but it's definitely possible to create good mixes on them. They take up considerably less space than professional studio monitors and are hundreds of dollars cheaper, but the sound quality is not significantly worse than monitors I've tried. They are easily 10x better than integrated speakers in TVs, laptops, etc. and they are a few steps above every speaker set in the less than $70 price range.

The best part is, you don't need to put it under direct light to re-charge the batteries, if you have some sort of light source near to the keyboard, that's all it needs. I don't know about this product on the long term, it's been only one month since I bought it, but it has been working well so far.

It was going well, until it melted down (known problem).  I removed the hard disk and we used it as a router only, with less overheating.  That lasted a few weeks until I started hearing panicked hollers from all corners of our condo.  Sure enough, it was time to replace our router.We wound up with the TP-LINK WDR3500.Set up was very easy, using the web browser based interface.We were back up and surfing on all of our devices in around 30 minutes from the arrival of the box until I entered the last password into the last iDevice.Not too bad.  I did set up two different networks though, so the folks who are playing can use one band and the other is used by me.So far everything has been great.  I did have to go through setup once again, after a power outage, but it was even faster than the initial set up, due to familiarity on my part.Right now we have two tablets, an ipod touch, an ailing and ancient macbook, a macmini, an XO/OLPC laptop (linux), a smartphone, and our vonage service all connecting through the TP-LINK TL-WDR3500 without any hiccups.  For the first time in years, I have a reliable wireless connection to my other computer (perfect for when it's monitor croaked) and it has been almost 2 months and my mom hasn't complained about the sound quality when she calls us and it was always an issue (for her) when our vonage box and phones were routed through the Time Capsule.There is only one USB port.  That's not an issue for us.  I did have some trouble getting my Seagate Slim drive to connect and function as a network drive, but because the connection is so seamless and reliable, I have my Labelwriter printer connected to the USB port and I hooked up a larger USB hub to the macmini which I then connected to the router.  That way I can still access everything, but it also gives me an extra layer of protection as the router requires one password and the computer another.I was upset when our Time Capsule petered out, but this router made the transition a positive one and I think I'm done with Time Capsule, but I'd recommend this to friends and family without hesitation.

B006OBGEHW,great,How is the leather?,"The MoKo Slim-Fit Genuine LeatherA Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7Before I give my reasons why, let me note this case comes with no instructions, like so many products. Some folks have been confused just putting their Nexus 7 into this case (even breaking things!)So let's clarify that:The Front CoverThe outside of the front cover has the Nexus logo. The inside of the front cover has a strap 1 inch wide for your hand, two deep grooves, and a thin elastic black strap.The Back CoverThe outside of the back cover has a shallow fold-line. While the back cover is delivered flat, it is designed to be folded, well,  at the fold-line! (Don't bend the front cover!) But do go ahead and fold the Back Cover back at the fold-line. This fold turns the back cover into a support when you use the Nexus 7 in this case in the horizontal Landscape orientation.The inside of the back cover has six padded fingers. Two of those fingers are off by themselves. The other Four are clustered together. You (a) slightly fold the back cover, (b) then slide your Nexus 7 into those four fingers - exactly like sliding a drawer back into furniture. When all the way into the four fingers and stopped at two corners, (c) you flatten the back cover and (d) move last two corner fingers gently (one by one) over the corners of the tablet. You're done!For helpful video reviews search U-Tube. (That may require Flash which the Nexus 7 does not come with, but you can try the Firefox browser which does support Flash on your Nx7.)You can close the case and the magnet in the front cover will put your tablet to sleep. Open the case, the tablet wakes up. With the front cover swung all the way back around to lie against the back, you can put your left hand into the strap for a more secure grip on the tablet in its case. Video reviews show how the thin elastic black band can be routed to hold things snug and leave the screen clear.With the case open, if you just un-clip only those last two fingers you finished up with, by folding the back cover again you can swing the bottom long side of the tablet into one of the deep grooves inside the front cover. The case will then hold your Nexus 7 very nicely in Landscape orientation.Now - Why The MoKo Slim-Fit Is A Most Excellent Case For The Nexus 7This case protects the critical corners when (not if) the tablet is dropped)A surprising number of cases do not. Landing on a side can distribute the shock, but landing on a corner can concentrate them into a disaster for the tablet, and ruin your whole day.This case reasonably protects the sides as well and top when the case is open.When the case is closed, your tablet is really quite secure.The price is modest - this case costs as little as 7.6% the price of your tablet!(I chose the genuine leather version so that comes to a 12% insurance premium, but I love leather.)The workmanship - at these prices - is very good.Given the pain and anguish I'd feel if I accidentally smashed my tablet, I will happily order another identical MoKo Slim-Fit case whenever this one shows significant wear -- just renewing my tablet's insurance.I've had this case for over a month, used it all day, every day, and it is still as good as new.My only quibble is I wish these same good people made a similar case for my new Nexus 4 smart-phone...  and maybe one for people so you could protect them, enjoy them in portrait or landscape mode, but that's just being whimsical.

Still no go. Then I used another cable I had bought from the same vendor almost a year earlier, and the problem stopped. You could feel the difference in the tighness of the connectors of the last cable I tried.All three cables were from eForcity.  Don't know what to say about that except, buy more than 1 and preferably from different vendors. I think charging $20-$40 is criminal, but I would pay $10 for a known to be decent cable.  I think eForcity would eventually make it right, but a person would be more likely to think it's the hardware malfunctioning since the cable still works to some degree. That's what the 1.3b rating is about. Unfortunately there are no easy ways to tell if a cable is good other than to swap it out unless you have the proper measuring and testing equipment.Update 07/06/09--eForcity must be complimented for their customer service.  I received two replacement cables shortly after notifying them.They worked but I stuck with the original cable I had bought from them a year ago.

B003ES5ZUU,fine,How is the product?,"WHO NEEDS IT?This wire should work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x but it's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4 standard. You may consider this product if you have TWO devices that support HDMI 1.4. For these, the cable will carry through HD images and Ethernet data therefore eliminating the need for one dedicated Ethernet cable and one Ethernet port. Again, on a pair of connected HDMI 1.4 devices, it will eliminate the need of a dedicated audio cable if, let's say, your TV needs to send sound back to your receiver - it may have a built-in Blu/DVD player or get its input through an USB port. You may also consider this cable if you currently need an extra HDMI 1.3 cable but you are planning to to replace your existing equipment with some HDMI 1.4 ready hardware in the near future.As far as HDMI 1.4 stands, this cable is 'it'. It's the complete implementation because it supports ALL HDMI 1.4 features.HOW GOOD IS IT?- Behaves as a HDMI 1.3x 'high speed' or 'category 2' cable.- As a 'high speed' HDMI 1.4 cable, it supports video resolutions of at least 1080p and can go as high as 4K.- The 'data channel' (Ethernet support) works only with HDMI 1.4 ready equipment.- The 'audio return channel' is another feature supported by HDMI 1.4 ready equipment only. It will allow for audio to be sent 'back' from, let's say a TV to the HDMI 1.4 compliant receiver, therefore eliminating the need for a dedicated audio cable.- It should support all the HDMI 1.4 extra color palettes because those are implemented by the HDMI 1.4 compliant connected equipment.You may want to get this cable even if your equipment is not HDMI 1.4, it doesn't hurt to get a wire that supports a higher standard and, with free shipping the price difference is not that great. And, keep in mind that Amazon stands behind this product so returns should be easy.END OF REVIEW______________________________________________________What follows is the byproduct of me attempting to clarify 'HDMI 1.4' for myself and understanding this specific product's features. I thought I'd share.WHAT'S IN A NAME? (understanding this cable's features)- HDMI 1.4 is a new HDMI standard adopted in 2009, backward compatible with HDMI 1.3. This cable should work with your existing equipment.- HIGH SPEED indicates that this cable supports resolutions of 1080p or higher and 3D video (unlike the HDMI 1.4 STANDARD cables which, believe it or not, are limited to 720p/1080i - why? nobody knows).- ETHERNET means that this cable supports a full-duplex 100 Mb/sec Ethernet connection - if you have 2 HDMI 1.4 ready devices and they both need an network connection, this cable will carry through the Ethernet datastream to the second device, therefore saving you the need for one extra Ethernet cable.- Audio Return Channel is a feature that would save you the need of a dedicated audio cable between 2 HDMI 1.4 compliant devices.- This cable should support the full set of 3D features found in the new TVs.THE HDMI 1.4x DIFFERENCEHDMI 1.4 allows for the following new features:- Ethernet Channel - allows for the 2 connected devices to communicate with each other and share one network connection.- Audio Return Channel - eliminates the need of a second cable if you want to send audio from your TV back to your receiver.- 3D - It's supported by HDMI 1.3x but HDMI 1.4a specifically supports all the currently agreed-upon industry standards- 4K resolution - good to have it but there is nothing on today's market that would take advantage of this- Expanded support for new color spaces - by supporting sYCC601, AdobeRGB, and AdobeYCC601 it better aligns your display with the color spaces supported by digital cameras.- Type D connector - the 'Micro' connector is to be used by small, portable devices with supported resolutions of up to 1080p.The HDMI Consortium defines 4 broad types of HDMI 1.4 cables:* Standard HDMI Cable* High Speed HDMI Cable* Standard HDMI Cable with Ethernet* High Speed HDMI Cable with EthernetOf the above, only the 'High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet' (this one) makes sense and it's likely to emerge as the common HDMI 1.4 cable.Standard cables are limited to lower-resolution displays up to (approx. 720p or 1080i). High Speed cables support higher-resolution display (e.g. 1080p). They can deliver all video content currently defined for the HDMI standard (i.e. more than two 1080p/60 video streams, including 3D). HDMI cables with Ethernet are capable of sending 100/mbps over the HDMI Ethernet Channel. Since it is not likely that many HDMI 1.4 'standard' cables will be made or sold, I suspect that the crippled 'standard' type exists only to allow for calling the cables that support 1080p 'high speed' which sounds good and high-end.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt; ANSWERNOTFOUND",WHO NEEDS IT?This wire should work well with anything that supports HDMI 1.3x but it 's built to comply with the higher HDMI 1.4 standard,"(0, 136)"
B000065BP9,comparable,How about the quality?,"Before I look a long airplane trip to Asia, my husband recommended that I purchase these Sennheiser headphones.  I insisted that I didn't need them, and he argued right back that I wouldn't be regret buying them.  Ahem.  Yes, sometimes husbands can be right.The over-the-ear design ensures that most sounds -- even the annoying whine of jet engines -- are minimized.  I had no idea how loud airplanes were until I put these on instead of the airline supplied ear buds and my better, but still inadequate, iPod buds.  I listened to my iPod and the in-flight movies for hours before my ears tired.  The sound quality is much better in a quiet environment than in a noisy one since, yes, some noise gets through.  For those who listen to music in an office or in a college dorm, the fact that they don't leak much sound is a huge plus.  My only complaint is that they don't fold or collapse to take up less space in my briefcase.These make a great gift for the traveler or just for someone who wants lightweight, comfortable headphones. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The sound quality is much better,"(597, 629)"
B0019EHU8G,expensive,Is the cable expensive?,We bought these to connect our wireless blu-ray player to our 1080p Plasma TV - and they work perfect.

ANSWERNOTFOUND,We have more expensive,"(104, 126)"
B001V9LPT4,punchy,How was the bass?,"These headphones sound so good. I havent given them their full burn in time but they already produce such good sound and the bass is perfect, not too much not to little. I am impressed with them. As to construction, these are SOLID. Others have complained that the cable is too thin and wont last. HONESTLY its not that thin, and it feels VERY rugged. I am CONFIDENT it will last a long time. As to the tips, the ones it was wearing when i got it turned out to be a perfect fit i didnt need the others. As for the noise cancellation it works quite well, Put these on and turn on the sound and outside noise will be blocked. If there is louder outside noise simply turn these up a bit. THIS IS GREAT FOR LOUD KIDS, NAGGING WIVES/GIRLFRIENDS, BARKING DOGS, ANYTHING.....This is excellent quality from klipsch ANSWERNOTFOUND",the bass is perfect,"(121, 140)"
B0001FTVEK,spectacular,What is the sound quality?,"My wife and daughter have been after me to buy some wireless headphones for quite awhile because I generally stay up later than then and they are tired of hearing the TV at night.  I did some research and checked out all of my options..these seemed to be the best value for the money....Sennheiser well known for wired and wireless headphones....Well, I am QUITE happy with my purchase...it did take me a little bit to figure the tuning...to get it just right, but the sound is clear, the base is great and I can turn the volume on the TV all the way down and still listen...Highly recommend these!UPDATE 2008: I've now had these headphones for three years.  I am still loving them.  The sound is great and it has great range.  I can walk all over my house and still hear fine though when I get to the outer fringes of the range I'll hear bursts of static from time to time. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the sound is clear,"(465, 483)"
B0096YOQRY,big,What is the screen size of your tv?,"As Amazon consolidates reviews for various models in the same product line, please note that this is a review of the Vizio E320i-A0.If you purchase this TV it will bring you frustration.  The user interface (UI) installed on the Vizio E320i-A0 is Vizio's crippled Yahoo! TV Apps/M-GO interface, NOT the company's ""Vizio Internet Apps Plus"" interface.  It is clunky, frustrating, limited, and NOT user friendly.  While the TV is just fine as standard TV or monitor, and has a decent picture, adequate sound, and plenty of inputs, the UI is terrible and the remote is almost worthless.  It is not a good value as it comes at a premium over a similarly appointed HD set, and you can save nearly a C-note and a whole bunch of frustration if you simply buy a ""dumb"" 32-inch HD set and a Roku LT from Amazon.I purchased this TV in January 2013 on Vizio's promise that it would provide an outstanding Smart TV experience.  It was anything BUT outstanding.  Its primary app, ""M-GO"" (prominently displayed on both the unit's UI home screen and its lousy remote control), was billed as a ""revolutionary"" TV experience when I purchased the TV.  Bizarrely, M-GO wasn't installed on the TV at the time of purchase and didn't even become available for it until Summer 2013.  When it finally did arrive via Vizio's eventual firmware update, M-GO turned out to be all ""pay"" TV - no included content.  It was thoroughly disappointing and not ""revolutionary"" as promised.  I already have Netflix and Amazon Prime, so I don't need their lousy pay app.  Aside from M-GO, there are other apps available for the E320i-A0 -- some are preinstalled like Yahoo! Finance and Skype, but most are downloaded through the Yahoo! TV Apps store in the unit's poorly structured UI.  Strangely, Yahoo! TV Apps offers only a very limited number of apps for this ""smart"" TV -- a grand total of 134 (that's right:  ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR!) as of this writing on December 26, 2013 -- and most of them are either local news station apps from distant corners of the U.S., or paid anime/cartoon channels. Even the familiar apps like iHeart Radio have limited feature sets and don't offer the programmable, personalized channels you would customarily be able to set up on your computer or smart phone, but rather offer only a specified set of broadcast stations from select markets.  The entire experience is really bizarre.Ultimately, the greatest disappointment of the E320i-A0 is its abysmal UI and limited apps, which Vizio flatly informed me it has no intention to update to its current ""VIA Plus"" interface.  Again, the TV is good in terms of picture, size, sound and inputs, but the ""smart"" content is worthless.  If you buy this TV you will be stuck with the lousy UI, crappy remote, and crippled apps.  Be forewarned, and get a ""dumb"" TV and a Roku (or Chromecast, or XBox 360, etc); you'll be much happier you did. ANSWERNOTFOUND",32-inch,"(761, 768)"
B0081Q1KJU,large,What is the size of the kernel?,"These convenient, single-serve bags of popcorn go well in a lunch box or in a movie theater, and they're ready to grab and go. No popping and no waiting. They're priced at about 50 cents per bag, a lot cheaper than what cinemas charge for big containers that hold far more than most people want or need to eat.The taste is deliciously light and mild, without too much salt or cheese flavor. The pre-popped kernels are large and fluffy, but they're not crunchy, so if that's the texture you're looking for, you'll have to try another product. The coating is powdery, which I find preferable to an oily or greasy coating.I myself would have liked each serving to be a bit larger, but then I'm a big popcorn lover. I suppose I'll just have to take two bags along with me. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The pre - popped kernels are large and fluffy,"(391, 434)"
B005ZBZLT4,stale,How is the coffee?,"5:45 a.m. The alarm just went off. You want to be on the road before 7. You find the kitchen, get out the kettle and start the water boiling. Get out the Boodum, fill it up. Wait. Water boils. Pour it in the press. Wait.  Wait more. Can't wait any longer. Push plunger, drink, coffee is weak, pillow starts calling your name, you lose the will to shower, next thing you know, it's 8:15 and you're praying for the grid to melt down.OR, you get up at 5:45 a.m., drop a K-Cup in your Keurig, push a button and your cup runneth over (especially if you accidentally pushed the button with the picture of the mug on it).  And if it's San Francisco Bay Fog Cutter, you also get a deliciously rich, full-bodied, fragrant brew that is acid free and gentle on an early morning tummy.  Best of all, you can drink your Fog Cutter while waiting for the stuff in the Boodum Coffee Press to be ready. Now you can face the shower, the hair dryer, the curling iron and the eyelash curler without fear.I prefer the Boodum to the Keurig, but when you need coffee now, this blend can't be beat.  It's the best of all the K-Cup offerings that I've tried, and I've tried everything from Donut Shop to Newman's Own and most points in between.  It is my early morning wake up favorite.I was very amused, not to say impressed, by one reviewers comments about the packaging  He notes that there is a drawing of a K-Cup type machine on the front of the box and a list of various K-Cup brewers that will accommodate this version of the K-Cup.  He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.  The Rodgers Family, who own the company, are shown in a family photo on one side flap, along with an essay on the company's values.  The other flap has a description of the actual coffee.  This guy is a whiz in the a.m.  I'm happy if I find the sink on the first try.Anyway, this is the best pre-coffee coffee I've ever had. And it's an excellent main course coffee too.Enjoy.

Therefore, you won't tolerate this and the lift in energy won't happen - since you won't want to drink this.It's not a complete disaster.  Served chilled, it's seems a bit refreshing on a hot day (the moderate carbonation helps).If you can tolerate (or enjoy!) the musky apple taste you might like this drink.

He loves Starbucks coffee directly from Starbucks, as well as Dunkin Donuts (prepared at home).  He said that he liked the taste of the coffee (although it was more vanilla-y than he normally likes).  He said that he liked that the coffee was strong and ""packed a punch"", but was a little too fine a texture than he prefers.  Overall, while he does not really like vanilla-flavored coffee, he did like this coffee enough to buy it again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",he did like this coffee enough to buy it again,"(484, 530)"
B00BDFNTNQ,tasty,How was the taste popcorn?,"This popcorn is tasty and sweet.  It has a light cinnamon flavor and brown sugar.  The kernels are large between  and  of an inch in diameter.  What I liked the most was the tenderness of the coating.  Most sweet popcorn tend to have a thick and hard coating but this popcorn is light.  What I didn't like is the amount of non natural ingredients.  I don't know why it has to be so complicated.  Like with any other food product, I recommend reading the ingredients list and the nutrition information before purchasing. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This popcorn is tasty and sweet,"(0, 31)"

These caramels are so smooth and rich that you won't be able to stop at just one. The Lancaster's are very similar to the Kraft caramels but a little more firmer, but I still put them in the refrigerator to firm them up a little more just so they can last me longer because at the rate I'm going I will have eaten the entire bag before I know it.I love that these come in a beautifully sophisticated bag that you can give as a gift simply by sticking a bow on it.

B004FEN3GK,tasty,Is a tasty cracker?,"These crackers come packed in small 3x3 inch squares that are easy to toss into a lunch bag or to pack for a trip or snack while on the road in a car, airplane, etc. Each pack contains 8 crackers with a total of 250 calories and these crackers are quite tasty and filling as well. There is about 16g of sugar per pack, which is about 1/2 of one can of soda. Each pack also contains 14% of your daily sodium and 9% of your daily fat content, but no trans fats.The crackers would also be perfect for smores by a campfire and are just the right size, about 1/2 the size of the large sized graham crackers I remember as a child.It is a very filling snack and I enjoy these crackers and would recommend them to anyone who wants to have a few good snacks to toss into a lunch bag or for after school.

B002IEVJRY,subjective,How is taste?,"I've had a few other coffee drinks that come in a can, with milk + coffee, and they kind of all have the same taste.  This illy branded one is no different.  It's a unique flavor.  Somewhat like iced coffee with milk, but still different.  I enjoy the flavor, but it's not going to be like drinking an iced mocha coffee with cream/milk from your local cafe.I would compare this closely to some of the Java Monster energy drinks that I've had, more specifically the Mocha version of it.  The difference being that here you only get 8.45 ounces instead of the 16+ oz of the monster, and you're only getting coffee here with no additional craziness, which is good.I haven't had illy coffee that much, just a few times in Europe, and then some espresso pods for a cheap espresso machine I had, so I can't really fully say if it lives up to the name, but it was smooth coffee, albeit with chocolate and milk mixed in as well.  I'm not sure the price justifies how much you get, or the name on it in this case. ANSWERNOTFOUND",It 's a unique flavor,"(158, 178)"
B003YBH398,good,How do you like the box?,"The GoPicnic sunbutter & crackers ready to eat meal is very convenient for travel.  I took one of these to eat while on a hike with a friend.  I enjoyed all the components to some degree.  The sunbutter sunflower seed spread is good, tastes very close to peanut butter.  I thought there was plenty to spread around on the crackers, which had a nice light taste and satisfying crispy texture.  The cookie is satisfactory for what it is, not too sweet, but very thin, dry and crumbly; mine was pretty much a pile of cookie pieces.  The seed and fruit trail mix is great!  I like the tropical fruit strip well enough to eat it, but it was probably my least favorite component.Total calories as listed on the outside of the box is 490, with 52 carbs, 27 grams of fat (6 g saturated), and 9 grams of fiber.  You'll also get 20% of your daily iron needs and 10% vitamin C.  Total weight is 3.6 ounces, so this is a fairly calorically dense meal for the amount of food you're actually eating.  I don't know how long this would last if eaten during an active day (I ate again within three hours of eating my GoPicnic, so it lasted that long for me), so it might be more appropriate as a snack when hiking, biking, or any other high energy activity when one is travelling and/or out and about and not near home or other food source.As for the nutritional breakdown of the individual components, only the sunbutter, fruit strip, and crackers have an individual nutritional label on their specific package.  The cookie and trail mix are both Enjoy Life products, and their respective packages, while not having specific information, indicated that nutritional information could be found on Enjoy Life Foods' website.  The ingredients of all components are provided on the outside of the GoPicnic box, so you don't have to tear the box open for that information.The crackers have 60 calories, the sunbutter has 200, and the fruit strip has 70.  If the total calories equals 490, then subtracting the calories for these three items, that leaves 160 calories between the cookie and the trail mix.  I would guess the trail mix has more calories than the cookie, but I haven't bothered to look these up on Enjoy Life's website.Overall I like this lunchbox-type meal.  It's got a pretty good mix of carbs, fat and protein, and I enjoyed the taste of everything.  I'm intrigued enough to try some of the other GoPicnic ready-to-eat meals.

B00DBSGJ4E,not different,How it is the taste o the protein bar?,"Foremost, it is always disheartening to discover that one's ""strawberry"" snacks are actually gummy-candies made with gelatin. Please note that in addition to NOT being vegetarian, they are also NOT marked as Kosher. Obviously, those of the Jewish and Muslim faith will also want to avoid this product. And, one want to clearly note the ""spin"" in the name of this product ""Strawberry Fruit-FLAVORED Snacks."" Why must we require a decoder ring to determine real food from faux food?Secondly, it is important to know that the individual packets are exceedingly small. Each contain about seven or eight dime-sized candies ... totaling a whopping seventy calories. These are not guiltless. And, certainly, one does not want to buy these for a child as a substitute for a healthy snack. These NEED to be regarded as the candy they are (especially with the current childhood obesity rate). Certainly, a parent can feel comfortable include one or two of these a week in a child's lunch-bag (as a change from a mini-Twix or some comparable treat), but under no circumstances are these anything more than an empty-calorie snack.These currently have a health grade of a C+ at Fooducate (which also claims that there is only a nominal amount of fruit in these candies). Those with dietary restrictions (as a result of religious or ethical beliefs) may wish to buyAnnie's Homegrown Berry Patch Organic Bunny Fruit Snacks.

B004K0630M,strong,How did you like the aftertaste?,"I found this little energy drink tasty, with a light aftertaste and a kick of energy.  It didn't make me jittery, or my heart race.  It just made me feel awake, and I liked that about it.  I could taste the distinct flavor of strawberry and banana, and it didn't have that fake taste.This drink didn't amp me up, like some energy drinks.  Therefore, if you are looking for a jolt of energy, I wouldn't recommend this drink.I drank this in the afternoon, when I tend to get the afternoon blahs, and it has helped by eliminating the loss of energy I usually feel right after lunch.  I gave this 4 stars because, even though I liked the taste, I didn't love it.  I was a little bitter for me.  I would drink this again, but it wouldn't be my first choice of energy drinks.

B004JRKEH4,tangy,How was the taste?,"I tried the sister product, theTaco Bell Jalapeno Saucein August, and wrote a review for it.  Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's ""sauce,"" which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its ""bold,"" the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as ""bold.""  Now, the taste ofCheez-It Hot & Spicy; they got ""bold"" with that one.The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with ""tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps.""  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.Bottom line: ""Creamy"" this sauce is, but ""bold"" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American ""bold"" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for theSriracha,Crystal,Cholula, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.

B0081Q1KJU,big,Does this kernel its big or small?,"This baggie of ready-to-eat popcorn is pretty good, but not great. On the positive, the large popped kernels are light and fluffy and taste fresh. The cheddar flavor is good, but it's pretty mild and doesn't taste all that sharp. Unfortunately, I would estimate that at least 1/3 of the bag consisted of small pieces of broken up popcorn and not whole pieces. It was a mess to eat and there was too much &#34;shell remnants&#34; and dust to make it a super pleasant popcorn experience. It was undoubtedly much better than microwave popcorn as far as freshness and taste, but the lack of whole pieces and the mess factor was what knocked it down to 3 stars for me.

I thought the flavor could have been stronger and there could have been more cheese filling.  I could taste the flavor, but it sometimes got lost in the cracker flavor, which is good.  Indeed, the more I chewed a Crackerful, the more flavor I seemed to get from the cracker.This product proclaims on the front that it is an ""excellent source of fiber.""  One individual package has five grams of fiber, which is about 20% of the daily-recommended value of fiber.  However, those five grams of fiber is connected with 7 grams of total fat and 2 grams of saturated fat.  The total calories in the little bar are 130.  In my mind, connecting five grams of fiber to 7 grams of fat would argue against Crackerfuls being an ""excellent"" source of fiber.Another thing that influences my opinion of ""excellent"" is the list of ingredients, which extends for half the side of the box.  There are preservatives and all sorts of artificial ingredients.  What kind of person thinks a lengthy list of artificial ingredients and 7 grams of fat leads to the conclusion of ""excellent""?  Not that I am pitching any particular product, but two Fiber Choice tablets have 4 grams of fiber, 16 calories, and no fat.  The Fiber Choice is significantly cheaper and has eight ingredients.  You tell me which product you would classify as an ""excellent"" source of fiber, or at least a ""good"" source of fiber.  Perhaps excellent would be raw vegetables or fruit.I also think Crackerfuls are relatively expensive considering the available options.  For example, Austin cheese crackers tend to be somewhere around $0.17 to $0.20 per ounce.  Crackerfuls cost about $0.92 per ounce, depending on the quantity you buy.Moving beyond price and the hyperbole of advertising, I think the packaging is good.  Each Crackerful has its own individual package, which means that you can throw them in a lunch box or your pocket and not have to worry about them getting stale or soggy.Bottom line:  I like these crackers.  They have good flavor and texture and their package makes them portable.  While I panned the ""excellent"" nature of the fiber, I consider crackers like these a snack and having fiber is neither make or break for the cracker.  A bigger hurdle is the price, which I think is high as compared to alternatives.  The price suggests this product is more of a luxury than an everyday snack cracker.Good luck!

B004LA1LKI,thick,Are these crackers larger and thick?,"These cracker sandwiches taste like a stone-ground wheat cracker with Cheese Whiz in the center.  The filling is a reasonable amount, and the crackers are nice and crunchy.  They are a very tasty snack, but not necessarily a more healthy one.  They are advertised as being an excellent source of fiber, and while they do have 5 grams, they also have a lot of calories - 130 for ONE crackerful.  That's a little high considering bagel thins are about a hundred calories each, and more substantial.One cracker is a serving, and they are individually wrapped in the package for easy portability.  They are a bit expensive compared to other cracker snacks, but that is pretty common for anything touted as being more healthy.  However, for someone who loves snack crackers, or for teens involved in athletics, these could be a nice option if you can get them at a reduced price.  Overall, a tasty albeit expensive snack cracker; I would eat them again, but I'm not sure I would buy them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",and the crackers are nice and crunchy,"(134, 171)"

This flavor is definitely spicer than the Jalapeno Taco Bell sauce flavor. We liked it on (another fast food chain's!) chicken pieces!It's also good as a taco salad topping instead of dressing. We love to make our own taco salads, and none of us are fans of most bottled dressing, and this was actually nice.Also try the milder Taco Bell Jalapeno sauce. ANSWERNOTFOUND",pretty good,"(33, 44)"
B004K0630M,small,How satisfying is the serving size?,"This product was just alright for me.  It wasn't disgusting or something I didn't finish, but it wasn't something I would rush out to buy again.  One thing I don't like is that it is toted as being ""all natural"" but really...when I think of something natural, I think of 100% juice, not 70%.  It also has 20grams of sugar per 8.4 oz can.This seems to be another one of those pseudo-healthy products.  People see ""all natural"" and the name ""Jamba Juice"" and are duped into thinking this is something that is good for you.  If you want juice, drink juice.  If you want caffeine, have some coffee.Despite my feelings on it's lack of health benefits, the taste is decent.  If you are looking for an alternative to some of the other energy drinks on the market and prefer a fruity product, this would be a good choice.

B0015KAYN2,dry,What is your first opinion after use the skin product?,"We initially purchased Coconut Oil for dietary reasons. My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there.Highly Recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND",My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles,"(56, 111)"
B004FELBH8,nice,Is it a good textured coffee?,"I love fig newtons and when offered to review this product, I was hoping it would WOW me with the taste.  Not so much.  The cookies are large and nicely shaped, good to have out on a platter at a party.  The taste is....healthy, which that in itself is fine, if the cookie was healthy.  At 140 calories for 3 with 21 carbs and 7 grams of sugar, it really isn't all that healthy. I am currently counting calories in an effort to lose weight and giving up 140 calories for 3 cookies that don't taste sinfully delish just doesn't work for me.  If I am going to cheat with a snack, I could have 3 Oreo's for 160 calories, no comparison there.

B001LGGH40,sweet,How was the fruit?,"This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice. These probably  make up at least 80 to 90% of this juice by volume. The juice is a pleasant mild red or pink blush color. The mild kiwi and berry flavor appears almost as a pleasant aftertaste rather than the dominant flavor note.If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this has a pleasant but not outstanding flavor. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.While the marketing suggestion (""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.

B004DP0DGO,tasty,How is the taste of these stuff?,"I was surprised that the texture and taste was very normal considering the fat content was low and the fiber was high.  As an additive to something like yogurt or oatmeat cookies - this could be a great way to up your fiber without sacrificing taste.

I know that it is vitally important to drink plenty of water each and every day, but I have never been one who could make myself drink much of it.  It is because of this that I am always on the lookout for great water beverages and let me tell you, I have had little luck.  Most mix in leave an ick aftertaste because of the fake sugar.  I also greatly dislike carbonated drinks.  When I saw this Essentia product, I was very curious to give it a try.  Through the years, I have tried many different brands of bottled water.  Some have a ""soapy"" taste, some have just a plain weird taste and others are not bad.  Where does Essentia fall into?  I would have to say that it falls into a category that ranks high on my taste bud o meter.The bottle claims that it has a silky smooth taste.  I don't know if I would say that, but it does have a very crisp and fresh taste to it.  I spent the afternoon outside mowing (on a rather hot day) and when I came in, I cracked open the bottle of Essentia.  It was delicious.  Now, of course I was dying of thirst, lol.  An hour later I am nearly finished with the entire bottle! For me, that is amazing, lol.  I am really enjoying the way the water tastes (or lack of taste, whichever the case may be, lol)  I can honestly say that I will hopefully be purchasing more bottles of this in the very near future.

B005VOOKMY,not good,Does this coffee taste good?,"I got my box of gourmet Marley Coffee through the Amazon Vine program. I've been a big fan of coffee ever since I had to wake up at 4 am to bus tables at the Ramada Inn Hotel when I was a teenager. Back then, drinking coffee saved my job. In the 30 years since then, I've come to appreciate the multiple nuances about the classic brew. While I don't consider myself a coffee snob, I know what I like.One Love, according to the package, is Organic coffee and Fair Trade Certified, and a piece of the family dream,  which I don't mind standing up for. I still harbor a fondness for the music of the Marley men, and it was with great anticipation that I tossed a pod of One Love into my coffee maker.  For me the coffee was more on the light side of medium. Actually, it tasted on the light side of light.  I prefer a dark bold flavor but don't mind a good medium roast. The package also said Exotic Floral and Berry. Try as I might, I just couldn't pick the Floral and Berry notes or much of a coffee flavor and strangely, no real fragrance. Honestly, I could take it or leave it. I wouldn't recommend this. ANSWERNOTFOUND",it tasted on the light side of light,"(765, 801)"
B000FEH8ME,delicious,How about combination?,"I was a bit disappointed in the taste of this bar.  The nut flavor was good and nice and crunchy, but it didn't taste anything like blueberries.  It was kind of a gooey (or gluey), chewy bar with a taste that is hard to describe.  Not a bad taste, but I doubt it's anything kids would like that much.  I assume there is no added sugar, which is a real plus.  I suppose it is good to be eating something natural, but why not just eat the nuts and blueberries separately instead of crushed and compacted into a bar?  Convenience would be the only reason I can think of and these would have a longer shelf life than fresh blueberries.  Great for campers or hikers who don't want a high sugar snack.

The cinnamon flavor is much more subtle, but overall I liked how they taste.  My only real issue is that these are quite hard to bite down on.  I don't have sensitive teeth or anything, but I'm a little worried I'm going to break a filling when I bite down into these.

B001LGGH54,refreshing,How is drink?,"This drink is nice if you're looking for something a little different than juice or soda - it's kind of a cross between the two.  It's much sweeter and more soda-like than other carbonated juices I've tried, but not totally like soda either.  The nice twist is that it has your 100% DRV of vitamin C which is something you certainly won't find in soda.It was almost border-line too sweet, but because it's a fairly small reasonable portion (compared to a can of soda) it wasn't to the point where I didn't want to finish the drink.

B001LG940E,refreshing,How natural does it taste?,"Note: The zeros were cast by a troll and her gang, not real and decent people, and are against me personally and not the book or the review!Switch is a new, delightfully tasting carbonated drink. I love the equal blend of black cherry flavor--light and refreshing, with the light kick of the fizz of carbonation and the bubble feel in my mouth! In fact, that's how Switch bills itself: A perfect balance between juice and carbonation. That's my rave over this new drink.Now here's my reluctance to embrace the drink with five stars. I poured the 8.3 fluid ounces into a small glass (I have a huge collection of mismatched, but adorable clear glasses of all sizes, including this little bowl wine glass I removed from a college cafeteria in France many years ago). The glass held the contents of this tall, thin can of cheery cherry drink perfectly. But wait, by the time I quaffed the contents, I held the glass askance and asked: Is that all? I want more!In comparison my favorite beverage, Zero Sprite, holds 12 fluid ounces, a perfect amount to quench my thirst after a few hours working in the yard. I add ice to Sprite and don't care if it is watered down, but this Black Cherry Switch? No, one does not want to water down this exotic flavor. It must be drunk straight.As for its can slogan: ""100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't,"" I'm not sure about that. Let's examine it. ""What you want"" is ""100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All natural, Carbonated, Great taste and refreshment."" I agree with all of those. So far, so good.Let's look at ""what you don't"" want: ""No sugar added, No corn syrup, No preservatives, No artificial colors, and Gluten free."" True on all those.Next the label. This is where it gets confusing. Total fat 0g, Sodium 15mg, Total Carbs 35g, Sugar 33g, Protein 0g, and 130 calories. The 33 grams of sugar can be confusing. If none was added, then the 33g must come with the natural juice. And Switch does bill itself on 100% juice.In comparison my Sprite can contains 38g of sugar and 140 calories. I thought Zero Sprite contained zero sugar. My bad. I didn't read the label. It is free of caffeine, fat, cholesterol, fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, but no mention of sugar, which I assume comes from the corn syrup.I'm no nutritionist, but it seems that drinking Switch is much better than drinking a Zero Sprite, except that the can is larger so you get more.I would change those four stars to five now, except 8.3 Fl OZ still is not quite enough for one drink.Will I switch? No, but I will add Black Cherry Switch to my fridge for an occasional delightfully refreshing drink when I don't need more. Or else, I will have to trudge up to the headmaster, hold out my cup, and plead: ""May I have more, sir?""Wouldn't that be embarrassing at my age?

Over the years, I've tasted some baby food that I immediately spit out, and never fed to our children.  This wasn't bad and, in a pinch, I'd eat it again.  I think that the price is about $1.50 a pack ... is it worthwhile to you?  The taste is better than most, in my opinion, and it was very well received by the baby who ate it and wanted more.  It's packaging is convenient.  As parents, we can put the lid on a refrigerate as needed, although lids can easily get misplaced.  Since it is shaped like many juice containers today, kids are ""primed"" to accept this.  The nutrients appear to be very good.

B000FEH8ME,decent,What is your opinion on the amount of sugar in the snack?,"This was very impressive.  As a snack, it's basically mushed up dates with some cashews.  It has a VERY different consistency from grain based bars: imagine a sort of rolled-up fruit rollup, and you'll come close.  The cashews add a nice crunch, and it has a very distinct cherry flavor.For someone trying to eat naturally, it's tough to get any better!  Though what ""Rice Protein Concentrate"" is, I'm not sure, and I don't think it really needs any added sweetening from the agave and would prefer to see raw honey instead, or no sweeteners at all.

Decent amout of fiber (3g) and protein(6g). When I was done, I felt like I had actually eaten something (not like some 'airy' bars) yet is wasn't too dense to be a chore to chew. The reason I gave a 4 rather than a 5 star was the price. It's pretty similar to other organic bars, but my budget will usually have to go non-organic, like the South Beach Protein Fit bars.

I soaked the pasta for a minute (or 3) and it didn't really seem to soften it any but I'm sure it must have helped.  Then, based on the recipes provided, I put it in a large skillet with some Asian and basalmic oil and stirred it around.  It wasn't softening as quickly I I thought so I added a little water and put a lid on it for just a minute.  Perfect!  It came out soft and had absorbed the flavors beautifully.

B004K0630M,nice,How is the size?,"If you are looking for a caffeine boost this very lightly carbonated fruit juice based drink has a tasty and refreshing, not overly sweet taste with an appealing complex blend of flavors. Because it has fruit purees as well as fruit juices it looks and tastes like something you might whip up in a blender, minus the carbonation of course. As an energy drink it has some advantages. It has the same amount of caffeine as Red Bull but its ingredients are more natural than Red Bull or colas, and it doesn't have the bitter after taste of coffee.  It's smaller than the usual soda can size so a can of Jamba Juice slips easily into a purse or even a pocket. Jamba Juice does have more caffeine than most coffees, teas or colas so if you are looking for a smaller energy surge this will not be a good choice.

B004MO6NI8,odd,Do you like it to taste good?,I don't drink a lot of energy drinks but when I do then I normally reach for a NOS because of its great citrus taste. I have tried a handful of other energy drinks and I haven't liked the taste of them at all. No Fear Super Energy has a similar taste to NOS and I really like it as well. I would describe the flavor as a very sweet and smooth grapefruit taste. If you are looking for a sugar / caffeine rush then this will get the job done at the expense of high calorie count. I found that this 16 oz. can will give me a nice boost of energy for 4-5 hours. ANSWERNOTFOUND,the flavor as a very sweet,"(305, 331)"

B0016B9FSU,high,How about smoke point?,"I'm just not impressed with coconut oil.  You can use it like other vegetable oils, but you have to work around its properties.I am impressed with the quality of Jarrow coconut oil.  The product I received was very fresh, contains no sediment or solids, and the packaging was very airtight.  I tasted it straight out of the jar, and it is flavorless.  It does not impart coconut or any other flavor to food.  It's simply a fat you can use like most others.  But coconut oil is expensive, regardless of brand.  I'd been considering buying some to try before it was offered in Vine, so I've seen prices.Coconut oil is solid at room temperature.  The label recommends refrigeration after opening.  Unless you plan ahead and remove it from the fridge well before you cook, you'll have to chisel it out.  It gets really hard when it's cold.  I didn't know this, so that makes me an uninformed (till now) consumer.  I've used it for baking and it's fine, really.  If you don't mind getting up at 5:00 am to remove it from the fridge and let it soften!I haven't tried doing this yet, but I think that when making a ganache that I want to set quickly, I could add a little coconut oil to my cream and chocolate.  Just a little bit should help it set up without affecting the flavor or texture.  Not too much, though.  It will turn the ganache into a candy shell, I'm sure.If you passionately love coconut oil, this will not disappoint.  If you're merely curious, well, there are other things to be curious about.

B005Y10X9S,good,How is it the balance?,"I really enjoy this little cereal bar. Usually, especially when it comes to peanut butter, I am very picky. I don't like that ""fake"" taste that many food products tend to have. However, this protein bar really tastes of ""real"" peanut butter, but the taste is not so overpowering, it's as if you are eating pure peanut butter. The combination of peanut butter and the cereal/grain is just perfect and the crunch is not overly crunchy to the point it has become crispy, but yet it is not so soft and smooshy that the texture resembles that of nougat in a candy bar. The texture has a great balance, and between the ""grain"" for the base of the bar and the peanut butter flavour, it combines it to a distinguished but not overly powerful flavour so as to turn the Consumer (no pun intended) off. The size isn't tiny and compact, yet is not overly large and seemingly daunting. I feel it is just right as a nice ""grab and go"" kind of nutritional bar that has quite the enjoyable taste and is just the right size. I would comment, though, that this is a bar I'd probably get again, but I wouldn't eat more than one for a single sitting, nor would it be something I'd want to eat everyday - to me, especially for this kind of product, either the taste or the texture would get ""old"" and it would become less enjoyable.

If you are looking for traditional eastern green tea, I would suggest you give this a pass. This is definitely a blend - complex, with the taste of pretty much every ingredient coming to the fore at sometime. The price is reasonable compared to other K-Cup products and the consistency is constant from cup to cup.Verdict: While it will never be my &#34;go-to&#34; cup of tea, the distinctive blend is interesting and along with a teaspoon of honey, makes a pretty relaxing experience.All the best,Jay ANSWERNOTFOUND",More like a hint of green tea,"(0, 29)"

ANSWERNOTFOUND",The fruit punch flavor tastes just like Kool,"(171, 215)"
B00934WBRO,similar,What about the texture of the cookies?,"I wanted to like these snacks because they sounded healthy and easy to eat, a truly guilt-free, healthy snack. I've been eating them little by little over the last few days. I've eaten half the bag now and I can definitely say that I really don't like them at all. In fact, I have no desire to finish the bag.I definitely would not buy this snack again. Neither would I be tempted to take a bite if I found a bowl of them at a party.The package contains four one-quarter cup servings. Each serving consists of about a dozen round marble-sized dried apple clusters held together by concentrated apple juice mixed with potato starch.These round snack clusters are extremely crunchy, needing the powerful back molars to crush them. When I first did this, my mouth felt like it was full of a very dry crunchy substance that when crushed, gave off a dry powder around my mouth. There was nothing to relieve the dry feeling (no lubricating fat or liquid content). This was an odd sensation, and not a pleasant one. Even crunchy chips and nuts have a high fat content to lubricate them. I can't remember tasting anything before that was so crunchy and dry at the same time.After the extreme crunch, the next thing I noticed was an unusual sweetness on top of a very muted apple and cinnamon flavor. I don't mean a strong candy-like sweetness, but rather a sweetness not generally associated with an apple taste. Obviously, these clusters have been soaked in highly concentrated apple juice and the intense sweetness came from what I perceived as too much natural apple sugar. The final sensation I noticed was a nice tart after-taste that lingered after the snack was swallowed.The snack didn't taste bad, but it certainly didn't taste very good either. Personally, I did not like the crunchy dry texture, nor did I enjoy the unnatural sweetness coming from something with subtle apple flavor. The tart after-taste was mildly pleasurable.As an experiment, I grabbed a real apple and cut it up into bite-sized pieces. I tested the two snacks side by side. For me, the real apple was without any doubt the better snack. What I quickly realized in this comparison experiment was what the apple snack lacked over the real thing. An apple is juicy; the snack was dry. The apple has a very complex mixture of many subtle tastes; the snack was dominated by only two overwhelming tastes: sweetness and tartness. The real apple gave off a lovely strong aroma; the snack had very little apple scent at all, even if I stuck my nose into the bag immediately after opening it. Scent is a very important component of taste, and without it, the apple snack was just a dry, crunchy, sugar and tart taste.There is no doubt that dried apples are good for you, but any nutritionist would agree that in going from a fresh fruit to a dried product, a significant amount of enzymes, vitamins, and minerals are lost. I'll stick with eating fresh apples as a snack. ANSWERNOTFOUND",was so crunchy and dry at the same time,"(1126, 1165)"

I can eat one bag and satisfy my craving for a sweet snack without eating an entire box of caramel corn.

B007FK3CVM,not good,How is the quality of the taste?,"Aloe Gloe smells surprisingly good.  The taste isn't as great as the smell, but it wasn't bad.  Calling it Crisp Aloe seems pretty accurate to me.  It has a refreshing minty taste with an odd lingering aftertaste.  This might be thanks to the stevia.  My dilemma is if this is worth the price.  The first ingredient is water.  On the nutrition panel none of the amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, enzymes & minerals the bottle says aloe vera contains are listed.  Just sodium & sugar.  The lack of any nutrients on the nutrition facts makes me wonder if there is anything what so ever nutritional about Aloe Gloe.My normal choice for aloe is by the brand Lily Of The Desert.  Their aloe juice is certified organic containing only 3 ingredients:  organic inner aloe leaf, citric acid & potassium sorbate.  On the nutrition facts it says it contains 25mg calcium, 4mg magnesium, 58ml aloe filet (aloe gloe on the other hand does not even say how much aloe is actually in the water!)This is not something I plan to order on amazon.

He thought that they were a bit too sweet as well, but he (being a typical teenager) was able to polish off 3 or 4 with no difficulties.#3 tester was the most impressed.

With a tall glass of cold milk he was able to devour half a dozen of the sweet treats. (another teenager)I received an 8 oz box (18 cookies).

One package is a serving, and each package has two multigrain crackers with cheese spread sandwiched between them. First impressions after a few bites into my (broken) crackerful was that the taste was rather bland - the multigrain crackers didn't have much flavor to them and the cheese spread tastes only slightly better than the cheese goo you'd find in dollar store cheese-filled crackers. That said, these are definitely better quality, and better for you, than other similar options. There are no trans fats or MSG, and each serving has 8 grams of whole grain and 5 grams of fiber.

They then list ""natural flavors"" but unlike most other labels I see that on, actually detail what they are using (for the most part pieces of fruit: dried blackberry & rasberry pieces, black current and sunflower lecithin.I got this because my kids both love tea and the featured flavors are among my son's favorite.

Where Reese's peanut butter filling is almost dry and crumbly, this is thick and viscous. You won't have to worry about getting &#34;Butterfinger teeth&#34; because there isn't enough of that crunchy stuff to glom up in your teeth. It also isn't as intensely peanut butter-y tasting, which is to be expected given that it should taste more like a Butterfinger.I like to freeze these cream-filled candies because the flavor often intensifies when frozen, but the opposite was true with the Butterfingers. The flavor straight out of the box is mild but notable, and doesn't have that somewhat salty strength that Reese's does.

The key word on this package that got me to try it was Natural.I might be the only one but the biggest problem I have with flavored type coffee is not only the cloying taste but the extremely strong smell. If I want that strong a smell in my house I'll buy candles or spray. Usually, after about a fourth of the cup, I just don't want to drink much more - or smell it. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this coffee carries the trace of smell but it is neither strong nor overpowering. The taste follow suit - this is not a heavy roast and it does not have any bitter aftertaste. I found it exceedingly pleasant and finished the whole cup. In fact I found it so good that I would likely drink it on a regular basis. It is just perfect for me. Amazon's price is good as well. I'm kind of surprising myself by saying there's nothing not to like about this one. Give it a try! ANSWERNOTFOUND",cloying taste taste follow suit,"(497, 849)"
B004LA1LKI,great,How was the snack?,"The snack basically consists of 2 high fiber crackers with processed cheese spread between them. The crackers are fine, but the cheese paste tastes like a science experiment instead of real cheese.  I know you can't expect real cheese in a prepackaged, non-refrigerated snack like this one, but there's decent artificial cheese flavor and bad artificial cheese flavor, and this is definitely the latter.  (Also, the box reads ""Natural Flavors with Other Natural Flavors"", which is a pet peeve of mine - it sounds silly.  Just say ""Natural Flavors"" already!  It's like saying ""Rainy with a chance of showers"" in the weather report.)In terms of nutritional information, there's 7 grams of fat per serving, which is high, but 4.5 of those are unsaturated fats, which is more acceptable but still high. On the plus side, 5 grams of fiber per serving is great.The main draw of this product is the convenience of the packaging. Let's be honest: for the same amount of money, you can buy a box of crackers and some REAL cheddar cheese and have a much more natural, less processed, better tasting end result - but you'd have to keep the cheese refrigerated and put the snack together yourself, whereas you can just throw a couple of these pre-made and wrapped packages in your backpack and have a quick snack handy in case your toddler runs out of fuel when you're out and about. For a kid's snack, it's sure to be a hit, because it's convenient and not too unhealthy. I'd even consider buying it again for my 3 year old. But for adults, I'd have to think there are tastier and healthier ways to get cheese-on-a-cracker than this.Additional note: my wife adds that she actually liked the taste of the cheese. In her opinion, if you like the cheese that's in the other Ritz cheese-and-crackers products, it tastes exactly the same and you won't be disappointed.  I confess to not having a ton of experience with Ritz cheese spread, so maybe it's just that I'm a cheese snob :) So, second opinion from my better half: this isn't any worse than other Ritz crackers with cheese paste.  I'll even upgrade the product from 3 stars to 2 because of this! ANSWERNOTFOUND",this is n't any worse than other Ritz crackers with cheese paste,"(2008, 2071)"

I wouldn't go that far.  Maybe on a really hot day, or if you put some on a plate and microwaved a few seconds.

I did think it rather humorous, however, that this huge box contained one little bar.These smell really good, probably due to the fruit juice used as the sugar source in them. And the flavor is nutty and tastes very much like blueberries, moreso than most ""blueberry"" products. But that's where the pleasurable parts end. The texture is like someone sat on your Great Aunt's fruitcake on a long trip to Oshkosh and then gave you a slice. It seems compacted and gooey. Nothing you'd want more than one of.

B001LG940E,refreshing,How natural does it taste?,"Note: The zeros were cast by a troll and her gang, not real and decent people, and are against me personally and not the book or the review!Switch is a new, delightfully tasting carbonated drink. I love the equal blend of black cherry flavor--light and refreshing, with the light kick of the fizz of carbonation and the bubble feel in my mouth! In fact, that's how Switch bills itself: A perfect balance between juice and carbonation. That's my rave over this new drink.Now here's my reluctance to embrace the drink with five stars. I poured the 8.3 fluid ounces into a small glass (I have a huge collection of mismatched, but adorable clear glasses of all sizes, including this little bowl wine glass I removed from a college cafeteria in France many years ago). The glass held the contents of this tall, thin can of cheery cherry drink perfectly. But wait, by the time I quaffed the contents, I held the glass askance and asked: Is that all? I want more!In comparison my favorite beverage, Zero Sprite, holds 12 fluid ounces, a perfect amount to quench my thirst after a few hours working in the yard. I add ice to Sprite and don't care if it is watered down, but this Black Cherry Switch? No, one does not want to water down this exotic flavor. It must be drunk straight.As for its can slogan: ""100% of what you want and 0% of what you don't,"" I'm not sure about that. Let's examine it. ""What you want"" is ""100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All natural, Carbonated, Great taste and refreshment."" I agree with all of those. So far, so good.Let's look at ""what you don't"" want: ""No sugar added, No corn syrup, No preservatives, No artificial colors, and Gluten free."" True on all those.Next the label. This is where it gets confusing. Total fat 0g, Sodium 15mg, Total Carbs 35g, Sugar 33g, Protein 0g, and 130 calories. The 33 grams of sugar can be confusing. If none was added, then the 33g must come with the natural juice. And Switch does bill itself on 100% juice.In comparison my Sprite can contains 38g of sugar and 140 calories. I thought Zero Sprite contained zero sugar. My bad. I didn't read the label. It is free of caffeine, fat, cholesterol, fiber, Vitamin A and Vitamin C, but no mention of sugar, which I assume comes from the corn syrup.I'm no nutritionist, but it seems that drinking Switch is much better than drinking a Zero Sprite, except that the can is larger so you get more.I would change those four stars to five now, except 8.3 Fl OZ still is not quite enough for one drink.Will I switch? No, but I will add Black Cherry Switch to my fridge for an occasional delightfully refreshing drink when I don't need more. Or else, I will have to trudge up to the headmaster, hold out my cup, and plead: ""May I have more, sir?""Wouldn't that be embarrassing at my age?

I ""found"" them a few weeks ago and thought why not eh - I was tired of drinking the same old coffee.And what a nice surprise it was. This coffee smells good when its brewing - quick as that brewing experience is in a Keurig coffee maker. The first sip - with half and half and a small teaspoon of sugar sealed the relationship. This is simply said a well balanced cup of coffee. A fully body taste without the bitterness that coffee can often contain. No lingering after taste, a huge plus for me in a coffee.

B002IEVJRY,full,"What is the taste, taste and quantity of food they serve?","I am an iced coffee (particularly mocha flavored) connoisseur. No, I am really, really serious about it! Not the coffee shop $5 a piece kind - the ones you buy in glass bottles or cans. When I say ""connoisseur"", I mean drinking one almost every day for the past eight years kind of connoisseur. Having stopped drinking one popular brand, and not being able to find a substitute - I ended up resorting to blending my own. However, this completely killed the portability that I loved, as well as the ability to grab one our the fridge and head out the door.Then I was asked to try this brand. Let me just say I am immediately putting this on ""subscribe and save"" for a monthly delivery.What makes it good is its balanced flavor. You know you are drinking coffee, not chocolate milk someone put into a used coffee cup. Not black coffee some tried to flavor a bit too late with a sugar bomb. This drink is well blended and the flavors are well balanced.While I absolutely appreciate they kept calories down (100 calories a serving) - I think they accomplished this by using quite a few ""ingredients"", many I needed to look up to see exactly what they were. While they don't sound life threatening, it makes the list of ingredients twice as long as a Starbucks Frappuccino in a glass bottle (although it does have 80 less calories than the Starkbucks brand at only on ounce less drink per can)coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan. Caffeine content: 81 mgSo, if you are a person who really doesn't like a lot of chemicals or funky science going on in their food - you may be tempted to skip this one. There are other drinks one doesn't need a chemistry degree to ingest.With that said, the taste is smooth and balanced. I new I was drinking coffee - although it had the chocolate and milk flavors that I crave as well. I didn't get the shakes from too much caffeine and the price is reasonable compared to what you would pay in your average grocery store for similar products. Like I said, I am putting it on subscribe and save. However, I will probably still be on the lookout for iced coffee products that use more natural ingredients.

B001LGGH40,fair,What amount of minerals and vitamins present in this ?,"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me of nothing that I had every tasted before. I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.Shawn KovacichCreator of numerous books and DVD's.

B004BKLHOS,more,How much fiber do you have?,"The clear selling point of anything labeled ""back to nature"" is going to be its healthier ingredients and the crackers do a good job of stacking up against most popular brands in that area.  They have no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors and no high fructose corn syrup--that alone puts them ahead of the usual in my book, especially the lack of HFCS which is so hard to avoid. They have slightly less sugar (7 g vs 8-10 for other brands), significantly less sodium (130 g vs 200 and up), slightly more fiber, slightly fewer calories (about 15 cal fewer per serving).  So yes, they're certainly better for you.The question of course then goes to taste, a much more subjective aspect.  Personally, I found their taste slightly less rich, which is a negative, but better in two categories. They are noticeably less sweet which I prefer as I'm not a fan of sweet foods; obviously others may have a different view on that.  They are maybe a bit more dry, though it's hard to tell as graham crackers in general seem a bit dry to me.  But they are definitely crispier than the usual other types.We don't go in much for crackers in our house, but on the few occasions we'll do so, I'd certainly pick up these rather than the larger brands due to their healthier ingredients, less sweet taste, and similar overall taste.

B000FEH8ME,much,How is the taste?,"...and have to say, it is about as good as fruit and nuts smashed into a bar can get. Having succumbed to the urge to say that, the price is high, even for an organic- and ingredient-pure snack. I keep trying these kinds of bars thinking one just might have some real texture and some flavor other than sweet and sweeter.On a more positive note, I hope the Pure Organic people keep at it. They're on the right track. I loved the ingredient list, that nothing in the bars is processed (other than being ground and how else would one make nuts and fruits into a bar!), that the makers support the celiac Disease Foundation, and that they are made in the USA.Will I buy them to eat again. Sure. When I travel. But I still hope Pure Organic will keep at it. Those bars aren't what one could call delectable yet. Maybe I'm hoping for miracles. ANSWERNOTFOUND",good as fruit,"(35, 48)"
B005XVZKGA,great,How is water?,"Avitae 90 Mg Caffeinated Water, tastes exactly like purified water and you don`t taste any other additives. The caffeine is a plus for me because I recently started a diet and began having horrible headaches only to find out I was having caffeine withdrawals from all the sodas I was drinking, but this caffeinated water helps you get over those caffeine headaches without any extra calories. The water is smooth and refreshing. Great water for people that need that extra jolt without having to consume coffee, tea, energy drinks,or sodas.

B004K0630M,pleasing,Why do I have a pleasing taste?,"I'm not big on the energy drinks and haven't used them a lot but I will use one when I need that extra boost to get through the night shift. This one is pretty good and different. It has a kinda odd flavor, kinda tart, very sweet, with a faint baking soda flavor in there somewhere crossed with very light carbonation. It's supposed to be Strawberry Banana but I couldn't really taste much that I could recognize as strawberry or banana. But other than being a little too sweet it was ok. I can say that I liked the taste of it just a little, at least I didn't hate it or dis-like it as I do most of the energy drinks. I can also say that I like it better than Red Bull. It would have been better if it wasn't so sweet and maybe had some carbonation. As for its effectiveness as a energy boost I'll have to get back to you on that. If it gets me through the night shift then it will be one that I wouldn't mind using again and probably will if I can find it.After using this last night it did help me a lot. I had more energy through the night shift and didn't have that much of a drop when it was running down. The best part was that it gave me the energy boost that I needed without making my jitter around like a frog on a hot sidewalk. It was good enough that it could possibly become habit forming since I could really use another shot of it today to help get over the slight hangover feeling that I had this morning. But fortunately for me they are expensive enough that I cant indulge myself and end up using them on a daily basis. ANSWERNOTFOUND",kinda odd flavor,"(189, 205)"

B000LWCR26,earthy,How is the taste?,"I am really enjoying this tea, which I have purchased from Amazon many times now. I can see why it is called ""honeybush,"" as the taste and aroma truly do resemble honey. It has a mellow, natural sweetness to it that really does not need sweetening, and a very mild, easy taste that reminds me of chamomile tea, in that it has a soft, understated character with no bitter note or aftertaste, and a bit of a woodsy note. I have never added milk to this tea, but I may try it and see what it does. I love it straight, and have even enjoyed the random mug I have accidentally allowed to cool down too much. I have been able to have it either in the early morning, midday, with meals, between meals, on an empty stomach, or very late at night--all with no issues. The taste is honey-like and light, with the tiniest hint of mesquite when freshly poured. If it sits for a considerable amount of time, it develops an additional note that reminds me of fig leaves. This is a completely caffeine free tea that is even given to tiny children and to people taking meds, as it does not interact adversely with anything or have any known adverse effects to the health. I have heard it is great for the skin, and perhaps it is all true, from what I have noticed. I would call this a nourishing tea. If it has any calming effects, they are probably all cerebral, and it may just be due to how pleasant and easy it is to drink, and how relaxing pleasant things usually are. If you are looking for a mellow and pleasant cup of tea that is smooth and easy without being harsh on the stomach or nerves or, alternately, putting you to sleep, I recommend giving this honeybush tea a try.

This is one of the best instant &#34;hot meals&#34; available. It doesn't require a refrigerator or microwave, and it is safe for most common dietary restrictions. It's not overly salty, sugary, or greasy. It's not really all that nutritious (mostly refined carbs and salt water, like most noodle bowls). However, it has a little bit of soy protein and fiber, and the noodles have a nice texture, so it feels like you are eating something substantial. After a long day of travel in an unfamiliar city, the broth made with fresh miso can, in the words of Les Stroud, &#34;make you feel human again.&#34;My &#34;cooking&#34; method is:1. If a sink is available, open the fresh-pack noodles and rinse them. I've noticed that fresh-pack noodles have plasticy smell to them if you don't rinse them first. If no sink is available, I do two iterations of step 2.2. Put the noodles in the provided bowl and fill with boiling water. Cover with lid. Let sit for 2-3 min.

B0015KAYN2,dry,What is your first opinion after use the skin product?,"We initially purchased Coconut Oil for dietary reasons. My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes.

I diluted it in water (dilutes fairly easily) and then added ice cubes for an icy cold drink.Each box comes with ten individually wrapped packets. The corner of each packet is pre-cut, so it is easier to open and you don't have to hunt for hard to find perforations. Each packet is good for a 16oz drink.

B000FEH8ME,not strong,Can you taste this oatmeal?,"I decided to try the Wild Blueberry Pure Organic Raw Fruit & Nut Bar after trying the Cherry Cashew version and liking it but finding the ""cherry"" flavor to be very subtle.  In addition to being Certified Organic, this bar is gluten-free and vegan. Furthermore, the Wild Blueberry flavor contains a full serving of fruit, is a good source of fiber (3 grams), and provides Omega-3s as well. There is also a decent amount of protein (6 grams, slightly less than the Cherry Cashew bar), and although the amount of sugar is higher than I would've liked (19 grams, or almost 4 teaspoons), the bar is naturally sweetened using agave nectar only, with no other added sugars added.The bar was thick and dense in appearance, with an almost slightly sticky feel. The taste definitely tastes fruity, but I could not detect a blueberry flavor at all.  Rather, as other reviewers have suggested, the taste is more reminiscent of Fig Newtons, most likely because the first ingredient is actually dates (blueberries were significantly further down the list).  The bar also did have a nutty flavor, and in fact it contains cashews, walnuts, and almonds.  Overall, I liked the taste (I like dates!), but I thought the ""Wild Blueberry"" label was deceiving, and I definitely have had other bars that I prefer.In the end, I liked the Cherry Cashew Pure Bar a bit more than this one, and I would rate the nutritional profile of that flavor as slightly better as well. Although these bars are not perfect, I would definitely recommend them to someone with specific dietary needs, such as vegan or gluten-free.

Each packet is supposed to be mixed with 6 oz of water, and going over to make a full cup with each packet results in a bland and decidedly non-tasty cup o' joe.

In this case, I think the answer is yes.Keebler has tried to create cookies using only the ingredients that you would use if you were making them at home. They contain no artificial ingredients or flavorings. The result is a very appealing cookie that definitely does have a ""homemade"" taste and consistency. Most store-bought cookies I've tried have either a chewy or a crispy texture. These are buttery and delicious and have a light, slightly crumbly texture. Definitely not chewy, but not what I would call crisp either.The packaging is the new type that has a peel-up tab that self sticks to the package to reseal.

That smell of cheese hit me in the face.  But not cheese - specifically, it smelled of cheese-whiz.  That stuff was awesome - when I was in college.  You know cheese-whiz?  I used to love spraying that junk on RITZ crackers on college while watching TV.But I'm not in college anymore.After the strong smell of fake-cheese hits you, a hint of wheat makes itself known.  That's the cracker part of these things.I pulled out the ""crakerfull"" only to have it come apart in my hand.  I'm not kidding - the cheese-like-substance isn't strong enough to hold the crackers together.  As I pressed down (very lightly) on one end, the whole thing flipped open.  I had to squish it down to keep it together.Taste: It tastes just like you'd expect: it tastes like the american cheese-whiz stuff on ""wheat"" crackers that have that grainy texture to them.  They're not terrible - but I wouldn't say they're good.  I had one as a snack, and was hungry shortly afterwards.  I would have originally thought maybe I can take these golfing which I like to do with things like this - but they don't taste that good, and they don't hold you over for very long.* I have no idea why the RITZ logo is on these.  RITZ crackers are utterly distinctive in their own right.  They have a specific taste and texture unlike any other cracker made in America.  These things are nothing like a RITZ product, and I have no idea why they would associate the RITZ brand with some pseudo-cheese product on wheat-ish cracker boards.-So, yeah, I didn't really like them.

B003XDH6M6,soft,How is the texture?,"I was sort of excited to try these because licorice is one of my favorite sweets & I'm always eying up new flavors to try out. This just sort of seemed a natural fit for me as far as a vine review goes.The good thing is that the texture to these are pretty good. It's nice & chewy without being too chewy or too soft. It's a happy medium, although I do recommend that you try to get these as fresh as possible since I can't imagine trying to eat these when they've a little old or have been exposed to air & not stored properly.The bad thing is that these just have this funky aftertaste to them. The basic taste is fine enough. It doesn't taste like pomegranate & normally I'd be OK with this since candy often labels things ""watermelon"" or ""strawberry"" when it doesn't taste anything remotely like the fruit. Since this is supposed to be mostly organic & natural, I really expected it to taste more like actual pomegranate. Then there's the occasional weird aftertaste these have to them that's somewhat unpleasant. I can't really explain it but it's not a taste that I'd really care to have in my mouth.One thing I do want to mention is that out of the 11 ingredients in this product, only 3 are organic. That doesn't bother me much, but I know that there are some people who get irritated at how some labels mention ""organic"" but only a small part of it is actually organic. At that point you really can't call the product organic since it has non-organic product in it. (There's no USDA organic label on this anywhere, if you were wondering, which can only be put on if a certain percentage of the product is organic.) Note that this product didn't have ""made with organic ingredients"" on it, just ""made with organic sugar"". The people who label watch for organic products will know what that means. I mention all of this because I know some are very picky about product that have organic anywhere on it.Overall I wasn't really that enthusiastic about this product. It wasn't horrible but I can safely say that I probably won't be buying any of these in the future. I might & I stress *might* try one of the other flavors, but that'd only be if the price was right.EDIT:Updated to say that I won't be buying any of this in the future. The licorice I ate later is really making me feel a little gross. Like another reviewer said, it's just sitting there like a pile of lead & is giving me some pretty bad indigestion. If you have a cast iron stomach (which admittedly mine isn't as strong as it once was but is still pretty good), then you probably won't have a problem with this.

These little bars are great for those busy times.I really like the taste of these snack bars.  They are very cinnamony, and I noticed that flavor much more than the raisins.  The texture of the first bite really surprised me.  They have an almost gritty feel to them, perhaps because of all the fiber.  Although that first bite was a little surprising, I didn't find the texture objectionable.  These bars have only 3 grams of fat, but two-thirds of that is saturated fat.  For 130 calories, they do feel quite filling.These are a convenient snack to keep in a purse or your car.  However, for those first starting on the South Beach diet, it is not obvious that you cannot have these bars until phases 2 and 3.  There is a little notice on the side of the box that is is for those phases, but that notice is at the very bottom and quite small.They do contain palm kernel oil, and I am not a fan of that.These make a nice snack for someone following South Beach or something similar, and I love their convenience, but I wouldn't make them a daily treat.

As far as i could tell there was no difference. It has the nice chewy texture that makes licorice unique. The flavour is also quite good.Being organic means it should be a healthier option too. I gave it 4 stars because my children don't like it. They took a taste and stayed off the entire pack. So i guess my kids must have noticed a difference but they could not explain to me what the difference was.So, while i consider it good for adults, note that buying it for children might not work.

The flavor is subtle, but you absolutely pick up the watermelon flavor. Its not drowned out by the strawberry, which is usually the case in strawberry-watermelon flavored food items. This drink is lightly carbonated, much less than a standard cola drink, but the carbonation transforms the drink from a juice-like, powdered drink type to a much more refreshing, original beverage. The drink is not overly sweet, but just enough to enhance the watermelon-strawberry flavor, and not too caloric. I am anxious to try the other flavors.

The texture is a little odd: It's not dry and it doesn't have that cardboard characteristic a lot of organic foods have, but it is kind of sticky and gooey.  The sweetness from the fruit sugars in the bar is overpowering and a little cloying.  You can't even really taste the blueberry over all the other ingredients.  For an organic bar, though, it's quite good.  At 190 calories it's not quite a meal, so pairing it with something less sweet to make it a meal would be ideal.

B00338DPRG,firm,How are pasta is firm?,"I'm not the kind of person who can rave about packaged pasta. it just isn't in me. To my mind, the pasta is usually just a vehicle for whatever topping we're going to put on it! That said, however, Barilla has become our most common choice over the last few years. Why? A couple of reasons, really. Price-wise, this is usually one of the more economical choices. The pasta is reliable and tasty, the variety is impressive, there is a whole grain option, and there is even a new PLUS line for those looking to increase their protein intake.Recently, I received a whole slew of Barilla to try out. Some of these are regulars on my table (like the Whole Grain) and some were first time uses. Again, though, Barilla is a brand I swear by and use almost every week. I just find it hard to gush about food products.Whole Grain Spaghetti (4 1/2 stars): We frequently opt for the whole grain option, I suppose it seems like the healthier alternative. As we've gotten older, we've consciously tried to up our fiber intake and this does so in a pleasant way. Made with 51% whole wheat, we also think these are tastier than traditional pasta. Typical spaghetti preparation.Whole Grain Thin Spaghetti (5 stars): A thinner choice, this gives you the benefits of the whole grains and fiber but mixes better with sauces.Whole Grain Linguine: (5 Stars): One of out preferred choices.  Obviously, we are crazy for the Whole grain option, but like the flat linguine as the option that works best for think and rich sauces.Mezze Penne (4 stars): We eat a surprising amount of Penne and this Mezze is slightly thinner in cylindrical format. Cooks up and maintains its shape well. We often do baked dishes where we cook the pasta first, then bake it. Even double prepared, they hold their shape well and taste good. Better integrity under these circumstances than the wider penne.Linguine Fini (4 1/2 stars): These delineations amuse me. It had never occurred to me that I needed an even thinner Linguine, so (of all of these choices) this was probably the one I wouldn't have tried on my own. But we tend to like this (angel hair is one of our top choices), so this was tasty enough.Oven Ready Lasagna (4 stars): I don't do lasagna very often and never from scratch! If you are a short-cut cook like me, you want things to make your life easier. These noodles don't require any pre-boiling and cook while the dish is baking. It's a brilliant idea that works well for the most part. Due to inconsistencies in layering, you might have sections that crisp up more than others. But a little unevenness is a willing trade for the pain of making traditional lasagna.Ditalini Soup Cuts (4 stars): This is one of the products that I probably wouldn't have picked up of my own accord. I'm simply not a soup maker. But these little pasta cylinders were actually very nice, and super easy to use. We added them to a crock pot preparation. I was afraid they might dissolve completely, but they held up well and added a nice dimesion.Penne Plus (4 stars): This is like the premium choice in Barilla, and so it is more expensive. It's not my first choice. But it would appeal to those that are looking to add protein to their diet, like vegetarians. It has protein and Omega 3's, and is made with healthy ingredients like flax seed and legumes. It takes a little longer to cook, but still tastes fine. KGHarris, 3/12.

B00934WBRO,perfect,Which size is perfect?,"This is a healthy snack that actually is healthy and tasty. I am impressed with the ingredients and the information on the nutrition label.I don't know what type of apples are used to make these clusters but they have both a slightly sweet and slightly tart taste similar to a McIntosh or Granny Smith apple.  The taste is not overly sweet which is a good thing because products that are overly sweet usually add sugar or artificial sweeteners and these have neither. These are a bit on the dry side and taste great with a glass of water.The four ingredients listed are organic apples, organic apple juice concentrate, organic potato starch and organic cinnamon. As a result a 1/4 cup serving has only 60 calories, no fat, 14 grams of carbohydrates and 2 grams of fiber.  The only negative for me is that there are no added vitamins and minerals and all you get is 2% of the daily recommended amount of vitamin c and 1% of calcium.It is great to see a healthy snack that is healthy.  There are tasty and I enjoyed snacking on them during the day instead of reaching for a cereal bar or some type of chips or rice cakes which would likely have had more fat and carbohydrates.

B00DF0KXYK,fresh,How is the popcorn?,"This microwave popcorn comes from my favorite brand of popcorn, which I usually make in my hot air popcorn popper.This tries to incorporate a nifty bowl into the bag, by opening in such a way at the top that the bag becomes a ready made bowl.  In this regard it is an epic fail.  The ""bowl"" bag has a red strip that you pull which supposedly causes the top of the bag to open widely into a bowl shape.  I could not manage to pull the top red strip in the way shown on the package, and instead had to rip the entire top of the bag off.  I had to then pour the popped corn into a big bowl to eat it, the same as any other microwave popcorn.  I consider myself very handy at most such tasks too.  This simply doesn't work the way it was intended to.The popcorn is almost delicious if you like a lot of salt on it.  There is no butter flavor at all that I could detect, but since I never put butter on my popcorn I didn't miss it, but still, I was expecting to taste at least a bit of butter in this.This fully popped and was almost starting to burn in the microwave in under two minutes, although the directions say to pop it for 2 - 2.5 minutes.Even if I had managed to get the top of the ""bowl"" open as directed, there was no flat bottom on it that would have allowed it to stand up on its own.  The taste of the popcorn is very good however so for that I gave it two stars.  There were more unpopped kernals than I would have liked.I don't recommend this.

The taste is absolutely perfect.  The food is very sweet like fruit is but not artificially so.  The greens are in the perfect balance.  Not too much to be overbearing, but the pear fruit taste balances it out perfectly. It was gobbled right up!The container is very interesting- it is flat with that screw on top.  The top has a seal on it, and is very easy to remove, but not so much that it will come off if you have to transport it.  Once you open it, the spout is easy to get the food out of, and then if you need to re-cap it, you can do so and keep the rest until the next day.I doubt that this food would last that long, however. It is so delicious that it will be finished most likely.  The packet is also fairly easy to get most of the food out of too, leaving little waste.This food is so good that my entire family right up to Daddy kept trying to eat it all instead!  It would make a great snack for traveling even for plder kids on the go (even moms).  Just enough for an energy boost and a great little snack.I can not recommend this food highly enough.

The bag claims that it is 30% larger and fluffier than the leading ready to eat savory popcorn, I'd agree with that and was thinking when I opened it that the kernels were in fact very big before I ever saw the print on the package about kernel size.The cheese taste is tangy and just the right amount. Since it is a white cheddar, there is no orange residue left on the fingers. The calorie count is 240 cal per bag, for the 1.5 oz bag, I thought that was pretty good since there is more than enough for 1 person. The popcorn tasted fresh, not stale and not overly processed.

B004K00DGC,low,How is the expectation?,"Jamba All Natural Energy Drink is being sold as a healthier alternative to other caffeinated sodas and ""energy"" drinks. It does have fewer calories. The Jamba drink contains 90 Calories, which is less than the 110 found in Red Bull. The equivalent quantity (8.4 oz) of most non-diet sodas contains about 105 calories. Obviously it has a lot more calories than a diet soda, but it also does not contain artificial sweeteners that some consider unhealthy.The Jamba ingredients described as ""natural"" but it does have added flavorings and sweeteners.I like most Jamba products but this one has a watery flavor. I would describe it as carbonated water with a fruity flavor.Energy drinks are just another way to say caffeinated drinks. This has about 80 mg of caffeine. That is about the same as a can of the popular Red Bull drinks. The same volumes of most sodas have about 25-35mg depending on the brand. A cup of coffee has about 100 - 175 mg of caffeine, depending on the coffee and how it's brewed. If you want some caffeine boost, this may have more that most sodas, but it has far fewer that a typical cup of coffee.If you are looking for a reasonably healthily quick caffeine boost, without a lot of flavor, that you can slam down, this may be the drink for you.

B002IEVJRY,mild,How is the coffee is rather?,"Initial thoughts:The coffee is straight black. I didn't expect this, but I like that it is (it's hard to find a cold coffee in a can sans milk and sugar). The coffee is surprisingly creamy on the first sip. It has a full taste that hits the back of my tongue particularly well. It lacks the bitterness I might otherwise assume with many cold coffees but it does leave a metallic aftertaste (as well as what seems to be grapefruit).Pour:I'm pouring it into a mug and I am pleasantly surprised with how concentrated the coffee seems to be. It pours dark and thick and even leaves a little frothiness on the side of the container I'm pouring into. The coffee still leaves a bit of a metallic aftertaste, however.Look:As mentioned, the coffee is dark... really dark. I would think that if you like weaker coffee, you could dilute this and be fine with the results. I actually like my coffee stronger and this fits the bill pretty nicely.Aroma:This actually smells like fresh brewed coffee. Again, this surprises me.Overall:I'm really impressed by the quality of this product. Regarding my own biases, I usually brew my own coffee using fresh ground beans in a Chemex or a pour-over. This won't give you the same quality as that sort of process (obviously), but I would stack this above other cold coffee canned drinks I've had. The illy issimo provides a surprisingly rich taste, a satisfying dark color and density, and an fine aroma. Altogether, I am very pleased with this cold coffee. Still, it's hard for me to give it a ""five"" (call me a coffee snob if you will); a five would need to reproduce what I do myself very well (or better). Still, this is better than other coffee drinks I've had and I would buy it before the green mermaid or the orange and pink donut shop any day.

B003GTR8IO,delicious,How is the coffee?,"As a die-hard Starbucks fanatic, I feel like its wrong to add flavorings to coffee.  This is the 3rd (and final) vanilla coffee I've tried over the last several months.  Ready for something new and different, vanilla seems a natural addition to coffee so it sounded worth trying.  This is definitely the best of the 3, (see my other reviews) for 2 primary reasons:  the coffee is better, and the vanilla is more subtle.Made in a French press, according to the proportions advised on the side of the bag, Starbucks Natural Fusions produces a medium bold brew with a subtle, but not too sweet vanilla undertone.  The smell of vanilla is most pronounced upon opening the sealed foil bag.  After brewing, it is fairly subtle.  The coffee is smooth and not as acidic as some bolder brews I know and love.  The vanilla is enjoyable due to its lack of sweetness.Overall, a fine cup of coffee, most suitable for drinking with dessert after dinner.  It has been my morning brew for a couple weeks, and I'm ready to return to Sumatra blend.  But for those who enjoy a flavored coffee, this one is highly recommended.

B007N04AF6,small,How is the portion size?,"Quaker Real Medleys Oatmeal is a single-serving container that you add hot water to and eat. It's easy to make, and has generally healthy ingredients.A container provides about 2 1/2 ounces of food. The base component is oatmeal, and they add in almonds, pistachios, and cherries. Note that this means the flavor will be a bit sour, from the cherries. Some people are OK with this. Others won't enjoy it. So this is definitely something you should try first before you buy a twelve pack of it. It might be perfect for you - or the flavor might not be one you enjoy.We did like the flavor, and we liked the fresh ingredients. But, that being said, the price on Amazon is over $2 a serving, which is fairly expensive. ""Regular"" oatmeal can be 50 cents a packet or even less. You could easily customize that oatmeal to be exactly the way you want.But of course, many people are so pressed for time that they only have coffee for breakfast. That is REALLY unhealthy. Many studies show that you should start the day with a meal of some sort, to give your body the nutrients it needs to metabolize properly until lunch. So if you're currently eating nothing at all, and a better breakfast just isn't possible with your schedule, then at least this instant-eat meal is a better solution.Nutrition wise, again this isn't great but it's certainly better than what many people eat (or don't eat) for breakfast. 290 calories, 8g fat, 180mg sodium, and a whopping 49g of carbs. Sure, 5g of that is fiber, but a large 19g of that is sugar. That's a lot of sugar to be pouring into your mouth the first thing in the day. You also get 9g protein. In terms of vitamins, you barely get anything.So overall I'd always suggest eating something HEALTHY for breakfast. Something with protein, nutrition, and what your body actually needs to get its muscles and blood working properly. Something with vitamin and minerals. So I do consider this a step up from many options - but I also consider it a stepping stone to help you get to a place where you eat a fresh meal, vs a sweetened, processed option.I was provided a review set of this from the Amazon Vine program.

Upon opening the bag and brewing my first cup, I knew that Starbucks had a winner here.I like my coffee strong; perhaps this comes from drinking it daily. In any event I found that the vanilla flavored Natural Fusions coffee produced a strong (but not bitter) cup of coffee. The vanilla is a nice balance to the bold Starbucks coffee and makes this a good coffee to drink both iced and hot. One thing I did notice, which I did not like, was a sweet aftertaste.

B004K0630M,low,What is the quality of sugar?,"I was pleasantly surprised with the great strawberry/banana flavor of this drink.  It was fizzy, like soda, which was also unexpected but great- I thought it would be more of a fruit juice.  My kids were clamoring for a taste, so I let them each have a sip.  Both kids enjoyed it.  At 22 carbs per can (serving), it has less sugar than most fruit juices.... however, I wouldn't let kids have any sort of energy drink on a regular basis.While I can't really say that I felt a huge increase in energy level, I am happy to say that I didn't experience any kind of crash after drinking it.I received my can of Jamba's All Natural Energy Drink for free in return for posting my honest review as a part of the Amazon Vine reviewer program.

B004LA1LKI,delicious,What flavoured lollipops are available in this pack and are these ones good in every flavour?,"Ritz Crackerfuls provide a decent, relatively healthy alternative for snack time. One package is a serving, and each package has two multigrain crackers with cheese spread sandwiched between them. First impressions after a few bites into my (broken) crackerful was that the taste was rather bland - the multigrain crackers didn't have much flavor to them and the cheese spread tastes only slightly better than the cheese goo you'd find in dollar store cheese-filled crackers. That said, these are definitely better quality, and better for you, than other similar options. There are no trans fats or MSG, and each serving has 8 grams of whole grain and 5 grams of fiber. While the flavor most likely will not excite your taste buds, these may still provide a worthwhile snack option to consider for young and old alike.

B001LG945O,not sweet,How is it the drink?,"This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda.  While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.Not recommended, sorry. ANSWERNOTFOUND",natural,"(28, 35)"

B001FA1SSM,good,How is the crunch?,"Before this, I had never eaten (and purposely veered away from) cereal with dried fruits in them.  This stuff has changed my mind.  With strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries mixed in, they provide an excellent burst of flavor.But they are by no means the only flavor: just the flakes have a honey-and-vanilla flavor to them, so even eating those alone (how I started eating it) was still very tasty.Word of warning, however:  make sure your teeth can handle this stuff.  The flavor is absolutely delicious, but the texture of the flakes have the same rigidity and CRUNCH of the original ""Grape Nuts.""  (Of course, ""Grape Nuts"" had no flavor except whatever cardboard flavor they managed to leech from the box they were in, but that's another story.)Basically, if somebody is talking to you while you're enjoying a mouthful of this cereal, you won't be able to hear them over the crunching - but you won't care much, because you'll be savoring the flavor and not paying attention to them anyway.

B004DIR3TQ,better,Is the best chocolate on the world?,"Oh bliss, mmm, oh, mmm, oh, excuse me!  Was I talking with my mouth full? I have received a package of Scharffen Berger Semisweet Chocolate in the mail to review, and it is both my favorite type of eating and baking chocolate (of most brands).The Scharffen Berger does not disappoint. It bakes beautifully when chopped into chunks and used in my go-to cookie and scone recipes. The chocolate has lovely gooey melty flops when you bite into the chunks (I'm eating a cookie right now), and the chocolate is a glorious, subtle, hits-you-slowly essence. It's the sophisticated version of Mom's cookies. In scones, the chocolate is perfect with raspberry jam.I'd happily make my Death By Chocolate Cake  - or any other pure chocolate recipe - with these stellar bars. They really have an after dinner quality to them.So why am I eating the other half of a leftover bar in the afternoon?

B008I1XLDQ,good,What do you think about variety?,"When I first got my Keurig, I tried a couple of different ""samplers"" that included selections from several different coffee companies, including Brooklyn Beans.  They were OK, but none really stood out as a ""favorite.""  So when I was offered the opportunity to try a bunch of different varieties from Brooklyn Beans, I decided to give it a shot.  VERY glad I did!First, coffee is definitely a personal taste kind of thing.  I really don't like the bitter over-roasted ""charred"" flavor of some (sorry, Starbucks), but I do like a lot of flavor.  Some folks love that ""dark roasted"" bitter flavor, but I'm not one of them.  Give me a decent rich full-bodied medium roast, and I'm one happy camper.Second, I like both ""plain"" and flavored coffees.  I'm particularly partial to cinnamon, but also like hazelnut, caramel, even blueberry.  Really, I'm game for just about anything.OK, so about this selection:  You get a LOT of different flavors, and you get 2-3 cups per flavor.  So far, I've tried 5 different flavors (Columbian, Fuhgeddaboutit, cinnamon, Boardwalk Blend, and Hazelnut).  Frankly, I've liked all of them.  I usually stay away from ""dark roast,"" but Fuhgeddaboutit was really nice -- definitely a ""dark"" roast, but without that overpowering bitterness I usually find so offensive.  I wouldn't say it's a new favorite, but it's definitely one I could drink again.  Of this group, so far I'd have to say Boardwalk Blend is my favorite -- but I still have several other flavors to try, so I may change my mind.Really, this would be a good ""trial"" package to test out the different flavors available from Brooklyn Beans.  I can honestly say that I was impressed by this, and will likely purchase this variety pack when I run out.  I like having a lot of different choices -- makes life interesting!

They were ""OK"" at best to me but nothing I'd ever go out of my way to pick up. These things on the other hand are another story.Package:The bag is resealable and the thins sit in a plastic tray. So that's a big plus. It's also bright and will stand out in your cabinet. I doubt that you'll lose sight of these with all the other cookies and what not that you may have.The Thins:They are thin of course and break easy but not into a bunch of little pieces like a Nature Valley bar will. The flavor is fantastic. I like cranberries and I like all citrus fruits (orange being the case here) so the two together in this oaty cookie thin are delicious. I don't find the flavor to be overwhelming either. Everything is baked into harmony so each thin tastes as good as the last.I don't pay too much attention to nutrition facts but I know that they are healthier than your typical cookie.

B000FEH8ME,more,How is the ingredient?,"Uhg!  I ate this for breakfast with an apple & my stomach is already growling and it's only been like an hour.  I guess this would make a good snack bar, but the calories are kinda high for a snack (190).Compared to the blueberry Pure bar, this has more flavor.  Unfortunately neither bar is filling.  The cherry bar has a nice tart cherry taste.  Those of you looking for something sickly sweet, you will not find it here despite the Agave ""nectar"" (high fructose sugar stuff) that is in it.  If it wasn't for the high fructose agave syrup (they like to make it sound oh so healthy by calling it agave nectar), I would rate this bar a star higher.  I am on a mission to find agave free organic Vegan bars aside from Lara bars & haven't had any sucess.  It is so disappointing that the health food industry has jumped on the cheap sweet Agave rather than something else, like organic maple syrup or untreated organic sugar?  Organic maple syrup is delish, but oops expensive, so I guess I wont be seeing it in any Vegan bars anytime soon.Now if you think I'm a loon because of the Agave thing, go ahead & research it.  That's all I have to say.Anyway, if you are not concerned about agave or not looking for something to keep you from being hungry then this is a pretty tasty tart treat.

The texture is a little odd, as they are basically dried apples chopped into tiny pieces and then melded into small balls with apple juice and potato starch and a bit of cinnamon.I was surprised at how fitting they were, with one serving feeling sufficient unlike other snacks on the market in which one serving is a joke. It must have been the high fiber content - love a snack that can make me full!

B004YV80O4,tasty,Does the meal tasty?,"First, I have to say that when I got this product, my kids were quite excited.  They love anything with cheese in it so that was a plus from the beginning.  The directions are easy and you can substitute different meats for the chicken breast, which--besides 2 1/2 cups of water--is the only thing not included in the box.  I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say ""simmer & stir often"", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.  It is hard to see and it does not have that lovely green look like it does in the picture.  I'd really just call it the Cheesy Chicken Skillet dinner and not even include the broccoli.Flavor was decent, although a little salty if you eat more than a servings-worth.  The kids loved it, of course...it's CHEESY!  It wasn't bad for my taste buds either.  I was thinking that if I make this again, I might just add my own fresh broccoli florets near the end instead of the freeze-dried packet.The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit was a hit with the kids...I'd just leave the word ""broccoli"" out of it.

It has chunkier bits of nuts and fruit than the LaraBar also.This Blueberry bar is my second flavor to try (I tried the Cherry flavor first)and it is delicious! There are actual dried whole blueberries in the bar which give it a nice sweetness and very real blueberry flavor. In my experience, blueberry flavored anything can usually have a fake or chemically kind of taste but this does not at all.I highly recommend this bar!...and an extra bonus: Both my 4 and 2 year old LOVED this bar, as did my 19 yr old brother so pack these puppies as a healthy snack for your kids!

To my surprise I actually like it. I like blackberry and vanilla but I couldn't imagine them together in tea. The blackberry is smooth and not overpowering and I really don't notice the vanilla flavor much if at all maybe just a slight hint. I was recently sick with a sore throat and this hot tea felt good on my throat and the aroma awakens the senses. I see that they have many different flavors of this tea and I look forward to trying more varieties. ANSWERNOTFOUND,Each tea bag will easily brew 12 oz,"(246, 281)"
B004DIR3TQ,not sweet,Is a delicious chocolate?,"I love dark chocolate, but I think my tastes are a little too pedestrian because this chocolate was just too bitter and not sweet enough for me. I am familiar with cacao percentages and usually prefer my dark chocolate in the 60-ish percent range, though I will eat up to 70 percent occasionally, and this confirmed my belief that more isn't necessarily better when it comes to chocolate percentages.This chocolate clocks in between a bittersweet of 70 and unsweetened at 99, so it was really hard to know what to do with it. I tasted it straight from the bar, and it is very, very dark with hardly any sweetness at all. It was bitter but not overly harsh. It's obviously good quality chocolate so I can't fault them for that, I simply prefer something a little sweeter. I can't see myself craving a piece of this to eat. I don't even think I would eat it for health purposes.I went to Scharffen Berger's website to see if there were any recipes for this chocolate, but all I could find was one for lace sandwich cookies (with the chocolate in the middle) and a pecan tart. They did suggest pairing this chocolate with marshmallow to make s'mores, so that is what I did. The chocolate melts beautifully and had a smooth taste that went well with the sweet marshmallows and graham crackers, but honestly I still think I prefer a lower percentage chocolate.So, if you are a big fan of ""more is better"" when it comes to chocolate percentages, and like your chocolate on the extra dark and bitter side, this is a fine choice. But if, like me, you prefer a slightly more sweet taste without compromising the richness of a bittersweet flavor, you might do better off trying one of their lower percentage chocolates like the 70 or 62%.

I'm not kidding - the cheese-like-substance isn't strong enough to hold the crackers together.  As I pressed down (very lightly) on one end, the whole thing flipped open.  I had to squish it down to keep it together.Taste: It tastes just like you'd expect: it tastes like the american cheese-whiz stuff on ""wheat"" crackers that have that grainy texture to them.  They're not terrible - but I wouldn't say they're good.  I had one as a snack, and was hungry shortly afterwards.  I would have originally thought maybe I can take these golfing which I like to do with things like this - but they don't taste that good, and they don't hold you over for very long.* I have no idea why the RITZ logo is on these.  RITZ crackers are utterly distinctive in their own right.  They have a specific taste and texture unlike any other cracker made in America.  These things are nothing like a RITZ product, and I have no idea why they would associate the RITZ brand with some pseudo-cheese product on wheat-ish cracker boards.-So, yeah, I didn't really like them.  They don't look like they're marketed towards kids - but they sure do not taste like anything a grown-up would want. ANSWERNOTFOUND",crackers that have that grainy texture to them,"(1090, 1136)"
B002IEVJRY,odd,What is an aftertaste?,"The ""illy issimo caffe"" Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink is delicious and remarkably non-acidic. I drank a swallow of the caffe at room temperature and could taste the espresso flavor without the bitter aftertaste. After heating it, the dark thick texture and rich aroma were very pleasing. The caffe is sweetened with 10g of sugar per 6.8 FL OZ can, so no additional sweetener is needed. If you have a sensitive stomach, you will like the low acidity maintained by the potassium bicarbonate additive. It is very smooth to swallow and does not irritate the stomach like many espresso products. Low acidity often comes with a reduction in caffeine, but each can of this caffe has 155 mg of the stimulant (about the same as regular brewed coffee with a shot of espresso).  I am definitely going to order a case of the caffe through Amazon at the reasonable price point (a little less than $2 per can). ANSWERNOTFOUND",the bitter aftertaste,"(195, 216)"

It did absolutely nothing to even try to blow my socks off, and the asking price is too high for it to be so mediocre. This water didn't come from some rare source so the price tag is unwarranted. So why the 4 stars? Because it tastes like good water, as it's supposed to. If it were sold for the same price as Sam's Club water then I'd buy it.

You can definitely taste the apple, although I tasted no cinnamon at all (and I ate almost the whole bag to myself).The ingredients list organic apples, organic apple juice concentrate, organic potato starch and organic cinnamon. Interestingly, the ingredients list was placed on a sticker on the back of my bag--I wanted to see what it was covering up, so I peeled it off. It was covering the original ingredients list on the bag itself, which was the same except for not listing the potato starch and cinnamon as organic. So I don't know if that was just an oversight when the bags were printed, or if they had a change of heart and decided to use all organic ingredients instead of just organic apples and apple juice.There are 14 grams of carbs in a serving, and given that I pretty much ate the entire bag (supposedly 4 servings) the serving size is extremely small. You only get 2.1 ounces of clusters in a bag, which is a small amount considering the price. As I said, I found them to be a pleasant organic snack, but I don't know if I would purchase them again because of the price, and the fact that they're not as good for you as some other dried apple snacks I've eaten.

B0041CIR62,grainy,What can you observe with the texture?,"The first time I tried this brown rice vermicelli I was less than impressed.  It has such a fine texture and I cooked it like I would regular flour pasta in water.  I thought it was tastless and not good.  The next time I prepared it I read the package which tells you to soak it in room temp water for a minute or so before cooking.  It also has a couple of recipe ideas.  I soaked the pasta for a minute (or 3) and it didn't really seem to soften it any but I'm sure it must have helped.  Then, based on the recipes provided, I put it in a large skillet with some Asian and basalmic oil and stirred it around.  It wasn't softening as quickly I I thought so I added a little water and put a lid on it for just a minute.  Perfect!  It came out soft and had absorbed the flavors beautifully.  It made a great addition to my Asian grilled Redfish.  The texture was smooth and soft, not gritty nor gummy.  I'd recommend this product to my friends who are alergic to gluten as well as those who want a healthier alternative to pasta. ANSWERNOTFOUND",such a fine texture,"(85, 104)"
B0026ZYZ7Q,beautiful,Is it a nice colors the tazo teas?,"To me this tea was fine, nothing special, although perhaps this teabag version is not representative of traditional Puerh tea.  I was interested in trying Puerh because I had recently heard an interview about ""China's Dark Teas"" on The Splendid Table (google-able). I tried both the ginger and cardamom flavors.Traditional puerh comes in cakes or loose leaves, and is supposed to be ""rinsed"" for 10-20 seconds in hot water to remove impurities and start the tea opening.  Then steeped for about 30 seconds per cup (and the leaves can be re-steeped in more cups).  [Find out more about traditional puerh on the TeaSource page for puerh.]In contrast, the instructions on the package of teabags just say to steep for 3-5 minutes.  Does this tea have some sort of pre-processing that eliminates the traditional rinsing, or did they just used boiler plate instructions? -- the box doesn't say.  However, I didn't detect any major difference in the flavor of the rinsing water (15 seconds) and the cup of tea steeped for 3 minutes, so it doesn't seem that this tea needs the traditional pre-steeping.  The color was quite dark, but the flavor was much more mellow than some other plain black tea brewed to the same darkness.Of the two teas, the cardamom flavor was nice, but the ginger flavor was pretty minimal.  Without the spice, the 3-minute steeps would be too weak for my taste, lacking the fragrance and depth of, say, a good English Breakfast tea, but the cardamom rounded out the overall flavor.  So I would recommend getting the cardamom flavor rather than ginger.I steeped a second cup of each flavor after the first, for 2 minutes, and while the second cup of each was weaker, the spice flavor was a bit stronger in proportion, especially the ginger.  So to get relatively more spice flavor, you might need to steep for the full 5 minutes.  The second cup from the same teabag was sufficiently weaker that it doesn't seem like you could get many cups out of it, as described on the TeaSource page for traditional puerh tea. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The color was quite dark,"(1096, 1120)"
B0034EDLS2,perfect,Where is the bar?,"This flavor has an overwhelming peanut, i.e. peanut butter flavor with a tart, fruity flavor reminding me of a PB&J sandwich.  I didn't enjoy it but that may be because I don't like peanut butter.  Too many peanuts (""nuts"" to me doesn't mean a majority of peanuts) and too tart of fruit, too pasty texture of fruit as well as too much of it.  I prefer nutty with no peanuts and chewy, sweeter fruit pieces.  My bars were fresh and chewy (a tad on the soft side).

B00934WBRO,not good,How is the quality of the taste?,"At first glance I thought this would be a nice snack for the day made out of real apples and only 60 calories are great.  However the 2.1 ounce bag has four servings in it making the actual bag 240 calories which isn't bad, but isn't exactly great.  Each serving is basically sugar with a bit of fiber (10 grams of sugar and 2 grams of fiber with no fat or protein).  The taste was extremely sweet - no added sugar, but using apple juice concentrate has the same effect .  The crunch was extreme and reminded me of malted balls.  It wasn't terribly pleasant given the large size of the spheres.While this may be better than pure candy, for the calories and the amount of sugar you might as well just grab for some chocolate.

B007N04AF6,small,How is the portion size?,"Quaker Real Medleys Oatmeal is a single-serving container that you add hot water to and eat. It's easy to make, and has generally healthy ingredients.A container provides about 2 1/2 ounces of food. The base component is oatmeal, and they add in almonds, pistachios, and cherries. Note that this means the flavor will be a bit sour, from the cherries. Some people are OK with this. Others won't enjoy it. So this is definitely something you should try first before you buy a twelve pack of it. It might be perfect for you - or the flavor might not be one you enjoy.We did like the flavor, and we liked the fresh ingredients. But, that being said, the price on Amazon is over $2 a serving, which is fairly expensive. ""Regular"" oatmeal can be 50 cents a packet or even less. You could easily customize that oatmeal to be exactly the way you want.But of course, many people are so pressed for time that they only have coffee for breakfast. That is REALLY unhealthy. Many studies show that you should start the day with a meal of some sort, to give your body the nutrients it needs to metabolize properly until lunch. So if you're currently eating nothing at all, and a better breakfast just isn't possible with your schedule, then at least this instant-eat meal is a better solution.Nutrition wise, again this isn't great but it's certainly better than what many people eat (or don't eat) for breakfast. 290 calories, 8g fat, 180mg sodium, and a whopping 49g of carbs. Sure, 5g of that is fiber, but a large 19g of that is sugar. That's a lot of sugar to be pouring into your mouth the first thing in the day. You also get 9g protein. In terms of vitamins, you barely get anything.So overall I'd always suggest eating something HEALTHY for breakfast. Something with protein, nutrition, and what your body actually needs to get its muscles and blood working properly. Something with vitamin and minerals. So I do consider this a step up from many options - but I also consider it a stepping stone to help you get to a place where you eat a fresh meal, vs a sweetened, processed option.I was provided a review set of this from the Amazon Vine program.

B003GTR8IO,good,What is the quality of the blend?,"For me, half the pleasure of a good cup of coffee is the aroma while it's brewing. Since I love the scent of anything ""vanilla,"" I decided to tryStarbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2). With this special blend, Starbucks promises ""a subtle flavor and pleasant aroma.""I looked forward to having it before breakfast yesterday, so was pleasantly surprised to wake up to a most delightful vanilla bouquet. That flavor called out to me, so I followed my nose straight to the kitchen where my friend Lynn was quietly reading the newspaper and sipping a cup. She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say ""Thanks,"" she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch! She knows I generally add different flavors of creamer to my coffee, too, but I had wanted to test the ""subtleness"" promised in the ad--without any additives. Anyway, it was delicious with the creamer and I was pleased with the product.My true test of this natural fusions blend came this morning when I indulged myself by trying it a la naturale... Oh, my! What a taste treat! ""Wow,"" I thought, ""this is real coffee!"" The vanilla was just the right amount to blend with the other natural flavors for a perfect cup of coffee. It pleases my palate as well as my olfactory senses... Can't beat that!As an additional test, I brewed a pot for another friend who generally enjoys stronger coffee. Although he liked it, he said it wasn't strong enough for him. So, if you like very strong coffee, this might not be the blend for you...or perhaps I should have added more coffee per cup. But then that would have been for him, not for me. And just how far should I go for a friend? Hmmmm...I have the open bag of coffee beside me as I type this review.

B001LG940E,refreshing,How is drink?,"This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice caoncentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.As to taste:  I was expecting ""Black Cherry"" in a dark red can to be strong.  This was mellow.  I could taste the cherry juice, but I think apple was the dominant flavor.  This tasted remarkably like a children's juice box or a capri sun baggie, probably because it's a mix of juices in which apple is prominent.  It tasted like real juice - not fake.The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.  At home, purchasing fruit juice in a bottle and seltzer water in a bottle and mixing them in a glass provides more options and a taste of carbonated fruit juice.  I used to do lots of carbonated fruit juice mixes, and think I prefer plain apple juice and seltzer water to this, mostly because the Switch flavor didn't strike me.  Which juice sits best with you will be a matter of taste, and if you like carbonated fruit juice, then this could be a way to make it portable for bag lunches, road trips, and such.Overall, if you drink a lot of sodas and like fruit juice, this is worth a try, perhaps in the form of one can on a road trip.  It's healthier than soda, because it has real sugar (from fruit, not added) instead of high fructose corn syrup, but not as healthy as a piece of fruit.Oh, yes, here is the nutritional information:8.3 oz.,  130 calories, 0g fat, 15mg sodium, 35g total carb, 33g sugar, 0g protein, 100% of vitamin C.Ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (Vitamin C) ANSWERNOTFOUND",Switch lives up to that claim,"(83, 112)"

It is slightly smaller than the Starbucks Frappacino but it also has fewer calories I don't know if the smaller size to smaller calorie ratio is the same though- it didn't matter that much to me.  Also the can opening vs the wide mouth Starbucks Frappacino was a nice.The dark coffee fan thought it was a little to sugary for him, so if you are big into dark coffee or like bitter coffees this one is not going to be for you.

B005HG9ERW,refresh,Does it have a strong taste?,"Firstly, I am picky with water. I do not like Aquafina or Dasani because I think they taste like the plastic bottle. My favorite waters are Deer Park and Poland Spring. Both have a clean, crisp flavor, with no funky after taste or odd plastic taste.Essentia has a nice clean, fresh taste. Just pure clean water. No after taste, no odd tastes overall. I love the bigger sized bottle. I cannot attest to the benefits of drinking pH water specifically because I only tried the one bottle and of course did not see any benefits or notice anything spectacularly different from any other water.I suppose if you have great interest in the long term benefits of drinking Essentia with its 9.5pH and if you do not mind the price, it is worth it. I myself cannot see spending so much on bottled water, although it does have a very good, pure taste. ANSWERNOTFOUND",crisp flavor,"(188, 200)"
B001D0GV4K,fine,Is coffee good?,"This coffee is fairly bold, but not bitter. It has a brightness, that comes though the creamer and sweeteners that I use. There is a bit of lingering aftertaste, so that is why only four (4) stars.  I will order it again, especially at the price  paid through Amazon. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This coffee is fairly bold,"(0, 26)"
B0051COPFI,fantastic,How delicious is the taste of coffee?,The only reason this gets four stars and not five is because it is a little messy.  A six month old or even a year old will be able to suck and swallow this product.  The straw is short so when it pops out of their mouth it becomes a pear explosion if it is still being squeezed.  The product tastes good.  It has a flavor that tastes natural and does not feel as if there has been the toxic sweet additives that are in most products.  The resealable cap is beautiful.  It is also thick enough that you can squeeze the small remainder of the product at the bottom of the pouch onto a spoon to avoid any waste.  I would recommend buying this product. ANSWERNOTFOUND,It has a flavor that tastes natural,"(307, 342)"
B002D4DY8G,delicious,How is the coffee?,"I brewed the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee both in a Cuisinart automatic brew coffee maker and a french press. I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the coffee does n't taste good,"(1778, 1807)"
B004BKHX1Y,dry,How is the cracker?,"These crackers are delicious!  They're good with milk, with fruit, or even all by themselves.

I love how sweet it is.  I am not a fan of dry-barely-sweet granola but the gooey sugary stuff marketed toward children isn't great either (I'd rather eat a cookie or cake).  This hits that midpoint that is perfect when craving a sweet snack (without going for a full-fledged dessert).  The chocolate is perfect and sweet without being bitter like found in many healthier snacks.Nice perk... the zipper closure at the top.

B005IW4WEA,different,How is the consistency of the appetizer?,"This is my first experience with any sort of healthy grain snack. I have to say, I've become a fan. I find it difficult to enjoy healthier options because I do have such a sweet tooth but with the vanilla and the blueberry mixed in with these grains I don't miss the sugar. Plus, it helps to know that this snack is very healthy, not to mention quite tasty. When I think of healthy I don't usually think it will taste good as well.I've actually been looking for ways to add some sort of Omega-3 into my diet but it's been difficult because I don't like fish. This snack is full of flax seed which is full of the heart healthy Omega-3.When I first received the bag I thought, this reminds me of cereal. While reading the back label it actually say's you can add milk and have it just that way. I've yet to do that because I brought this product into work to have as a breakfast filler. It works perfectly for that as helps control your appetite. It fills me up and I feel good knowing it's a healthier option than what I'd usually go for.For me I'm so happy I found this product. Its low in sugar, full of Omega-3, and is made with 100% whole grains. They suggest trying this on top of yogurt or with milk. Both seem like delicious ideas that I can't wait to try.I am pleasantly surprised I like this. I'll definitely be getting it again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this reminds me of cereal,"(675, 700)"
B000FEH8ME,nutty,How is the taste?,"This bar was actually not as terrible as I thought it would be - I had tried another all natural fruit bar recently that tasted like a compost pile, so this was actually refreshing.  It should be called ""Pure Bar Organic Wild DATE"" because it tastes and has a texture like dried dates (which is fine, I like dried dates) with a hint of blueberry.  It does smell blueberry-ish though.  The first few bites were really good and I kept thinking that it reminded me of eating a fruit roll up... but maybe having 70 of them smashed together and eating it in one bite... a kids dream.  I didn't like the nuts in the bar.  I probably would have preferred it if it was a fruit only bar, for some reason the nuts threw me off and I got about half way through and lost interest.  My husband had a few bites and also had a similar reaction.Not sure how much energy I'd derive from it compared to other food bars, but even as a processed packaged food, it tastes light years better than most of the other bars I've tried.

B000FFIEL2,delicious,How is the soup?,"I picked up the black bean and lime soup at whole foods, wanted to try one before committing to six. It's very convenient with two options, either put warm water in, stir, and microwave, or add boiling water, stir, cover for six minutes. This is great if you have a keurig or hot water source at work, or if you just have room temp water from a water bottle. Stirring is important, dig all the way down to the bottom or you'll have dry spots the water doesn't penetrate.I like spicy food and the packet delivered. After six minutes the soup was a lovely texture, soft but not mushy.  I did not pick up lime, but this soup was flavorful and filling, Perfect for work or home.

B005VOOKMY,weak,Is coffee poor or is it the way to prepare it?,"I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roastCoffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)is the best, followed by equal exchangeEqual Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct. (None as good as Green Mountain, Trader Joes, or several small roasters).It is too bad.  I would like to see companies like this one become successful, as they are doing a lot of good things in the world and their community.  but, in all honesty, this particular coffee is not very good.

B00503DOWS,great,How is the bar?,"The top part of the wrapper advertises, ""Wheat-Free, Gluten-Free, Non-Dairy"" and that it's good whenever. In the spirit of whenever I decided to try a bar as my breakfast; the question I had was would one bar provide sufficient nutrition to carry me to lunch without getting hungry mid-morning. I can report that it did just that; I didn't even think about food until after 12 PM. So I would count that as a success.In all fairness I must admit that my lifestyle that morning was much less than vigorous and active and one who is engaging in an active lifestyle with much physical exertion will probably need to supplement one bar.The bar is rather soft and chewy and has a fruity flavor that reminded me of dates; I checked and there are no dates listed so I'm not sure what I tasted. The list of ingredients starts with Gluten-Free Oats with Organic Agave as the second ingredient; the agave is also known as the Century Plant. The third ingredient is a rice blend which includes some rice flours, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum. Walnuts were pretty far down the list and I don't recall encountering any chunks of walnuts. There was, however, a warning for people with allergies that the product was processed on equipment that makes other products that use peanuts and other tree nuts, soy and milk.From a nutritional perspective each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat, 15 mg of cholesterol, 140 mg of sodium, 2 grams of dietary fiber, and 2 grams of protein.I enjoyed my bar with a cup of coffee and found it sustained me all morning. It is not a cookie or a particularly sweet treat but it is a tasty and convenient food. The package is easy to open if you pinch the wrapper on the front and back and pull it apart.

If I was well off, I would drink one every afternoon instead of some other caffeinated drink.Anyway I do like Jamba Juice so I had high hopes.  This tasted pleasant enough for energy drink standards and what I mean by that is that it didn't make me gag.

I wish there were a bit more berries but it's not really an issue.  Also the box is a bit small.  I think with an average-size bowl,  I can get at the most 4 servings out of the box.

Where Reese's peanut butter filling is almost dry and crumbly, this is thick and viscous. You won't have to worry about getting &#34;Butterfinger teeth&#34; because there isn't enough of that crunchy stuff to glom up in your teeth. It also isn't as intensely peanut butter-y tasting, which is to be expected given that it should taste more like a Butterfinger.I like to freeze these cream-filled candies because the flavor often intensifies when frozen, but the opposite was true with the Butterfingers. The flavor straight out of the box is mild but notable, and doesn't have that somewhat salty strength that Reese's does.

B001FA1SSM,fresh,How is cereal?,"Honestly, when I read ""100% organic"" and ""multi-grain,"" I had already decided that the cereal would probably taste like cardboard, with some berries added.In reality, this was a pretty tasty cereal that was full of flavor.  It has whole-grain flakes that are made with brown sugar, and you can really taste the sugar.  This was a pleasant surprise.  The flakes are VERY hard, though...some might call it ""crunchy,"" but to me, it was unusual to have a flake that was resistant to being chewed!  This took a little getting used to...but at least the flake is tasty.There are also little bits of barley in the cereal, and this adds a nice psychological touch.  You see those, and the cereal just SEEMS healthier.  I didn't really notice the taste or texture of them...but it was nice to know they were there.And there are lots of berries.  Strawberries, raspberries and supposedly some blackberries, although I'm not sure I saw any.  I've had other cereals with dehydrated berries...these seemsed a little more resistant to re-hydrating than I'm used to, but they were still tasty.There are certainly sweeter cereals around, but this one is pretty sweet nonetheless.  They worked hard to counteract the ""cardboard"" stigma.  So if you are a person who really doesn't appreciate sweet cereal, I would not recommend this.  If, however, you're somewhat like me and prefer a sweetness in your breakfast cereals, but also want to feel like you're eating something a little healthier (it does have 5G of fiber per serving)...I think Back To Nature Summer Berry Blend would be a pretty good choice.

B000FEH8ME,not bad,What about the calorie?,"I'm not an expert on fruit and nut bars or energy bars, but I have eaten a fair number of them over time.  With that preface, I like this bar.  It has a nice consistency, chewy with plenty of nuts.  It has a smooth blueberry flavor surrounding the various nut flavors.  The texture is pleasing.  I thought it was particularly good with coffee.I also thought the ingredients and nutritional data listed on the wrapper looked appealing.  Essentially every ingredient is labeled organic and the fat types are, I believe, ""better"" fats.  I wouldn't mind if calories were lower, but I don't think they're out of line for this type product. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I would n't mind if calories were lower,"(534, 572)"

It would be great with any type of meat, I personally tried it on chicken. The first time around I marinated the chicken in the sauce and then threw it on the grill. The second time I just made some holes in the chicken with a fork, poured the sauce over it, and stuck it in the oven. Either way, the chicken came out very good. If you like a raspberry vinaigrette type dressing, this sauce would work well as a dressing too. I highly recommend this chipotle sauce, you will not be disappointed!

B002D4DY8G,rich,How was the chocolate taste?,"Our family isn't a big fan of flavored coffee beans. I feel they usually have a very artificial taste, and sometimes leave a strange bitter after-effect.Needless to say, our first morning trying this Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee we weren't expecting anything special, but we were pleasantly surprised. The chocolate flavor is full and rich, in fact a almost too rich! Making a full cup of coffee seem a bit too much. This is a flavor to savor, not chug on the way to work.Since then, we've been adding about a tablespoon of the Gevalia to our regular blend in the mornings, and it's amazing this tiny amount adds such richness and flavor to our morning cuppa.Not cheap if used alone, but if you stretch it out by making a blend with cheaper coffee as the base, you'll be thrilled at the wonderful rich flavor. A great way to pamper yourself without breaking the bank! ANSWERNOTFOUND",The chocolate flavor is full and rich,"(311, 348)"

B00934WBRO,strong,How do you like the tooth?,"For those looking for a healthy alternative to snacks available, many find ""Peeled Snacks Organiz Apple Clusters"" to their liking.Inside each bag are small apple clusters that are made of organic apple pieces with cinnamon, rolled into clusters and have a crunch.  About the size of a marble, these clusters are delicious for those who love apples.It's important to note that these are hard crunch (nothing like peanut brittle, but if you have sensitive teeth or a crown, you may not want to chew these).Its ingredients are fairly simple: Organic apples, organic apple juice concentrate, organic potato starch and organic cinnamon and packed in a facility that processes nuts, dairy, wheat and soy.Only 60 calories per serving, 0 grams of protein, fat and trans fat, 0 mg of cholesterol or sodium and total carbs are 14 grams.And unlike potato chips or other crackers in which you feel like getting more and more and can't stop.  Surprisingly, these little clusters are quite filling (I know, another review said they weren't filling but I was unable to finish a bag).Overall, I enjoyed these apple clusters.

I was a little sad that it doesn't have a coconut smell, but it is supposed to be organic and not added junk for scent. So no problems there. It did leave my hair greasy that night...duh! No way you could go out with this on your hair ;)  I left it on all night. The next day I shampooed my hair twice, then used my usual conditioner. WOW Just that first day my hair feels softer and is visibly shinier! I love it!!

B000ED7M2W,full,Does hulled seeds are full of nutrients?,"OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",not important,"(156, 169)"
B0026ZYZ7Q,weak,How is it cup ?,"Now, I don't presume to say that this is a tea for everyone. I don't quite get it, but obviously, considering the reviews, many people don't like it at all. (I gave t-bags to 2 co-workers, after raving about how wonderful this is, and their lack of comment 6 weeks later tells me that they didn't like it, either.) It's up to you whether you want to risk disliking it, or missing out on something truly amazing. (Rule of thumb: If you like pu-erh, you might as well try it; if not, this might not be your best introduction to it.)When I'm having a horrible day, when things have turned sour and the world seems to be against me, this is my cup of comfort, my security blanket. It soothes me, calms me with its sheer deliciousness. (Give a child a big bar of chocolate, and he'll stop sulking in no time. That's my equivalent.)Now, this tea is amazing, but far from perfect. I wish there were twice as much tea in each bag, for starters; this is a bit weak, and I use big mugs. I wish there was more pu-erh than condiments (chocolate nibs, orange pieces) per bag. I wish that it was good for multiple re-steepings, as most pu-erhs are. A few more t-bags per box would be very nice too, or a lower price tag.In fact, these shortcomings annoy me a bit, and I've been looking for other chocolate teas (pu-erh and non-pu-erh) to substitute it. So far they've all failed. It is next to impossible to find *good* chocolate tea; most are terrible. See: I hate rooibos, so that plus chocolate equals ""eeew"". I like black tea, but haven't found a good combination yet. Green tea and chocolate sounds gross; I haven't tried it yet. Same for white and oolong. I've only found another brand of chocolate pu-erh (Mighty Leaf) but the flavor wasn't there.But I found a way to make this perfect: I cut a bag open and mix it with regular pu-erh;Rishi Tea Organic Pu-erh Tuo Cha Loose Tea, 5-Ounce Tin (Pack of 2)or a Camel's Breath tuo cha work beautifully. This way I can steep it 3-4 times, and I get the yummy flavor in a much stronger version. Heavenly!!! ANSWERNOTFOUND",this is my cup of comfort,"(629, 654)"

Plus, he needs things he doesn't have to touch with his hands because he's usually got a lot of dirt on the job site and no access to a kitchen. These bars are a good choice for him because they are lower in calories than a candy bar but have a good amount of nutrition and fiber.The bar is made from dates, cashews, walnuts, rice protein concentrate, blueberries with apple juice concentrate and sunflower oil, agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, and blueberry flavor. It isn't cooked. The bar is 190 calories and contains 3 grams of fiber, 8 grams of fat, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 6 grams of protein. It also has a fair amount of potassium (180 mg), which is supposed to help balance sodium and help to keep blood pressure under control.The texture is dense but not heavy or gritty.

B004JRKEH4,creamy,Does it have good consistency?,"My first thought was that the Taco Bell sauce would be good as a dip.  Since my garden is now producing cucumbers at a scary rate, I tried the sauce as a cucumber salad dressing as soon as I opened the bottle. It worked very well. The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green.  They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna.  This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce.  Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise.  The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce.  I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well.  That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste. The one negative is that they contain artificial coloring and flavoring.  They lose a star on that account.

B0014WYXQK,right,Is the size good?,"This review will be for the Blackberry and Apple flavors of this product.Apple:Several people in my household have tried this flavor and as such there is a wide array of responses to it. One person really like it. Thought it was refreshing, flavorful, and an all around good drink. The opposite end someone thought it was very sour and they didn't like it at all. Me personally, I thought it was okay. For an apple flavor it seemed to taste a lot like a lemon-lime drink versus apple.Blackberry:By and large all of us didn't care nearly as much for this flavor. In fact the person who really liked the Apple flavor thought the Blackberry tasted like a cheap spimonti (sp) wine. I thought this flavor was a little on the tart side and if I am drinking something to be refreshed, tart is not the flavor I would want.I was disappointed in both flavors not tasting like what I expected. For 70% fruit juice I was expecting something that stayed more true to the fruit that was one the front of the can not a mixture of an asortment of different juices.The small cans are perfect for putting in a backpack, cooler etc. and at 90 calories they are relatively healthy as well.All in all, it's not a bad product and I can easily see where others may really like the flavors.

We eat Mexican-ish style dishes quite a bit at home, so it's nice to have a bottled sauce for a little extra kick. I do like the chipotle flavor in this particular sauce, but of course, not everyone has the same tastes. I also liked that it comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip lid with a small hole, rather than having to try to pour it out of the larger opening. That makes it convenient for adding just the amount you want. It can be used as a salad dressing, if you like thick dressings... or as a dipping sauce for tortilla chips, or on tacos, burritos, what-have-you.

These bags are easy and I just put the meat in, add the seasoning packet, shake (move around to evenly cover the chicken breasts and than bake.  The Garlic Parmesan and Italian Herb has a great flavor, the garlic and cheese blend is great on chicken breast (and although not listed, I think it would also be great on pork chops).  The coating leaves a nice flavored baked into the meat (I use skinless chicken breast) and tastes great.In the end the convenience of these are amazing.

The cranberries are tart but they are coated with sugar (salt too?), which intensifies the taste.  Likewise, the apple bits were also sweetened.  The nuts (cashew, almond and pistachio) were good although the pistachios were a bit stale.  This is snack would most likely be enjoyed by someone, who has a sweet tooth and those who like nuts and fruit blends.  All in all, when compared to ""health"" foods of this size, it is very pleasant.  I would definitely carry this in my purse for a quick snack.The downside is that it has added sugar and salt.  One serving has 25g Carbs and 9g of fat (those from the nuts and the added Sunflower Oil).  So, if you watch carbs this is probably higher than other similar sized snacks.  I felt the sugar did enhance the taste but so many packaged foods have to much added sugar and salt in my opinion, probably not the best choice for those who are hypoglycemic, diabetic, or those with cardiac issues.I would use this as a substitute for salad dressings or in combination with oil and vinegar on a salad.

My first reaction to the cherry cashew was ""this tastes like 'health food'""--maybe a good thing to some, but admittedly, I've got a sweet tooth and found the earthy taste rather bland. The cherries do add a tangy kick, but I would have preferred it to balance the tanginess with more sweetness. The texture is chewy and somewhat grainy, with a bit of nutty crunch. What the cherry cashew bar lacks in taste it makes up somewhat in its hearty, satisfying quality. It's organic, vegan, gluten free, and all-natural, making it a healthy snack. It's a great energy pick-me-up, rich in protein (7g), fiber (3g), and a variety of vitamins and minerals (though not incredibly large amounts of these--it's no true substitute for fresh fruit).

When I think of healthy I don't usually think it will taste good as well.I've actually been looking for ways to add some sort of Omega-3 into my diet but it's been difficult because I don't like fish. This snack is full of flax seed which is full of the heart healthy Omega-3.When I first received the bag I thought, this reminds me of cereal. While reading the back label it actually say's you can add milk and have it just that way. I've yet to do that because I brought this product into work to have as a breakfast filler. It works perfectly for that as helps control your appetite. It fills me up and I feel good knowing it's a healthier option than what I'd usually go for.For me I'm so happy I found this product. Its low in sugar, full of Omega-3, and is made with 100% whole grains. They suggest trying this on top of yogurt or with milk. Both seem like delicious ideas that I can't wait to try.I am pleasantly surprised I like this. I'll definitely be getting it again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Its low in sugar,"(1079, 1095)"

B00503DOWS,large,How is the bar?,"Pamela's Gluten Free Whenever Bars are not bad for a quick bite on the go, but may leave you feeling a little unsatisfied and hollow.Oat Raisin Walnut Spice is an ok flavor combo- soft, chewy and pretty tasty, reminds you of oatmeal cookies- but there's more oats than anything else. Wheat free, gluten-free and non-dairy, they're good for a whenever snack- just as advertised. The box indicates there may be traces of soy due to the manufacturing process.The energy boost is a little light, with 24 g carbs per 40 g bar. That's not much better than a piece of fruit.I was a little disappointed in these in that they're a bit on the small side and the product description is misleading: the box only contains five bars, not six. They're ok, but as I said in my other reviewer I'd still take a Clif bar over these. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Bars are not bad for a quick bite on the go,"(30, 73)"

B004K00DGC,low,How is the expectation?,"Jamba All Natural Energy Drink is being sold as a healthier alternative to other caffeinated sodas and ""energy"" drinks. It does have fewer calories. The Jamba drink contains 90 Calories, which is less than the 110 found in Red Bull. The equivalent quantity (8.4 oz) of most non-diet sodas contains about 105 calories. Obviously it has a lot more calories than a diet soda, but it also does not contain artificial sweeteners that some consider unhealthy.The Jamba ingredients described as ""natural"" but it does have added flavorings and sweeteners.I like most Jamba products but this one has a watery flavor. I would describe it as carbonated water with a fruity flavor.Energy drinks are just another way to say caffeinated drinks. This has about 80 mg of caffeine. That is about the same as a can of the popular Red Bull drinks. The same volumes of most sodas have about 25-35mg depending on the brand. A cup of coffee has about 100 - 175 mg of caffeine, depending on the coffee and how it's brewed. If you want some caffeine boost, this may have more that most sodas, but it has far fewer that a typical cup of coffee.If you are looking for a reasonably healthily quick caffeine boost, without a lot of flavor, that you can slam down, this may be the drink for you. If you are looking for something a little more flavorful, look elsewhere. ANSWERNOTFOUND",If you want some caffeine boost this may have more that most sodas,"(1000, 1067)"
B002IEVJRY,not sweet,How is it the drink?,"I love coffee and continue to drink it occasionally even though I have a sensitivity to caffeine these days. It took me THREE mornings to finish this tiny 6.8-ounce can, about 2 ounces a day to where I was feeling that buzz. This stuff is strong. It's billed as a coffee drink, but it really is more of an espresso, so keep that in mind. I appreciated that the caffeine content was listed on the can, 152 mg, which is higher than a lot of coffee, which tends to be 100 to 120 mg per serving.It definitely has a strong coffee taste, with no sweetness at all, not even an artificial sweetener. With only the three ingredients, it's your basic straight-up stuff.

B0014WYXQK,right,Is the size good?,"Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is not too sweet, but it is just as refreshing and fun as sugary soft drinks. The cans are small and stylish, perfect for carrying in your purse or backpack. Kids like it, and the smaller size makes it a more sensible serving.The company is ecologically and socially responsible, too.What's more, this flavor is very nice with a touch of Cointreau for a sophisticated and festive cocktail.An excellent alternative to sodas. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the smaller size makes it a more sensible serving,"(203, 252)"
B004BKLHOS,more,How much fiber do you have?,"The clear selling point of anything labeled ""back to nature"" is going to be its healthier ingredients and the crackers do a good job of stacking up against most popular brands in that area.  They have no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors and no high fructose corn syrup--that alone puts them ahead of the usual in my book, especially the lack of HFCS which is so hard to avoid. They have slightly less sugar (7 g vs 8-10 for other brands), significantly less sodium (130 g vs 200 and up), slightly more fiber, slightly fewer calories (about 15 cal fewer per serving).  So yes, they're certainly better for you.The question of course then goes to taste, a much more subjective aspect.  Personally, I found their taste slightly less rich, which is a negative, but better in two categories. They are noticeably less sweet which I prefer as I'm not a fan of sweet foods; obviously others may have a different view on that.  They are maybe a bit more dry, though it's hard to tell as graham crackers in general seem a bit dry to me.  But they are definitely crispier than the usual other types.We don't go in much for crackers in our house, but on the few occasions we'll do so, I'd certainly pick up these rather than the larger brands due to their healthier ingredients, less sweet taste, and similar overall taste.  A plus as well for their focus on sustainability and recycling ANSWERNOTFOUND",slightly more fiber,"(500, 519)"
B005Y10X9S,delicious,How is the bar?,"I was not terribly impressed with these bars.  I found the taste to be bitter, and highly artificial.  There is a processed and chemical kind of aftertaste.  It does not even taste like chocolate at all.While bars are convenient because they are portable and control portions well, I was really not a fan of this bar.  For the same amount of calories, you can have fresh fruit, vegetables, or nuts, as opposed to this highly processed bar.While these are low carb, as part of the overall South Beach diet, I do not necessarily think these are a good addition to a healthy balanced diet.  They bars are high in sugar.  If looking for a high protein low cal low fat snack, I would opt for greek yogurt instead. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I was really not a fan of this bar,"(282, 316)"
B002NHSQ6I,great,How is the chocolate taste?,"I was excited to try this chocolate as I'm such a fan of Newman's Own products in general.  It was good, but I found it a little disappointing.  It has a rich chocolate taste, but the texture is a bit too dry for just eating (which is what I intended to do with it).  It might work well for baking, but I haven't tried that yet...probably would work to chop up in pieces for cookies. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I found it a little disappointing,"(109, 142)"
B004OVATOI,dense,How about drinks at the bar?,"I'm not a vegan or looking for gluten-free foods, but since this product is labeled as such, I'll take it at its word.  My real interest in this bar is the ""natural"" foods that comprise it.  I can pronounce everything on the label.Pluses:  You can really taste the crunchy peanuts and sweet raisins; they're both packed with ""real"" flavor.  The small bar also has 7g of protein (not nearly as much as a protein bar, but good for a pick-me-up) and 5g of fiber.Minuses:  The bar is very sticky (probably because of the real molasses in it that binds everything together).  It sticks to the wrapper...and then your fingers.  And that's eating it in air-conditioning.  Perhaps popping it into the refrigerator would help?  The small bar is also 200 calories, but at least it's filled with healthy ingredients.  Use it as a snack, not a side item!All in all, it's a tasty treat -- even moreso than a granola bar (and probably a little bit healthier too!). ANSWERNOTFOUND",The bar is very sticky,"(469, 491)"

The caffeine is a plus for me because I recently started a diet and began having horrible headaches only to find out I was having caffeine withdrawals from all the sodas I was drinking, but this caffeinated water helps you get over those caffeine headaches without any extra calories. The water is smooth and refreshing. Great water for people that need that extra jolt without having to consume coffee, tea, energy drinks,or sodas.

B004K0630M,low,What is the quality of sugar?,"I was pleasantly surprised with the great strawberry/banana flavor of this drink.  It was fizzy, like soda, which was also unexpected but great- I thought it would be more of a fruit juice.  My kids were clamoring for a taste, so I let them each have a sip.  Both kids enjoyed it.  At 22 carbs per can (serving), it has less sugar than most fruit juices.... however, I wouldn't let kids have any sort of energy drink on a regular basis.While I can't really say that I felt a huge increase in energy level, I am happy to say that I didn't experience any kind of crash after drinking it.I received my can of Jamba's All Natural Energy Drink for free in return for posting my honest review as a part of the Amazon Vine reviewer program.

B000FEH8ME,enough,Does it have enough sugar?,"I'm always looking for things for the lunch box instead of candy bars. My husband works in construction and he's limited to what he can take for lunch without it going bad on hot days. Plus, he needs things he doesn't have to touch with his hands because he's usually got a lot of dirt on the job site and no access to a kitchen. These bars are a good choice for him because they are lower in calories than a candy bar but have a good amount of nutrition and fiber.The bar is made from dates, cashews, walnuts, rice protein concentrate, blueberries with apple juice concentrate and sunflower oil, agave nectar, almonds, lemon juice concentrate, and blueberry flavor. It isn't cooked. The bar is 190 calories and contains 3 grams of fiber, 8 grams of fat, 26 grams of carbohydrates, and 6 grams of protein. It also has a fair amount of potassium (180 mg), which is supposed to help balance sodium and help to keep blood pressure under control.The texture is dense but not heavy or gritty. It seems a bit less heavy than some other bars I've bought, and it has a good blueberry scent and flavor. The sweetness is about right and doesn't make my mouth feel like I need to brush my teeth. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The sweetness is about right,"(1094, 1122)"
B001LGGH54,nasty,How is the aftertaste?,"I have tried most flavors of Switch and I think Watermelon Strawberry is hands down my most favorite.When you first sip it, the flavor of fresh watermelon (not candy sweet watermelon) is crisp yet light and enhanced by the carbonation, this is quickly followed by a strawberry flavor that can best be described as identical to the strawberry juice at the bottom of the bowl.  Even though this doesn't have added table sugar, the strawberry sweetness (enhanced by other fruit juices) does taste like strawberries with a little bit of sugar sprinkled on them- so the juice at the bottom is sweet but not syrupy thick and sweet...Delicious and carb wise I would use this as a tasty alternative to regular sodas.  Good stuff. ANSWERNOTFOUND",identical to the strawberry juice ANSWERNOTFOUND,"(314, 736)"
B004LA1LKI,great,How was the snack?,"The snack basically consists of 2 high fiber crackers with processed cheese spread between them. The crackers are fine, but the cheese paste tastes like a science experiment instead of real cheese.  I know you can't expect real cheese in a prepackaged, non-refrigerated snack like this one, but there's decent artificial cheese flavor and bad artificial cheese flavor, and this is definitely the latter.  (Also, the box reads ""Natural Flavors with Other Natural Flavors"", which is a pet peeve of mine - it sounds silly.  Just say ""Natural Flavors"" already!  It's like saying ""Rainy with a chance of showers"" in the weather report.)In terms of nutritional information, there's 7 grams of fat per serving, which is high, but 4.5 of those are unsaturated fats, which is more acceptable but still high. On the plus side, 5 grams of fiber per serving is great.The main draw of this product is the convenience of the packaging. Let's be honest: for the same amount of money, you can buy a box of crackers and some REAL cheddar cheese and have a much more natural, less processed, better tasting end result - but you'd have to keep the cheese refrigerated and put the snack together yourself, whereas you can just throw a couple of these pre-made and wrapped packages in your backpack and have a quick snack handy in case your toddler runs out of fuel when you're out and about. For a kid's snack, it's sure to be a hit, because it's convenient and not too unhealthy. I'd even consider buying it again for my 3 year old. But for adults, I'd have to think there are tastier and healthier ways to get cheese-on-a-cracker than this.Additional note: my wife adds that she actually liked the taste of the cheese. In her opinion, if you like the cheese that's in the other Ritz cheese-and-crackers products, it tastes exactly the same and you won't be disappointed.  I confess to not having a ton of experience with Ritz cheese spread, so maybe it's just that I'm a cheese snob :) So, second opinion from my better half: this isn't any worse than other Ritz crackers with cheese paste.  I'll even upgrade the product from 3 stars to 2 because of this! ANSWERNOTFOUND",basically,"(10, 19)"
B001OCBT5S,same,Does the product have problem after use sometimes?,"It's hard not to compare Kraft's fiber bar with the original ""Fiber One"" bars.  If one was comparing, I'd say Fiber One bars are still better.  For one thing, even though Kraft's mocha flavored granola bar has one percent more daily fiber than a Fiber One bar, the saturated fat content is higher.  Also, there doesn't seem to be much granola in this granola bar; instead, it's covered in chocolate and...I think a peanut butter/mocha flavored strip with the consistency of whipped frosting.  Though I don't taste anything new here, except more sugar, the bars don't taste too bad.  However, I would still take Fiber One over South Beach, as the saturated fat level is pretty high, and the size of the bar is smaller.  When taste is comparable, I go for the better nutritional or monetary value. ANSWERNOTFOUND",bar instead,"(256, 371)"

Their ingredients are organic apples, organic apple juice concentrate, organic potato starch and organic cinnamon. Nothing else. I love that there is no added sugar to these and the taste is phenomenal. Very light and super crunchy. The pack is resealable which is nice to preserve freshness, but not really useful for me as I can't stop eating these until the whole bag is gone. My only problem is the price.

So I was really kidding myself when I broke off a small piece of this bar just to taste it...thinking I'd finish it later.  NOT.  In addition to tasting great, nothing in this bar has been cooked, and all ingredients are organic. It's also gluten free and preservative free.I had planned to eat this bar with a cup of tea for lunch or a snack, but it ended up being dessert.

B00934WBRO,not good,How is the quality of the taste?,"At first glance I thought this would be a nice snack for the day made out of real apples and only 60 calories are great.  However the 2.1 ounce bag has four servings in it making the actual bag 240 calories which isn't bad, but isn't exactly great.  Each serving is basically sugar with a bit of fiber (10 grams of sugar and 2 grams of fiber with no fat or protein).  The taste was extremely sweet - no added sugar, but using apple juice concentrate has the same effect .  The crunch was extreme and reminded me of malted balls.  It wasn't terribly pleasant given the large size of the spheres.While this may be better than pure candy, for the calories and the amount of sugar you might as well just grab for some chocolate.

For ease of preparation and clean-up, this product gets high marks:  cut off the corner of the pouch, pop it in the microwave for a minute and a half, and pour over your pasta, throw away the pouch.  If only the pasta was as easy to prepare...Since I normally make my own pasta sauces, I am often disappointed with prepared sauces, as they seldom meet my taste expectations.  This sauce was better than average in this area, with a great balance of tomato and basil flavors that was really quite pleasing.However, there are a number of things that detracted from my overall impression.  For all the convenience of the pouch, it strikes me as an environmentally unfriendly packaging choice.  After all, cans and jars are easily recyclable, while the pouch isn't.  And really, how inconvenient is it to heat up sauce from a jar?  Again, cooking the pasta takes longer...My other major problem is the size of the package.  This may also be a limitation of the pouch-type packaging, but the label indicates that one pouch provides three servings.  Not exactly sized for a typical family, which I expect would be the people most likely to appreciate the easy to prepare convenience.  When I tossed the contents of the pouch into the pasta I had prepared for my family, it was stretched a bit thin, so to feed four or more people, you're really going to need at least two pouches.

B005Y10X9S,perfect,How is the combination?,"Generally speaking, I have trouble with a lot of protein snacks, as they usually try to pack in the protein with a lot of nuts that I'm a allergic to. This South Beach Diet bar is a welcome exception. It's basically a crisped rice snack coated in a waxy chocolate - no nuts -and while that doesn't sound all the exciting,it is actually quite tasty. It has a good balance of carbs and fat with the protein as well, and because it is tasty, it's easy (even desirable) to eat. It leaves me feeling full and alleviates any tendency to head for the vending machine or candy jar. The chocolate held up well in both my regular carry bag and my lunch box, and wasn't even too mushy after being left in a warm (not overly hot) car. That leaves me with: tastes good, is good for me, goes anywhere. That makes this a winner of a snack. ANSWERNOTFOUND",trouble with a lot of protein snacks,"(27, 63)"

I personally like it, maybe because I know it is high in protein and fiber, so the healthy issue gets me more than the flavor.The texture is a bit different than simple semolina pasta.  It's like the penne is tougher and when cooking it al dente, it ends up with a harder texture - compared to the regular pasta cooked al dente.  My family liked it better when cooked a little longer (not al dente but not mushy either) but they weren't enthused about it.My sister in law buys this pasta regularly and often comments how her kids don't crave as many sweets during the day as they normally do, so she has all kinds of shapes of Barilla Plus.I might try other shapes maybe thin spaghetti and see if my family likes it better.

The second ingredient is honey and it is very strong. I am not a huge fan of sweet drinks and the sweetness was more than I'd like.Overall it's not a bad drink and if you have an upset stomach, ginger and honey are very good for that.

These bags are easy and I just put the meat in, add the seasoning packet, shake (move around to evenly cover the chicken breasts and than bake.  The Garlic Parmesan and Italian Herb has a great flavor, the garlic and cheese blend is great on chicken breast (and although not listed, I think it would also be great on pork chops).  The coating leaves a nice flavored baked into the meat (I use skinless chicken breast) and tastes great.In the end the convenience of these are amazing.  I can just toss some meat in with a packet of seasoning, and bake for about 30 minutes (varies on what you are cooking).  Than I can plate and have a great meal.

It was rather sweet, which is not surprising as it does have a fairly high sugar content.

Seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ of the seed so regardless of the type or brand, seeds need to be stored in freezer, in a dark, cold, sealed container, away from any moisture. If plastic container then it needs to be #5 or for me it is much safer in glass containers that keeps air out. I consume seeds within two weeks and insure not to purchase in big quantities since freshness is a priority to me due to the nutritional value which I consume food for, any food. Hemp is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in US since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy. No gain for big industries either since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma, plastic industry, fabric-cotton industry, pesticide producers, etc... so if you live in US, Canada becomes your only hope. Hemp increases my level of energy without any artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar. More energy with less empty calorie fillers like sugar and saturated fat, in all energy bars which I never consume. Hemp contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies, a component of a healthy immune system. Healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories, starch, sugar or salt. One of the best natural boosters that I can get when doing any type of sport or when I need energy without a big meal. Hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in US. Victim of its own success. This is a super food next to quinoa, kale, broccoli, dandelion, raw honey, garlic, legumes, nuts, seeds, etc...MINERALS: Hemp is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed with highest magnesium, highest potassium, highest zinc and the healthiest fat......................SESAME...FLAX....CHIA....AMARANTH....QUINOA..HEMPCALORIES.......565.........534......490......371.............368.........567SAT FAT..........34...........18........16........7................4............17CALCIUM.........99...........26........63........16..............5.............0MAGNESIUM....89...........98.........0.........62..............49.............167POTASSIUM.....14...........23..........5..........15..............16.............167ZINC...............48...........29........23........19..............21..............83FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.FAT: The most important hormone, and the one that's crucial for weight loss, is insulin. Insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage. A high-carb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream, which in turn means you produce more insulin. The more insulin the body produces, the more fat gets stored. A low-carb diet means less insulin, making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored. For intake of a massive 5,000 calories every day for three weeks with calories from a low-fat, high-carb diet; and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories, with moderate exercise regimen each time; low-fat diet stacked on 16&#8201;lb with 3.7"" (9.5&#8201;cm) around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of 2.5 lb and loss of 1""(2.5&#8201;cm) from waistline. If calorie is calorie, then in my case and my experience shows that I would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia. Almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts and that is a priority to me in type of calories since I am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat or chicken.For 28gr/1oz servings size for peanut/almonds/chia/sesame/sunflower/cashew/flax accordingly;167/137/160/162/155/150 total calories27.3/21.9/50/26.8/31.2/34.4/33.0 from carbs116/124/72.1/116/112/103/98.8 from fat21.3/21.5/15.2/17.2/19.1/17.7/17.8 is from proteinFor almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chia's ""CARB CALORIES"" gain but 50% more ""FAT CALORIES"" with high amount of nutrients for weight loss. Sesame is my calcium but almonds are the superfood when it comes to fat calories and vitamin E. Americans consume enough peanut butter each year to coat the floor of the Grand Canyon, priced for 1/3 but hardly with any nutrients vs. sesame. None offer ALA and not only flax's high ALA is needed but it balances the omega-6 which is so abandoned in all foods and not healthy at all. But, but, but, Hemp is the king for magnesium, potassium, zinc where is needed most for my muscle cramps and goes with all my work outs.Organic is always better for the planet earth and its inhabitants if organic available. The most harmful and deadly diseases plaguing America today are caused by food; cheap, low quality processed foods high in sugar, fat, salt, genetically modified ingredients and pesticides. when you reach for whole, nutrient-dense, organic foods, you get a food-remedy tool kit that not only will ward off cancer and heart disease, but also colds, flu, allergies, and a host of other ailments that plague us every day.

B000ED7M2W,old,How is the seed?,"OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious.

Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients.

B004LA1LKI,crunchy,How is the cracker ?,"Don't get me wrong - these are NOT buttery flaky Ritz like their regular crackers. These are healthy. Really healthy! So don't get all excited if you think they are going to be cheesy, guilt free versions of regular Ritz crackers. They are not that at all.What they ARE is hearty, tasty, high fiber multigrain crackers with some really sharp cheddar in the middle. The cheese is not creamy, but it's not as powdery as most ready to eat cheese crackers usually are. The crackers are a little hard, about middle-of-the-road as far as multigrain crackers go.What I LOVED about these crackers was their flavor and their fiber. Each individually wrapped bar has a generous 5g of fiber, or 20% of the minimum daily recommendation. It's not soluble fiber, but it's still a great addition to any American diet. Between the fiber, the 2g protein, and the 7g of fat, these bars wind up being really filling for only 130 calories. They only have 2g sugar, so the calories you're getting are good for sustained energy without any blood sugar spike. With a glass of water or milk, one of these would be great for kicking late afternoon hunger. (Those 100 calorie packs never quite seem to cut it, do they?) The flavor of these crackers is really good! The cheese is sharp and tasty, the crackers have a nice texture and rustic flavor, and overall they are just plain good.I recommend these for anyone looking to add some extra fiber to their diet, cracker lovers, or those who are seeking a more filling (and satisfying) afternoon snack at the office.

So I bagged 10-12 bulging full plastic baggies and put them in the freezer for use when needed.

B003GTR8IO,excellent,How is the taste?,"Mmmmmm....coffee.....love it!  Ok, I'm not a coffee master/aficionado/snob, but I know how I like my coffee: strong with cream and sugar.  Please take that into account, as your preferences may differ.  As with any coffee one is not familiar with, it takes some experimentation to figure out how to make it ""just right.""  That's my experience anyhow.  So, I usually brew it up a couple different ways to see how it will come out and adjust from there.First, I followed the instructions on the package and made a pot in a drip coffee maker.  This produced a strong coffee, but it was nasty!  The taste was like someone had dropped in an excessive amount of vanilla extract or sugar free vanilla flavoring.  Kind of like getting a vanilla latte in a tourist trap area.  The next pot, I backed off by reducing the grounds by two scoops and left the amount of water the same.  This produced a weaker but still good coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring.  *Much better* in my opinion, and very palatable.  For the third pot, I went for iced coffee, cold brewing in a French press, using the original instructions. The product was very smooth and tasty.  Letting it sit in the fridge overnight after brewing enhanced the flavor.  Finally, I hot brewed it in the French press, again using the original mix ratio from the package.  Sadly, the taste again not so good, though not as bad as the first pot.In the end, I did find two brewing methods that I liked.  While I would have preferred a stronger vanilla flavor, I wasn't able to get it out of this product before I finished the package.  Perhaps some more experimenting is in order, but, for now I will stick with another brand that I already enjoy. ANSWERNOTFOUND",coffee taste with very mild hint of vanilla flavoring,"(911, 964)"
B004LA1LKI,good,How is the pack?,"The snack basically consists of 2 high fiber crackers with processed cheese spread between them. The crackers are fine, but the cheese paste tastes like a science experiment instead of real cheese.  I know you can't expect real cheese in a prepackaged, non-refrigerated snack like this one, but there's decent artificial cheese flavor and bad artificial cheese flavor, and this is definitely the latter.  (Also, the box reads ""Natural Flavors with Other Natural Flavors"", which is a pet peeve of mine - it sounds silly.  Just say ""Natural Flavors"" already!  It's like saying ""Rainy with a chance of showers"" in the weather report.)In terms of nutritional information, there's 7 grams of fat per serving, which is high, but 4.5 of those are unsaturated fats, which is more acceptable but still high. On the plus side, 5 grams of fiber per serving is great.The main draw of this product is the convenience of the packaging. Let's be honest: for the same amount of money, you can buy a box of crackers and some REAL cheddar cheese and have a much more natural, less processed, better tasting end result - but you'd have to keep the cheese refrigerated and put the snack together yourself, whereas you can just throw a couple of these pre-made and wrapped packages in your backpack and have a quick snack handy in case your toddler runs out of fuel when you're out and about. For a kid's snack, it's sure to be a hit, because it's convenient and not too unhealthy. I'd even consider buying it again for my 3 year old. But for adults, I'd have to think there are tastier and healthier ways to get cheese-on-a-cracker than this.Additional note: my wife adds that she actually liked the taste of the cheese. In her opinion, if you like the cheese that's in the other Ritz cheese-and-crackers products, it tastes exactly the same and you won't be disappointed.  I confess to not having a ton of experience with Ritz cheese spread, so maybe it's just that I'm a cheese snob :) So, second opinion from my better half: this isn't any worse than other Ritz crackers with cheese paste.

B000FEH8ME,right,How do you like the sweetness?,"I am a raw vegan with a heavy load of health issues, including Celiac Disease and food allergies. I but rarely eat commercially prepared snack/nutritional bars because typically they don't meet my dietary requirements. I much prefer the nutritional bars I prepare myself but being chronically ill and disabled, I don't always feel well enough to go through the effort. But living in hurricane country on the Gulf coast of Florida, I do like to have some kind of food bar on hand in my hurricane pantry along with my other emergency supplies.I was excited to findPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)and have not been disappointed in the least. First of all, PURE meets all my dietary requirements for food bars: it must be organic; it must be raw; it must be vegan; it must be gluten free; it must not contain GMOs, preservatives, soy, refined sugar or trans fat; it must taste good.These chocolate brownie bars are the best! I agree 100% with reviewer Tennyson E. Stead who stated so well that these are the ""closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.""  Really!  A brownie doesn't get better than this! The Pure Bars are small but dense and quite satisfying although I could easily eat two at a time. They are moist, chewy, naturally sweet and have no added sodium. The chocolate is rich and not compromised by carob, the fruits are flavorful and sweet, the nuts fresh tasting. All the flavors are bright and nicely balanced without a trace of rancidity or moldiness, a problem I've experienced with other bars, particularly Larabar.The Pure Bar label is easy to read and contains all the nutritional information I like to see. I'm happy too that PURE Bar is certified organic and a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I am definitely going to stock up onPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)on a regular basis because I indulge in them often, not just during hurricane season! Amazon's Subscribe and Save Program is THE way to go too!  I am also signed up forPure Bar Organic Wild Blueberry, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)andPure Bar Organic Cherry Cashew, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)which are also wonderful.  But hands down,Pure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)is my favorite and I love it best! ANSWERNOTFOUND",it must taste good,"(911, 929)"
B002IEVJRY,enough,How is the taste of caffeine?,"I say I don't like coffee and I mean it, but it's not the flavor, it's what coffee is without the cream, the sweetners, the flavors.  I stop off at a place on my trip back to Chicago where you make you're own coffee mix for a dollar.  A 24 ounce version.  I make mine with about 10 half and halfs, 4 irish creams, 4 hazelnut flavors, and the overall a caramel chocolate blend.  When I heated this up I put in a half cup of half and half, and some chocolate syrup.  It was really good, but is that a fair test.I guess you can say the test was partially fine, because on occasion some old coffee left in the pot too long at the filling station has made my mix pretty flat tasting, this had some decent punch into it.  Stillk one can, is hardly a fair test of the drink.  I wish the product suppliers of food and drink items, would get a clue and include enough to do a decent review.  I've grown fond of strange cola's in the past like Moxie, I mention that one because it has a little bitterness to it, just like coffee, and is an acquired taste.  Had I not bought 12 cans the first time online of the stuff, I would have never ordered it again.  I keep it in stock now because it's a good change of pace from the overly sweet colas.  This coffee didn't give me any reason to hate it, but I don't have enough times drinking it to give you a solid opinion.  Good at least initially, but I can't speak for drinking it straight up. ANSWERNOTFOUND",It was really good,"(465, 483)"
B0040K41MY,crunchy,How is the cereal we bought from Germany?,"I was looking forward to trying this cereal, because not too long ago I was able to try a wonderful granola cereal by Nature's Path, which I liked very much.So, I expected to like this cereal too.  Unfortunately I don't!  I poured alittle bit of the cereal into a bowl.  On my first bite what I tasted seemed salty to me.  I also do not really taste a vanilla flavor, or much of a vanilla flavor.I love the flavor vanilla, especially if it's real vanilla flavoring, but there is also another mainstream brand of cereal that also came in a vanilla flavor that so many people also seemed to love, and I didn't really care for that cereal either.It does look interesting when you pour the cereal into your bowl, different shapes, which consist of corn, rice,flax, quinoa, buckwheat and amaranth.When I read the nutrition facts, except for the fact that this cereal is organic, which to me is major, the health benefits really are no better than even alot of mainstream cereals, this cereal is no higher in important nutrients.The total carbohydrates per 2/3 Cup serving is 25 grams, which is 8%,dietary fiber is 3 grams, which is 12%, and sugars is 7 grams.  The sodium level is only 130 mg, which is only 5%.  There is only 1 gram of total fat, and 4% iron.  I would call this a reasonably healthy cereal, and it is gluten free.Iam not impressed.  I wish I were.  It does not keep me from wanting to try other Nature's Path products, but Iam disappointed to find that I did not like this cereal after reading such wonderful feedback about it.Maybe I just don't like vanilla flavored cereals? ANSWERNOTFOUND",I liked very much,"(139, 156)"

B001FA1SSM,high,How is the sugar?,"Though natural and very tasty, this has too much sugar for my tastes (or for a healthful breakfast).  It's similar to frosted flakes on the sweetness scale...

B004K0630M,right,Is it fair for the food to taste good?,"I'm not big on the energy drinks and haven't used them a lot but I will use one when I need that extra boost to get through the night shift. This one is pretty good and different. It has a kinda odd flavor, kinda tart, very sweet, with a faint baking soda flavor in there somewhere crossed with very light carbonation. It's supposed to be Strawberry Banana but I couldn't really taste much that I could recognize as strawberry or banana. But other than being a little too sweet it was ok. I can say that I liked the taste of it just a little, at least I didn't hate it or dis-like it as I do most of the energy drinks. I can also say that I like it better than Red Bull. It would have been better if it wasn't so sweet and maybe had some carbonation. As for its effectiveness as a energy boost I'll have to get back to you on that. If it gets me through the night shift then it will be one that I wouldn't mind using again and probably will if I can find it.After using this last night it did help me a lot. I had more energy through the night shift and didn't have that much of a drop when it was running down. The best part was that it gave me the energy boost that I needed without making my jitter around like a frog on a hot sidewalk. It was good enough that it could possibly become habit forming since I could really use another shot of it today to help get over the slight hangover feeling that I had this morning. But fortunately for me they are expensive enough that I cant indulge myself and end up using them on a daily basis. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the taste of it just a little,"(512, 541)"
B002D4DY8G,nice,How was the coffee?,"Tired of paying an arm and a leg for flavored coffee drinks that are just making you fat? Brew up a pot of THIS at home!We buy a pouch of ""flavored"" coffee every week or so. Dunkin Donuts or Eight O'clock or folger's gourmet. They are ok with varying degrees of coffee quality and ""flavor."" We've tried Seattle's Best & Seattle can keep it. This is definitely one of the best.When I opened the pouch, I ws afraid it wouldn't have much in the way of chocolate flavor, but once it brewed...the aroma was fantastic. It's a very nice mixture of chocolate and coffee flavors without the sweet (you can add that if you must). At 7$ a pouch, it is comprable to what we get in the grocery...and quite yummy!

B00934WBRO,more,How is the sugar?,"I loved them. Their size is great, just pop them into your mouth... however extremely hard and I was afraid that I would crack a tooth. If you can get past the hardness of this product they are indeed very tasty and good for you. They are little balls of dried apples. They contain apple juice and potato starch to hold them together with a hint of cinnamon. There is no added sugar and are totally organic.  I personally can't get past the hardness of this product but the taste is very satisfying. ANSWERNOTFOUND",There is no added sugar,"(359, 382)"
B004LA1LKI,good,What do you think about macaroni and cheese?,"We have eaten other flavors of the Nabisco Crakerfuls in the past and liked them.  So I thought these might be a good option to try since the advertisement touts whole grains, and I had hoped they would be a more healthy option for crackers.  I have to say, my entire family was disappointed, for several reasons.  My kids did not like the card board taste or texture of the crackers.  They tasted stale and overly grainy and left a very dry taste in your mouth.  I did not like them because each cracker has 7 grams of fat and 220 mg of sodium per serving.  To me, that is too much fat and sodium for a snack I want to give my kids--especially since they are not ""full"" after eating them, and ask for another snack when they are done with the Crackerful.  Other than the fact that this Crackerful offers some whole grains in their ingredient list, they have the same nutritional value and caloric intake as the ""non-multigrain"" versions that Nabisco makes, and at least the other flavors, like the Four Cheese, taste much better than their whole grain counterpart.  We ended up throwing out the remaining packs that we did not sample, and I will not be buying the whole grain version again.  But the Four Cheese, non-whole grain version is pretty good, and while the nutrition is not the best, we will eat them every once in a while as an alternative when we crave a salty snack.

B001OCKIBY,large,How is the bar?,"For nut lovers, this is a very tasty chewy granola bar that is chocked full of nuts. The nuts add quite a bit of fat to the bar - 12 g total for a 1.62 oz bar, but are a good source of protein (7 g) and provide fiber (3 g).  The nuts are large and substantial. The honey roasted flavor adds a depth to the overall taste of the barAll is all this was a great tasting, relatively nutritious bar that I'll definitely treat myself to again.  It satisfied my ""candy bar"" craving with better nutritional qualities, including relative low sodium (230 mg) and a full day's worth of Vitamin E (110% DV). ANSWERNOTFOUND",For nut lovers,"(0, 14)"
B007B9WAH4,nasty,What is the taste of this stuff?,"Have been enjoying this tea with the warmer days here. Easy to mix and toss in a couple of ice cubes.If not for the following two complaints, I could give this product 5-stars:1) Half a pouch is deemed a serving. Okay, 5 calories vs. 10 calories isn't a big deal, but seriously who is only going to use half of one of these tiny tubes? Most people don't even understand how little 8oz is. Starbucks serves 8oz short drinks, but they don't list it on the menu and people would probably laugh when they saw the size...just as an example.2) Advertising that there is NO aspartame is hugely misleading because it 'suggests' there is no artificial sweetener since honey is prominently displayed and listed. Yes, there is no aspartame, but there's sucralose, which is also an artificial sweetener. And WHY even have an artificial sweetener when honey is the very first ingredient listed?I don't get why it's difficult to reconcile such issues as the ones I've noted here.Like I said, the tea is tasty and refreshing, but those who make the product, package the product and market the product need to get real. ANSWERNOTFOUND",artificial sweetener,"(770, 790)"
B004K00DGC,same,What amount of corn syrup does the formula have?,"I have a cup of green tea every morning & that's enough to keep me going. Since I was sleep deprived I thought it'd be a good day to try Jamba strawberry banana energy drink. The taste was better than I anticipated, like real juice, very slight carbonation with no detectable aftertaste. I had it along with my lunch at 1pm. Wish I had known that the 80mg of caffeine it contains is about 3 times as much as in a cup of green tea. I need to stay awake til about 11pm but I hope it doesn't keep me up all night. ANSWERNOTFOUND",80 mg,"(351, 355)"
B0051COPFI,fantastic,How delicious is the taste of coffee?,The only reason this gets four stars and not five is because it is a little messy.  A six month old or even a year old will be able to suck and swallow this product.  The straw is short so when it pops out of their mouth it becomes a pear explosion if it is still being squeezed.  The product tastes good.  It has a flavor that tastes natural and does not feel as if there has been the toxic sweet additives that are in most products.  The resealable cap is beautiful.  It is also thick enough that you can squeeze the small remainder of the product at the bottom of the pouch onto a spoon to avoid any waste.  I would recommend buying this product. ANSWERNOTFOUND,The product tastes good,"(281, 304)"
B000FEH8ME,good,Is it a good ingredient?,"I was pleasantly surprised by this product and have subsequently ordered all other flavors! The blueberry bar has just enough sweetness to make it taste like a treat. no way would I have imagined these were raw and actually good for you. The bars are dense and moist, much better than the dry, crunchy, tasteless varieties of most nutrition bars. They are a bit small but the size is deceiving. They are very filling and give me the energy I need as either a breakfast substitute or as a pick me up in the afternoon. I appreciate the 6 gms of protein and 3 or so gms of fiber. While they do have a high fat content it comes purely from healthy sources such as the nuts in the various varieties. There is absolutely no sugar or flour in these, and since I do have a wheat food allergy and watch my sugar intake, I am thrilled to finely have a product I can enjoy eating without facing the consequences later. Worth every penny and more. ANSWERNOTFOUND",have,"(47, 51)"

B004JRKEH4,creamy,Does it have good consistency?,"My first thought was that the Taco Bell sauce would be good as a dip.  Since my garden is now producing cucumbers at a scary rate, I tried the sauce as a cucumber salad dressing as soon as I opened the bottle. It worked very well. The sauce is smooth, has some sharpness to it, but is not overly spicy. After the cucumber experiment, I placed the opened bottle in the refrigerator. I will try it again as a salad dressing when the tomatoes in the garden turn red, Right now they are still green.  They will probably turn all at once, so I will have to figure out ways to consume them.My impression of the Taco Bell sauce after refrigeration was that it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise, This gave me another idea. I usually make tuna salad by mixing mayonnaise, hot sauce, and a few spices into the tuna.  This time I mixed in only the Taco Bell sauce.  Incidentally, the sauce has half the calories per tablespoon compared to the mayonnaise.  The tuna salad turned out well. It was very similar to my mayonnaise-based version.I was pleasantly surprised by my initial experiments with the sauce.  I have tried both the Chipotle and Jalapeno versions. They both work equally well.  That is, I find it hard to tell the differences in taste. The one negative is that they contain artificial coloring and flavoring.  They lose a star on that account. ANSWERNOTFOUND",it has almost the same consistency as mayonnaise,"(650, 698)"
B000FEH8ME,not great,Is its taste good?,"I like to snack on energy or protein bars before going to the gym after work.  The protein bars in particular are for the most part quite gross, so I was looking forward to trying these purportedly healthy and hopefully decent-tasting bars.  The taste is not bad.  The bars are very sweet, and do taste vaguely of blue berries.  The appearance and texture is unappetizing though - little bits of nuts and fruit are suspended in a gooey chewy base, which is colored an unappealing brown.At 1.7 ounces this bar is not very substantial.  It would make a good light snack, but I still felt hungry afterward.  Despite the weird appearance and texture, this bar was perfectly edible, unlike some of its competitors. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The taste is not bad,"(242, 262)"
B003GTR8IO,smooth,How is the taste?,"I love this coffee! It has a nice rich taste; very premium. Has just the right balance of Vanilla too which tastes great and yet is not overpowering.

You won't be disappointed! :) ANSWERNOTFOUND",nice rich taste,"(29, 44)"

B005VOOKMY,rich,How do you like the coffee?,"I usually like to grind my own beans but tried this because I had it once before and because it's organic. I tried it a few months ago and only had one cup and was pretty sure I liked it and wanted to confirm.I got this to use in my Cuisinart that is made for keurig k cups - I cut open the pods and poured the coffee into my set reusable kcup. Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this. I would probably buy again if I could use pods directly or if I could get whole beans. ANSWERNOTFOUND","I love deep , bold coffee but do n't like acidic or bitter flavor","(634, 699)"
B000FEH8ME,sour,How is taste?,"The ingredients in this bar are organic and healthy.  The texture is a little odd: It's not dry and it doesn't have that cardboard characteristic a lot of organic foods have, but it is kind of sticky and gooey.  The sweetness from the fruit sugars in the bar is overpowering and a little cloying.  You can't even really taste the blueberry over all the other ingredients.  For an organic bar, though, it's quite good.  At 190 calories it's not quite a meal, so pairing it with something less sweet to make it a meal would be ideal.  The price is, unfortunately, a bit steep, even a little more than other organic bars I have seen locally. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The ingredients in this bar are organic and healthy,"(0, 51)"
B001EO5U3I,firm,How is the texture?,"I love the taste and the texture of these steel cut oats, but they can be somewhat of a labor of love to prepare.  It can take about 35 minutes to cook them from start to finish, with lots of stirring of the pot and keeping track of exactly how the heat is regulated on your stove.  I have made them the ""long"" way many times.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and the texture is quite pleasing.  I have also soaked the oats in water overnight and then cooked them the next morning which reduces the cooking time to about 10 minutes for me.  Still the same wonderful taste, but this method loses quite a lot of the whole grain sensation in the mouth.I was in the market for a rice cooker and while investigating them I noticed that some have a setting for porridge.  When I made my choice of the Panasonic SR-DE103 rice cooker it was partially because I wanted to use it to cook these oats.  The only drawback is that the rice cooker will only cook two servings at a time because the oats foam and bubble up so much during cooking.  Any more than two servings and they will be bubbling out of the steam vent of the cooker!  It also takes one hour to cook those two servings, but I can be off doing other things while the cooker takes care of the oats.  The oats cooked in the rice cooker have the same taste and texture as those cooked for the 35 minute method on the stove.This product is delightful.  I do add a tiny pinch of salt during the cooking time.  They are wonderful with either white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, butter, or just completely unadorned.  And, which is very important, a serving of these steel cut oats stick with me and I don't find myself wanting to eat a second breakfast two hours later.  One serving lasts until lunch time and beyond (if I'm really busy).  Any leftovers also keep well in a bowl in the refrigerator and warm up nicely in the microwave.  Just an all around great product. ANSWERNOTFOUND",texture is quite pleasing,"(370, 395)"
B004LA1LKI,great,How is the texture?,"I like the texture of this product; it reminds me of stone-ground or coarse-ground bread.  I am generally a fan of crackers with a cheese filling, but the flavor of the cheese filling only moderately enthused me.  I thought the flavor could have been stronger and there could have been more cheese filling.  I could taste the flavor, but it sometimes got lost in the cracker flavor, which is good.  Indeed, the more I chewed a Crackerful, the more flavor I seemed to get from the cracker.This product proclaims on the front that it is an ""excellent source of fiber.""  One individual package has five grams of fiber, which is about 20% of the daily-recommended value of fiber.  However, those five grams of fiber is connected with 7 grams of total fat and 2 grams of saturated fat.  The total calories in the little bar are 130.  In my mind, connecting five grams of fiber to 7 grams of fat would argue against Crackerfuls being an ""excellent"" source of fiber.Another thing that influences my opinion of ""excellent"" is the list of ingredients, which extends for half the side of the box.  There are preservatives and all sorts of artificial ingredients.  What kind of person thinks a lengthy list of artificial ingredients and 7 grams of fat leads to the conclusion of ""excellent""?  Not that I am pitching any particular product, but two Fiber Choice tablets have 4 grams of fiber, 16 calories, and no fat.  The Fiber Choice is significantly cheaper and has eight ingredients.  You tell me which product you would classify as an ""excellent"" source of fiber, or at least a ""good"" source of fiber.  Perhaps excellent would be raw vegetables or fruit.I also think Crackerfuls are relatively expensive considering the available options.  For example, Austin cheese crackers tend to be somewhere around $0.17 to $0.20 per ounce.  Crackerfuls cost about $0.92 per ounce, depending on the quantity you buy.Moving beyond price and the hyperbole of advertising, I think the packaging is good.  Each Crackerful has its own individual package, which means that you can throw them in a lunch box or your pocket and not have to worry about them getting stale or soggy.Bottom line:  I like these crackers.  They have good flavor and texture and their package makes them portable.  While I panned the ""excellent"" nature of the fiber, I consider crackers like these a snack and having fiber is neither make or break for the cracker.  A bigger hurdle is the price, which I think is high as compared to alternatives.  The price suggests this product is more of a luxury than an everyday snack cracker.Good luck! ANSWERNOTFOUND",it reminds me of stone - ground or coarse - ground bread,"(36, 88)"
B006MONQMC,light,How was the taste?,"I was already familiar with the MIO water enhancers - this appears to be more of the same except with more of an emphasis on the supplemental vitamins and minerals. It takes a few times to figure out the amount that needs to be squeezed in order to achieve the optimum taste. Having figured that out to MY taste by trial and error, I am enjoying this product and it certainly seems to give me a boost of energy for my workout. I have tended to drink it beforehand rather than during. The taste is pleasant and not at all chemically. It's worth checking out. ANSWERNOTFOUND",optimum taste,"(261, 274)"
B006MONQMC,better,How is the packaging of the soup that you bought?,"If people bought ""energy"" drinks solely on the basis of taste, the market for these products would shrink pretty quickly because most of these drinks have no definable taste profile and mostly taste like diluted Kook-aid. Fortunately for companies like the aptly named Vitamin Squeeze, buyers have been so conditioned by the giant beverage companies (e.g., Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc.) to accept gawdawful concoctions falsely marketed as ""flavors"" that what the product actually tastes like is of little or no concern when the purchase decision is made.It's hard to tell what the makers of ""Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink"" want you to think of their product. The product description suggests this is an energy/vitamin drink that will enhance your health. The packaging and flavor descriptions (e.g., ""fruit punch"") suggest this stuff is a kids' drink along the lines of Kool-aid injected with a jolt of caffiene.I tried to ignore the marketing buzzwords completely and focus on the taste and the convenience factor. In terms of taste, if you ignore the flavor listed on the label, you'll have a tough time describing what this product actually tastes like. It's definitely not fruit, and it doesn't taste like any punch I'd consume. I'd say it tastes kind of sweet and mostly artificial. It's drinkable, as long as your expectations are very low and you're OK with a drink that is red and sweet and not much more.The packaging is pretty cool, though, and portioning is easy - which is why a product like this exists. Just fill an empty bottle with water, squeeze in a little concentrate, shake, and you've got a cheap energy drink in seconds.If Vitamin Squeeze can produce a drink that tastes like something grown, not manufactured, I'd have this stuff stacked to the ceiling in my pantry. Until then, I'll pass. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The packaging is pretty cool,"(1411, 1439)"
B001OCBT5S,perfect,Where is the bar?,"This chewy bar is full of flavor that will please fans who love chocolate-flavored coffee. I've had many health bars and this one is smaller than some that have the same amount of calories.

This bar contains only 2g of protein, but a nice 9g of fiber to make up for it as well as low sodium (125mg is low compared to other packaged food). Sometimes you just can get all the numbers you want in a bar (low carb, low sugar, high fiber and high protein AND taste good).If these numbers work for you and you love the taste of chocolate coffee, this will make you a happy camper.

Although the concept of the pop-up microwave bowl is a good one and means there is no bowl to wash afterwards it was a total pain to open without ripping it and spilling the popcorn everywhere.

B002IEVJRY,not strong,How was the coffee?,"Illy makes great coffee and I did enjoy the taste of this beverage. But buys should beware that what they're getting when they order this product is not so much a Cappuccino, but a regular slightly flavored can of coffee. This did not taste like an iced cappucino.Whether you choose to purchase this product is likely based on your preference for canned coffee. I can tell you that illy excels at the canned coffee product. Their coffee does not taste artificial or fake, like many of the other products. I cannot drink the Starbucks Double Shot espresso without gagging and that largely put me off the stuff. I'm not sure if I'll continue drinking this stuff, but it wasn't bad.Canned coffee is expensive if you consider how cheap and relatively easy it is to make iced coffee.

B006MONQMC,similar,How is taste?,"I've tried the Mio and now the Vitamin Squeeze water enhancers.  I didn't like the taste of the Mio, but love the taste of this one, which is Fruit Punch (a flavor I normally avoid because it is so sweet).  I didn't really feel an energy rush with this drink, but I did feel pretty good, which I would assume would be the vitamins!One great thing about this water enhancer: no aspertame!  I'm actually allergic to aspertame, and have a really hard time finding water flavorings that don't contain it.Here is the list of ingredients:  Water, citric acid, vitamin C, natural flavor, sucralose, natural caffeine, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, magnesium lactate, vitamin B3, vitamin B6, calcium lactate, potassium phosphate, vitamin A, palmitate, vitamin E, vitamin B6, vitamin B12One bottle is supposed to flavor about 24 8oz glasses of water.  I actually like mine a bit lighter on the Fruit Punch flavor, so I think it is going to last longer.The only down-side to this water enhancer is that the bottle is pretty big, so there really is no sneaking this one into my purse to flavor water on-the-go.In all, this one is a keeper and I WILL be getting more!

I am usually not a fan of the berry ones because they can have a bit of a sour flavor; but this one was GOOD. The pieces of fruit in it are actually REALLY high quality, which gives it a really vibrant, nice flavor. And the vanilla perfectly complimented the blackberry and gave it a bit of a smoother taste.  I was so impressed by it that the next time I saw them at the store I ordered some of the other varieties of Lipton's Pyramind tea... all of them unusual and interesting.  Definite 5 stars on flavor!As far as the pyramid goes, I like that you can see what is inside the packet. And you can tell it's high quality.  It steeps much faster because of the design; and they pretty much have the same number of packets per package compared to most teas, so they don't take up more room.  I'm not sure that they will biodegrade as well (I was putting the others minus the staples into my compost pile; not sure I want to do that with these, they almost feel like nylon?)

For the most aggressive coffee taste, I choose the Starbucks. And for the least aftertaste, and quick on the go drink, I choose this one.I'm not a coffee expert, so I'm not sure if that emulsified or egg white emulsified mouth experience is normal or expected, but for me, if that could be minimized or eliminated I would really appreciate this product more.

B0015KAYN2,subtle,How was it to taste?,"I bought a jar of this thing on Aug 16 for seven bucks (and free delivery if over Amazon's minimum for such). It came pretty fast, in a semi-liquid state but not leaking; rather well packaged. I let it melt completely in a warm room (CO melts at about 80 deg F) and then put it in the fridge to let it solidify. One of the reasons I did (and always do) that is to smooth out the texture: as is, every type of CO I've tried comes in like a bunch of white fibers stuck in more even liquid, but if you thaw it completely and then freeze, it becomes all evenly semi-transparent, like one thick candle sort of thing. It probably doesn't matter; just a personal quirk, I guess.Anyway, this is good stuff: the taste is nice -- very good for sweetich things like carrots or plums, for example (I always have a bowl of very lightly steamed carrots around, and I snack on them, taking one and dipping it into CO, which is good for two reasons: first, it tastes great, and second, carotene is fat-soluble so you need to combine carrots with some sort of fat or it won't be used by the body well).All in all, there isn't much to say -- CO is CO is CO; this kind is no different from other types I've tried. CO in general is shamelessly hyped as a sort of panacea from every health problem known to man; this is mostly lies, but two things are true: it is tasty, and it's good for skin/hair (I've tried both, and it's true, it works). Don't believe anything else and don't ""take"" it daily as if it were a medicine: it's pure saturated fat and that's the end of it: it will raise your cholesterol as any other kind of saturated fat. As far as its being a weight-loss agent, this is not a complete lie, but remember, it works only if you _substitute_ CO for other kinds of saturated fats (that means quit eating butter, meat, etc.) If, otoh, you simply _add_ it to your normal diet, you're not gonna lose any weight -- instead, you're gonna gain weight at least as good as you would otherwise + increase your cholesterol. But if you decide to substitute, do not think it's an easy choice: CO is pure saturated fat, whereas other sources of saturated fats (butter, meat, etc.) come with a lot of nutritional goodness like vitamins, proteins, and the like -- things that CO is wholly devoid of. So my suggestion, for what it's worth (not much, I know) is to use CO just as another agreeable food to be used in moderation, not a magic medicine. I read somewhere that a 40-sh male in good health on a 2000 cal/day diet can get 200 calories from saturated fats w/o harming himself.One other thing I wanted to mention: the jar says it's ""pure extra virgin"" -- keep in mind that ""extra virgin"" is meaningful only when applied to olive oil. That is because there are specific and stringent industry standards stipulating what constitutes ""virgin"", ""extra virgin"", etc. There are no such standards about any other oils, so saying your CO is ""extra virgin"" communicates zero useful information and is no more than disingenuous hand-waving. It's like Nutiva says on their jars ""no cholesterol!"". No kidding, it's like wood-free nails. Of course plant-derived foods have no cholesterol, but BS rules in this industry, so just be aware of what's what and smart enough to dismiss useless hype like claims of a CO being ""extra virgin"".OK, there's really no more to say: as long as you use this tasty substance rationally, it's good stuff, so bottomline is: recommended -- except for one thing: just as I was deciding it's time to post a review and navigating to this page, I noticed that the price went up by the mind-blowing 60 percent since, not just since I bought it (two weeks ago), but literally within the last few days. Does my salary go up 60 percent in a couple of days? No. So, while the product is good and I can't give it less than five stars, I will suggest you do not reward naked greed and at least try to find better-priced alternatives. Especially in this economic environment that we have right now. The current price here is even higher than it is in Wegman's (brick-and-mortar grocery store; they carry it, but it's more than the seven bucks I bought it for here).PS. Btw, I see now someone reports that this oil comes in a glass jar: this is a bare-faced lie. The jar is transparent plastic, quite soft actually, so you can't _honestly_ mistake it for glass. Be extremely suspicious about these massive five-star reviews (here and elsewhere); I for a long time have a feeling those are posted by manufacturers' employees to create hype (and why not? Amazon does nothing to guard against fake reviews; all one needs to do in order to start posting reviews (real OR fake) is buy something once from this site). Some reviews read like the reviewer hasn't actually seen the product in question and is interested only in adding another five-star rating, not the review.PPS. Thanks to commenters Lulu and Adriana for additional info and helpful suggestions.PPPS. Trader Joe's sells CO for 5.99 for 16-oz jar. It's slightly more bland than this one, but plenty good but if you use it for cooking or skin. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the taste is nice,"(699, 716)"

B000ED7M2W,old,How is the seed?,"OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy.

That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects.

They have really big peanuty taste and the nuts on top are large and plentifulThey remind me of another granola bar, the Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Peanut bars. Those too are coated with peanut butter and have big peanuts on top. These bars are very similar to those and to be honest, I really couldn't find a difference between the two. One pro I did find was that the peanut butter coating did not start melting while eating. I did not find myself needing to get a napkin to wipe sticky fingers.While these bars are filling, it's also due to high calories and fat. This would scare someone from eating this as a snack everyday but they are good for a meal replacement if you're busy and can't take a break for lunch.

B00DBSG2HS,resealable,How is the package?,"My first reaction on seeing these was, ""Does the world really need another Chocolate Chip Cookie?"" In this case, I think the answer is yes.Keebler has tried to create cookies using only the ingredients that you would use if you were making them at home. They contain no artificial ingredients or flavorings. The result is a very appealing cookie that definitely does have a ""homemade"" taste and consistency. Most store-bought cookies I've tried have either a chewy or a crispy texture. These are buttery and delicious and have a light, slightly crumbly texture. Definitely not chewy, but not what I would call crisp either.The packaging is the new type that has a peel-up tab that self sticks to the package to reseal.

I do not buy rainbow quinoas since they sell for a high price without having enough red or black but more of white but C & F sells one of the best white and red mix since C & F offers more red than white in the mix. I usually buy the white, red and black separately and mix as I wish as well since quinoa is just an important part of my diet.KEEN-Waah... A complete protein source, a seed related to other healthy cousins like spinach and beets. In a pot I place quinoa, frozen peas, carrots, corn, add water and tomato paste. Spinach is added at the end the last minute. Stewing tomatoes for a half hour increases the cancer fighting lycopene content by 35 percent. Cooking also unlocks another nutrient, beta-carotene, in corn and carrots since heat breaks down the fibrous cell walls, releasing more of these antioxidants. The same goes for spinach but then you need to get your vitamin C from something else since that is the first vitamin which is depleted with heat. I saute lots of onion separately then in ten minutes I add paprika, cumin, dillweed, gram marsala, crushed red pepper, turmeric and lots of garlic2 x 2 Pound Fresh Garlic USA California Heirloom Monviso Gilroy Finest (4 Pounds Total), mix it well and add the mix to the pot and let it sit without heat for five minutes. This is what vegans consume instead of beef since it is a complete protein. Greens, vegetables, nuts, seeds, etc. may have protein but the fact is that only quinoa has a complete protein and all others do not since all others are missing few amino acids here and there but not quinoa. I rarely ever consume beef, chicken, etc. so fish and quinoa are the only source of complete protein with all amino acids for me. Organic, whole grain, very fulfilling due to some starch with host of vitamins, minerals that no beef or chicken can even come close to. Cooks in ten minutes with some water, no fat, no salt, no sugar... I consume it with eggplant, onions, okra, smoked hearings, curry type dishes with lots of spices and delicious juices. I never ever have to wash and rinse before cooking either. I keep the uncooked portions in double zip lock bags in freezer. I consume so much that I never have to worry about the unused portion going rancid and unlike brown rice which loses its oil in less than six months and becomes worthless even if kept in freezer, quinoa will last longer. Obviously I never ever do that with any food since I only purchase what I need in order to get the nutrients which are a healthy portion of my diet. Gluten free, the best product for me when I go camping since all I do is add lemon and tomato and that way I never have to worry about paying arm and leg for that lousy, awful tasting dry foods.

Resistant starch on the other hand, resists digestion and passes through to the large intestine where it acts like dietary fiber. Sugar, honey, maple syrup, white flour, white rice, whole-grain pastry flour, packaged cold cereals, commercial fruit juices, and fruit-juice sweetened beverages are the same foods some dentists claim rots the teeth from the inside out by changing the balance and ratio of calcium to phosphorous in the bloodstream. Your immune system goes down when you wolf down sweets, especially around events and holiday meals. High Glycemic foods quickly turn to sugar in your blood stream, causing excess insulin to pour into your blood to get rid of the excess sugar. The excess insulin pushes the calcium and fat into your arteries, especially if you have only a few cholesterol receptors on your liver (which is genetic). Whole wheat and white bread have essentially the same impact on blood sugar so I try to consume bread with whole sprouted grains, even flourless breads, and no-yeast breads. Black beans, northern beans, navy beans, red kidney beans, lentils, split peas, black-eyed peas, brown rice, rolled oats, millet, corn, black rice are all Resistance Starch.

I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",brand,"(18, 23)"
B0026ZYZ7Q,not strong,Can you taste this oatmeal?,"I drink a lot of pu'erh, and I admit it can be quite an acquired taste. It is very dense and earthy, especially the dark pu'erh. Numi has taken organic, acceptable grade pu'erh and added cardamom for a little flavor and some medicinal benefits.Basically this is pu'erh for those who might not be used to it but want to start trying it out. Pu'erh has been consumed for centuries in China and it has been thought to have many medicinal effects. Studies show that pu'erh does have high antioxidant levels as well as other nutrients that are helpful for your body and especially the digestion.Just be warned, if you are not used to pu'erh it can be quite a shock. It is VERY earthy.As usual, Numi has done a bang up job with price and quality for an organic tea. The satchels are a decent size and allow the tea to expand. I recommend steeping a mug of this tea at nearly boiling temperature for about 4 minutes. But being pu'erh, you can leave it in longer and it just gets stronger but not more astringent. You can also re-steep the bag at least once, but it will make a lighter second cup.Recommended. Also try Peet's bird's nest style pu'erh if you have one of their coffee shops near you.

B003GTR8IO,better,What is coffee like?,"Starbucks coffee, in particular the dark French Roast blend, is one of my favorites. When Starbucks came up with the Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I thought I'd give it a try.First impressions:  The vanilla flavored coffee is full-bodied and smooth. It is best described as a dark French Roast with a *hint* of vanilla flavor, which complements the coffee quite nicely. Now, for folks who are into vanilla-flavored creamers, you will appreciate being able to use as much creamer as you like without worrying about overpowering your coffee with vanilla.I'm not a particularly big fan of flavored coffee, but I am surprised I actually enjoyed this coffee a fair bit. I'm glad that it's flavored with real vanilla beans, not with artificial flavoring. Give the Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee a try. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

B004TPKAN4,empty,Does the bag have things inside?,"Newman's Own and I have had a really good relationship thus far; I have at least liked, and most usually loved, every product I have tried from them. Their organic ginger snaps are no exception. The cookies are relatively small (somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), but they are filled to the brim with gingery goodness, which you would hope for in a ginger snap. I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices). The ingredients in order: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (ginger, sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium, phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that. If you're unfamiliar with the Newman's Own brand, it was co-founded by Paul Newman as a company where all profits from their food items go to various charities after taxes. It's a great cause that has fantastic, healthy, and quality products that while may be a bit pricier than other brands, won't break the bank.A little note, you might want to have a glass of milk, or cup of tea or coffee hanging around, because these ginger snaps really do snap back!

B007JFXWRC,deep,Is it a good color?,"Please see ""tea.jpg"" photo on this page. The color once steeped is tremendous, a really great ruby-red that looks like it's out of a 1940s Technicolor movie. The aroma is very pleasant, sweet and floral. The taste, however, leaves a bit to be desired. The aroma is promising you the moon and your brain is going ""Yes, yes, yes!"" and then the taste doesn't have the goods, you know? Kind of thin-tasting. I've had a locally-produced hibiscus tea which has a more assertive flavor (if not the incredible color). I'm going to let this cool down and make some iced tea later and see if that doesn't help this tea out a bit. Another sip. The aroma is heavenly. But the taste is absent.This comes not in a teabag, but a clever little synthetic-material pyramid for some reason. Very novel. Novelty is valuable. Really just the fact that this stuff is so different and comes in a little pyramid tea infuser would make it a nice stocking-stuffer type gift for the tea lover(s) in your life. Or ""teabags"" as a British ex-roommate once described dedicated tea drinkers. Another sip. Still kind of weak-tasting, but I wonder if you couldn't put this stuff in a room humidifier... (don't try this, it's just a thought because this tea smells so great)...The flavor is growing on me, but it's still thin-tasting compared to the incredible aroma...---Unfortunately, this tea wasn't very good as iced tea. Kind of tasted like watered-down fruit punch. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The color once steeped is tremendous,"(41, 77)"

B000FEH8ME,not great,Is its taste good?,"I like to snack on energy or protein bars before going to the gym after work.  The protein bars in particular are for the most part quite gross, so I was looking forward to trying these purportedly healthy and hopefully decent-tasting bars.  The taste is not bad.  The bars are very sweet, and do taste vaguely of blue berries.  The appearance and texture is unappetizing though - little bits of nuts and fruit are suspended in a gooey chewy base, which is colored an unappealing brown.At 1.7 ounces this bar is not very substantial.  It would make a good light snack, but I still felt hungry afterward.  Despite the weird appearance and texture, this bar was perfectly edible, unlike some of its competitors.

B00B9AAI9S,subtle,How was it to taste?,"I've tried a lot of different teas in my day but never a ""savory tea."" When I got this sampler box in the mail I tried them immediately and have some thoughts about them.First, they come off tasting like weak soup in a lot of ways. The flavors are very muted, as one might expect. I discovered that if I boiled the bags in water for 10 minutes rather than steep them as tea in a cup, the flavors are considerably improved and strengthened. Each bag contains either decaf green tea or decaf black tea, but I didn't taste tea flavors in anything I brewed.Dieters might well like how this tea feels a bit more like a foodstuff than tea normally does. At 5 calories per steeped cup of tea, it's a very light snack at best, but with whole-grain crackers and perhaps a bit of cheese, it'd feel like a decent lunch. I can't imagine drinking a cup of this tea by itself and feeling sated. The cup I tried was drunk at midday with no breakfast in my stomach yet, and it definitely didn't curb any hunger pangs. Middle-aged and Boomer dieters familiar with powdered bouillon packets in hot water will find these a considerably upmarket and modernized version of the old Herb-Ox standby. Once you get past the ""weak soup"" feeling, the flavors are light and bright. The Tomato Mint soup in particular functioned well as a drink.These do make wonderful poaching liquids for soups. I just got finished with an egg-noodle soup made with the Spinach Chive tea and thought it was delicious. I boiled the teabag in the water for 10 minutes, then stirred in the noodles to cook. I couldn't taste much of spinach or chives, but the broth was quite good at any rate. It's a pity they have actual tea leaves in them, or I'd have just ripped the bags open to use as seasoning for the food. I loved the complexity of flavor they produced when boiled that way and used as part of a meal. It's an off-label use, but one I recommend wholeheartedly.I can't see myself buying these except for cooking purposes--which may well happen as I did like the broth made from them--but dieters may well find them useful as actual tea to drink. I would recommend that anybody using these boil the bags rather than steep them to get the full flavor from them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The flavors are very muted,"(232, 258)"

(To the reviewer who complained that they are crumbly and break up in your mouth--that's what shortbread is supposed to do!) The honey is subtle, not too sweet, and the whole grains add some substance. The bits of fig and raisin are small--about the size of caraway seeds--and chewy. I was able to recognize the figs, but then, I like Fig Newtons, so I probably knew the flavor from that. Package says serving size is 3 cookies, but I found just 1 or 2 make a satisfying snack to nibble on without being too many calories or too much sodium. I'll probably buy these again.

They are round balls, apple flavor because they are apple balls, the perfect amount of (natural) sweetness, and crunchy.  I don't eat that many sweets, so this is perfect for me (by the way, it's not really a ""sweet"" --- maybe a natural sweet), and I love the apple flavor.I am very picky about my snacks (and also about all my foods).  There are so many things that I don't eat.  A lot of foods are eliminated for me when it comes to snacking (and regular eating).  This snack is perfect for me because it's not THAT sweet, and it tastes really good to me, and I love the crunch.It is so good, it can trick your mind into thinking it is a ""regular"" snack instead of a healthy snack.I only got 4 balls, and those 4 balls were the heavenliest balls of apple & crunch I ever tasted!  My 4-year-old granddaughter took the rest of the bag!!!  You know what that means - that means I will have to buy another bag (and not tell her that I have it) so that I can have the whole bag!  (She probably thinks they are candy - which is okay, because it is a lot healthier than candy.)I do love being a grandmother - it is awesome - even if it means having to give up my organic apple clusters.I can always get another bag.

B000F3V880,flavorful,Is the sauce tasty?,"This sauce is delicious, but you would think it would be quite hot and spicy, seeing as it has 'haba&ntilde;ero' in the name.  Haba&ntilde;ero peppers are extremely hot and you would think that would be the point of having the word in the name of the sauce, it likely being meant to tell people that this sauce is quite hot, but no; instead, the sauce has a very mild flavor of chili pepper - that's it.  Apparently, there is some actual 'haba&ntilde;ero' pepper somewhere in the ingredients, but it's toward the end of the list, so evidently, not much.

B000LWCR26,earthy,How is the taste?,"I am really enjoying this tea, which I have purchased from Amazon many times now. I can see why it is called ""honeybush,"" as the taste and aroma truly do resemble honey. It has a mellow, natural sweetness to it that really does not need sweetening, and a very mild, easy taste that reminds me of chamomile tea, in that it has a soft, understated character with no bitter note or aftertaste, and a bit of a woodsy note. I have never added milk to this tea, but I may try it and see what it does. I love it straight, and have even enjoyed the random mug I have accidentally allowed to cool down too much. I have been able to have it either in the early morning, midday, with meals, between meals, on an empty stomach, or very late at night--all with no issues. The taste is honey-like and light, with the tiniest hint of mesquite when freshly poured. If it sits for a considerable amount of time, it develops an additional note that reminds me of fig leaves. This is a completely caffeine free tea that is even given to tiny children and to people taking meds, as it does not interact adversely with anything or have any known adverse effects to the health. I have heard it is great for the skin, and perhaps it is all true, from what I have noticed. I would call this a nourishing tea. If it has any calming effects, they are probably all cerebral, and it may just be due to how pleasant and easy it is to drink, and how relaxing pleasant things usually are. If you are looking for a mellow and pleasant cup of tea that is smooth and easy without being harsh on the stomach or nerves or, alternately, putting you to sleep, I recommend giving this honeybush tea a try.

Spelling slightly of coconuts, my just oiled hands call the pets to lick it off.I use this oil for sauteing instead of olive oil because it does not smoke when I heat it to high heat while olive oil will burn easily at high temperatures.  I have also used this coconut oil when making brownies.  The slight coconut scent is just barely noticeable after cooking and makes these brownies memorable.I have not tried this oil on my hair, but on skin, it's great!  I use it daily on hands and feet.  It soaks into skin quickly and leaves it feeling supple.Viva's coconut oil contains only small amounts of medium chain triglycerides, so if you are attempting to increase the amount of those in your diet, this oil will not be what you want.

B000ED7M2W,fresh,How is the seed?,"OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless.

When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the seed is in a complete un - hulled form,"(492, 532)"

It is satisfying to know that my daily afternoon drink is providing all the vitamins i need for the day!It isn't as concentrated as some of the other flavored drink mixes on the market, which means the bottle is really big.

B003E3OTPC,great,How is it nuts?,"If you read recently that nuts are good for your heart health, this is a tasty mix.  1/4 cup is 200 calories, so you don't need a lot. In 1/4 cup of these nuts, you get 5 g of protein, 1 g sugar, and 5% of your sodium.  A serving is high in fat (26% of DV), but it's good fat.  Your body needs some fat, and the fat in nuts and olive oil is the kind you want to have, a nutritionist said.The nuts included in this mix are:PecansAlmondsBrazil NutsCashewsMacadamia NutsIt doesn't list on the container if salt is added.  I did see on a nutrition web site that sea salt is added, but haven't verified that with the company.  The container does say one serving is 5% of your sodium allowance, which isn't much.  If they are salted, it's very light.  I don't mind 5% as I eat mainly natural unsalted foods.There are no peanuts in these mixed nuts.  When I scoop out 1/4 cup of these nuts, there's about 5 almonds, a couple of pecans, and the rest cashew and macadamia nuts.  I'm not a big fan of Brazil nuts, so I let other family members eat those.  A serving size is 1/4 cup and the container says there are about 38 servings in 2.5 pounds so this should last you over a month.  It will last two months if you have the self-control to eat only 1/8 cup a day as a treat.  A nutritionist told me you should have protein with every meal or snack. so nuts are great to have on the side if you're having fruit for breakfast or a green salad for lunch.These are not too salty and the flavors are a tasty mix.  They are a non-guilty snack if you can eat a little each day. ANSWERNOTFOUND",NutsIt does n't list on the container if salt is added,"(463, 516)"

B00AHRDVFM,sensitive,When do you feel your tooth more sensitive?,"Even though this cracker is thick with taste...mine is garlicky and parmesan, the cracker itself is too thick in my opinion.I don't have the best teeth in the world and in fact have had lots of work done over my lifetime. This cracker is too thick for me to bite comfortably.  Having said that I made the most of the thickness and crunched them up into small pieces to put on my salad.As far as I'm concerned even though the crisps have the suggestion that they are good for you with some of the nutrition facts being on the front they are in fact pretty fattening.  The portion size is a mere 9 crackers with 5 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber, no sugar and 12 grams of whole grain. What isn't on the front is that within those 9 crackers are 110 calories, and 200 mg of sodium and 16 grams of carbs.I follow the weight watchers diet as a lifetime member being on maintenance and these 9 crackers are 3 points.  That won't mean anything to most people but to me I could have alot of real food instead of those 9 crackers.All in all, if you don't worry about your teeth or your weight as much as I do, these crackers are really good.

I wish it had less sugar/carbs but these are coming from the natural juices in the drink... not sugar or fructose. So, kudos there. There is a hint of carbonation that is nice as well and the kick from the caffeine is just enough to get you going.

B000F3V880,hot,How was the sauce?,"This is an excellent all-round product that can be adapted to many dishes as well as being used straight out of the bottle as a dipping sauce or as a finishing glaze.The flavors are clean and there are no wierd aftertastes from artificial flavorings.  The mango used is the fragrant green and red Central and South American Mango rather than the intensely sweet South Asian Mango.  The sauce is semi-thick and seems to contain a lot of fruit.  There are no arificial ingredients listed on the label.The predominant taste is a sweet honey, then the clean fragrant mango, then a mild hint of Habanero follows.  It is not hot as you would expect from a Habanero sauce. It would be too mild for a hot sauce afficiando, but still too spicy for a novice.  Out of 10 (1 being not hot & 10 being sucicide) this would rank a 2 staright out of the bottle, as the sweetness takes the edge off.  If this sauce were to be used in cooking (heat from cooking increases the hotness of chillies) then this would move up to a 3.5We used this sauce as a glaze over pork kebabs, as a dipping sauce for breaded chicken strips, and to make a sauce base for sauteed shrimp. The flank steak overpowered the clean taste of the sauce and so we added garlic, a half teaspoon of soy sauce and fresh chillies to ""beef up"" the sauce. This gave it a slightly Hawaiian twist.Overall a very versatile sauce than can be easily diluted/strengthened and used in many dishes.  It is worth a try and would make a nice BBQ hostess gift.UPDATE Sept 27, 2009:Over the past few months this has become one of my favourite glazes to use on grilled food.  It has been fantastic on skewered shrimp, scallops, chicken breast and even on a turkey burgers and turkey meatloaf. My vegetarian friends love this on their grilled veggie burgers and tofu.

B004FEN3GK,easy to open,Does  package is easy to open?,"HoneyMaid's Fresh Stack Honey Grahams are the classic HoneyMaid graham cracker in new packaging. In the old box, the grahams came in sheets of nine crackers to a package. Each cracker a sheet consisting of two cracker squares. In the new box each package contains eight single squares. The squares are close to being the same size. However, when I placed one on top of the other, the new crackers were just a smidge smaller than the old.Nutrition wise, it is important to note that the new Honey Made Fresh Stack Honey Grahams contain two servings to a pack. One serving of four squares contains 130 calories, 3 grams of fat, 1 gram of fiber, 8 grams of sugar and a whopping 24 grams of carbs. The crackers contain 4% iron, 0% Vitamin A, 0% Vitamin C and 0% Calcium. Overall, the crackers lack in nutrition and should be viewed as more of a treat than a staple. If you eat the whole package you will need to double the calories, fat etc.The new packaging is certainly nice at keeping the crackers fresher. And one could argue it is better packaging, because though more material is used, fewer crackers are most likely being thrown out because they are stale.Overall the crackers are not all that nutritious so eating them along with a variety of other nutritious foods is important. For a more nutritious cracker, regular whole wheat Triscuits are satisfying and delicious. But for s'mores and homemade ice cream sandwiches, it is HoneyMaid Graham Crackers for sure.

B003120YHI,few,How many calorie have a donuts?,"New Sun Crystals is a new fashionable sweetener with some unusual concepts.  The first thing I noticed was the bright green color of the package with the sunburst of granules.  Light green puts the consumer in the sought-after mind frame of wanting to eat something healthy, light, and natural.  There is a promise that the product will be ""great for cooking, baking, and everyday sweetening.""The directions were slightly challenging. It is a granulated blend of ""naturally sweet stevia & pure cane sugar.""  The directions are to use a half cup in place of one cup of sugar. One pound equals the sweetness of two pounds of sugar. A serving size is  teaspoon, which contains 10 calories; therefore one teaspoon contains 20 calories, the same as a teaspoon of cane sugar. But one teaspoon of Sun Crystals is twice as sweet as a teaspoon of sugar. The math requires a small amount of thought. It's easy to get confused measuring out this blend of sugar and stevia.As the package says, ""Twice as as sweet so you only need half as much.""  That sentence means that you need only half as much sugar as you normally do. (I think!?)Cooking?  Baking?  I turned the package over to discover an enticing recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies. One cookie, which is 1/36 of the batch, has 120 calories. There is nobody at my house who needs to eat cookies, but I thought I'd try the recipe.In the meantime, we opened it. Before making the cookies, I thought we could use some of it for everyday sweetening before making the cookies.  I stirred some into iced tea. Just like any teaspoon of cane sugar, it required extensive stirring to dissolve, and I found that I needed twice as much as half.Next I tried it in hot tea. In hot or cold tea, it tastes wonderful. It dissolves efficiently in hot tea. Soon I found myself drinking so much tea that I was consuming twice as much sugar as usual.  I love the taste of Sun Crystals!So did the other taste tester who shares tea in our office.  He drank cup after cup of delicious hot tea. Although the package says the product is suitable for diabetics, I doubted that it would help someone consume less sugar because the taste is addictive.When I decided to make the cookies, I discovered the bag was empty. I like this product, not because it helped me save calories - I don't think it did.  I know that it had many more calories than the no-calorie stevia which I normally use. I have been trying for months to acquire a taste for stevia, but no such exercise is necessary to enjoy the taste of the Sun Crystals.Also I like the self-sealing convenient package.  The product was, as my fellow taste-tester says, ""a pretty good thing."" ANSWERNOTFOUND",has 120 calories,"(1267, 1283)"
B000F3Q0QK,unique,How is the taste?,"I'm afraid we did not use the sauce as much, despite the raving reviews. We just never had the occasion to use it on the type of food we were cooking.

Open the pouch and there's not a single bar to eat, but about twenty little pieces of one. So much for convenience. Additionally, the bars are only 1.2 oz (a Clif Bar is 2.4 oz), and while the ingredients are good, they aren't organic (in a Clif Bar: mostly organic). And Clif Bars stick together in one cohesive piece like they should.

B0041NYV8E,reminiscent,How is the taste?,"I am a huge lover of ginger.  I regularly drink ginger tea brewed from fresh ginger root (very inexpensive, yet tasty) and tea brewed from dried ginger.  Both those things are good and enjoyable.  So, when I saw this product I thought it'd be a great chance to enjoy ginger in yet another form.  I imagined it would taste very pleasantly enjoyable...  DID NOT HAPPEN!  This is one of the most disgusting and vile things I've tasted in a long time.  It had an incredibly overpowering bitter flavor to it - so much so that I re-checked the instructions to make sure I had added the correct amount of water (I had).  I couldn't make it past two sips before I just put it down and said ""enough of this madness!"".  I let my boyfriend try it too, and he said the same thing about the flavor - gross.  I know that different people have different tastes and all, and maybe there's someone out there that could stomach this, but I doubt it.  My personal advice to anyone who's checking this product out, just don't!  You'd be far happier just making some tea out of fresh or dried ginger root, an option that's cheaper than buying this crap anyways.  Ugh...that taste lingers in one's mouth, too...

B003GTR8IO,pleasant,What do you think about the taste?,"Since I am a fan of flavored coffee, particularly coffee flavored with natural ingredients, I knew I had to try this coffee. As soon as I opened the package to brew a pot, my kitchen smelled of hints of vanilla (my four year old son even asked me if I was baking something).  If anything, the aroma is most satisfying when drinking this coffee, but the taste isn't too strong. In sum, this coffee is good because of its aroma and delicious taste.  I am certainly impressed with Starbucks' new vanilla addition, and I will most definitely continue purchasing this coffee. For a two pack purchase on Amazon, the price is quite reasonable.

B004YV80O4,tender,How were the noodles?,"I've reviewed other Velveeta Skillets before, and while I like the flavor fine, I stopped short of saying that they were better than Hamburger Helper.  The flavor was different, but not really better.  The preparation was easy, but not easier.  The price is higher, so not better.But I think this chicken and broccoli skillet just might be worth the extra money.  Preparation isn't any easier than HH (but really, how hard is it to fix something like this?!  If you've got a problem fixing it, you may just want to step away from the stove and go to a restaurant!).  The price still isn't really cheaper.  But it tastes MUCH better than any Chicken Helper that I've ever had before.The real strength of the Velveeta Skillet dishes is the cheese.  The Helper boxes use powdered cheese and a milk/water combo to make the cheese.  Velveeta takes advantage of their core product to offer a packet of real, honest to goodness Velveeta cheese.  the result is a much richer, cheesier meal that is really light-years ahead of powder.  Compare Velveeta shells and cheese to any powder-cheese and you'll see what I mean.Preparation is quick, which comes in handy when you're trying to fix something good and quick.  My picky eater didn't like it, though to be honest she barely tried it; in fact, she decided she didn't like it when I told her it was broccoli and cheese.  My son loves broccoli, though, and he cleaned his plate in no time.  Don't tell your kids it's got broccoli in it and they'll be fine -- the broccoli is VERY finely chopped (this is one place that I was disappointed with the Velveeta, to be honest).

B00934WBRO,great,What is the salt crunch?,"I think it's important to place a product in context before assessing its value and, in my opinion, this is not the sort of thing that is meant to substitute for the real deal. A fresh apple is going to beat a processed snack any time. However, sometimes, it's not feasible to have fresh fruit on hand or you need something which will travel well and not weigh you down as much. This is good to have in your desk, a backpack, or in your car for a quick snack, but it is essentially dried apples in a different form. If you like dried apples a little, you may like this just a bit more.The main selling point of this over dried apples is that it's crunchier and the little round balls are more fun to eat. They have an intense apple flavor brought on by the apple bits and the concentrated apple juice. The juice gives them a fair amount of sweetness and the little morsels are held together with potato starch. The main disappointment I have with these is that the cinnamon is far too subdued. This is my personal preference, of course. I didn't really detect any cinnamon until around the 3rd bite when it had built up enough intensity on my tongue to be present.If you like dried apples, these may do it for you. They are intense, but all dried fruit is. I thought they were okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to have them again.

When I make ginger tea I use perhaps 3-4 thin slices steeped in a cup of water for about 5-10 minutes with a tablespoon or two of honey.I used about  cup hot water for a pouch instead of the cup.  The ginger is nice and strong, lingering in the mouth and back of the throad.Unfortunately it's a bit sweeter than I would prefer (even when brewed to the recommended level) and there's really no lemon taste- just an aroma.There's also a somewhat bitter aftertaste that I'm not so fond of.

If one was comparing, I'd say Fiber One bars are still better.  For one thing, even though Kraft's mocha flavored granola bar has one percent more daily fiber than a Fiber One bar, the saturated fat content is higher.  Also, there doesn't seem to be much granola in this granola bar; instead, it's covered in chocolate and...I think a peanut butter/mocha flavored strip with the consistency of whipped frosting.  Though I don't taste anything new here, except more sugar, the bars don't taste too bad.  However, I would still take Fiber One over South Beach, as the saturated fat level is pretty high, and the size of the bar is smaller.  When taste is comparable, I go for the better nutritional or monetary value. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Fiber One,"(62, 71)"

B005Y10X9S,crunchy,Was the chocolate bar tasty and crunchy?,"These bars were surprisingly tasty and we enjoyed each and every one of them. They had a full rich chocolatey flavor mixed in with a little crunch in the bite with caramel type topping.  One regret is there were not more of them.  For a diet bar these were amazing in flavor and hard to believe they are considered diet.  A lot of times you get a after flavor with these types of ""diet"" food.  Not so with these.  If you want a great alternative snack for a desert this is one I would recommend.

B000FEH8ME,high,Is the coconut chips high in fat content?,"This bar was actually not as terrible as I thought it would be - I had tried another all natural fruit bar recently that tasted like a compost pile, so this was actually refreshing.  It should be called ""Pure Bar Organic Wild DATE"" because it tastes and has a texture like dried dates (which is fine, I like dried dates) with a hint of blueberry.  It does smell blueberry-ish though.  The first few bites were really good and I kept thinking that it reminded me of eating a fruit roll up... but maybe having 70 of them smashed together and eating it in one bite... a kids dream.  I didn't like the nuts in the bar.  I probably would have preferred it if it was a fruit only bar, for some reason the nuts threw me off and I got about half way through and lost interest.  My husband had a few bites and also had a similar reaction.Not sure how much energy I'd derive from it compared to other food bars, but even as a processed packaged food, it tastes light years better than most of the other bars I've tried.

I mixed roughly with an ounce of water with a few more ounces of almond milk (I free-hand measured both the milk and water) delicious!!! Honestly I heard it smelled strong and it tasted like ""earth"" not at all.

B005VOOKMY,fine,Is coffee good?,"is what my husband said this coffee reminds him of.  He likes a mid (not strong) taste.  I don't drink coffee hot. My idea of coffee is a wonderful smell in the morning that I will make and add to a latte or I guess I mean a chocolate/coffee smoothie that I make at home.  This one suits that bill.  It is a full flavor to me or strong.  I believe it would even make a second cup if I so desired.Would I pay a huge amount for it?  No, I think this coffee is relatively expensive. There are only 15 pods in the box and it happens to have Marley on the box.  Is that the reason for the cost or is pod coffee just expensive?Since I don't have a pod machine I boiled a cup of water and added it to the pod in a cup with a spoon holding it down.  Worked well for me.Good coffee but not worth what they want for it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Good coffee,"(761, 772)"

I didn't have a high and then crash. I felt a little more focused and I didn't even notice it wearing off. Pretty good drink (excellent flavor) and only 90 calories!

B003GTR8IO,chemical,How is taste?,"Starbucks French Roast (an unflavored, dark roast) is my favorite coffee which I buy in bean form and brew at home. I also enjoy splurging on fresh coffees from Starbucks coffee shops occasionally.I had not tried Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla until now, and am happy with this because it has a good vanilla flavor.Although I love the idea of vanilla flavored coffee, in the past, all the other coffee brands I've tasted which are served in restaurants, various coffee shops and take out restaurants (i.e. deli's and gas stations) had a fake chemical taste that I disliked. So in the past I avoided any flavored coffees.I have also tried some creamer products with vanilla and hazelnut flavors (not made by Starbucks) but those have a sweetner in them that has a strange, too-sweet taste for me.When I saw both the Starbuck's brand and the fact that this was a NATURAL vanilla flavor (made with vanilla beans) I decided to try it and I'm happy with it. It has a medium roast good flavor of Starbucks coffee with a vanilla taste that is not chemical-fake tasting and lacks odd aftertastes and the only sweetness is from whatever sweeter we choose to add.Bravo Starbucks! Your ""Natural Fusions Vanilla"" coffee is just right!Bonus: my package states (on the side) that  if we bring the empty bag to a Starbucks coffee shop within 30 days of the ""best by"" date they will give us a free 12 ounce freshly brewed coffee at no charge!

B00D9RRZ3Q,creamy,How about the texture of this chocolate?,"The caramel in these is good, but the texture of the truffle is similar to a soft milk chocolate, not the sticky, gooey caramel that you might expect from other candy bars. I think the caramel flavor tends to be overwhelmed by the milk chocolate. I'm a little disappointed by the artificial vanilla flavoring and mystery &#34;artificial flavors.&#34; I know real vanilla is expensive, but these truffles aren't exactly cheap chocolate. But on the plus side, there is no high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). ANSWERNOTFOUND",but the texture of the truffle is similar to a soft milk chocolate,"(30, 96)"
B000FFIEL2,delicious,How is the soup?,"I picked up the black bean and lime soup at whole foods, wanted to try one before committing to six. It's very convenient with two options, either put warm water in, stir, and microwave, or add boiling water, stir, cover for six minutes. This is great if you have a keurig or hot water source at work, or if you just have room temp water from a water bottle. Stirring is important, dig all the way down to the bottom or you'll have dry spots the water doesn't penetrate.I like spicy food and the packet delivered. After six minutes the soup was a lovely texture, soft but not mushy.  I did not pick up lime, but this soup was flavorful and filling, Perfect for work or home. I would also take this to hotels that have a microwave for a quick lunch or supper if we didn't want to go out to eat.Yummy ANSWERNOTFOUND",this soup was flavorful and filling,"(612, 647)"
B000FEH8ME,nutty,How is the taste?,"Firstly, I thought I'd be getting a box of these thru Vine, but once I tasted this bar, I wasn't disappointed any more that I only got one. I did think it rather humorous, however, that this huge box contained one little bar.These smell really good, probably due to the fruit juice used as the sugar source in them. And the flavor is nutty and tastes very much like blueberries, moreso than most ""blueberry"" products. But that's where the pleasurable parts end. The texture is like someone sat on your Great Aunt's fruitcake on a long trip to Oshkosh and then gave you a slice. It seems compacted and gooey. Nothing you'd want more than one of. Ever.Solution to factory-made bars? I have been making my own for about 3 months now. I use whole wheat flour, wheat germ, whole oats, vanilla, bananas, dates, raisins, figs, dried cranberries, hazelnuts, coconut, honey, eggs and brown sugar. Sometimes I add bits of organic chocolate. That's it. I bake them for about an hour and they are light, fluffy, chewy and fantastic. They only take about 10 minutes to mix up and cost about 2/3rds less than a box of granola bars and I get about 3 times more bars. And each one is practically a meal because I cut them large.Why can I do this so cheaply, quickly and easily, yet a food factory with a big budget can't seem to make a decent granola bar? Overhead and corporate silliness, I guess. ANSWERNOTFOUND",And the flavor is nutty and tastes very much like blueberries,"(316, 377)"
B00AV5JCDU,not strong,How was the coffee?,"I've been looking for a good cinnamon-flavored coffee, and I've tried several different ones.  Some were better than others, but none had the taste I was looking for.  When I was offered the opportunity to try this one, I thought &#34;Why not?&#34;I realize that coffee is a very individual thing -- what tastes great to me may not float your boat.  But I really REALLY like this coffee.  The cinnamon flavor isn't overpowering, but it's there.  The coffee is smooth, with none of the sharp bitterness I find too often in flavored coffees.  I HATE the charred over-roasted flavor of a lot of coffees (sorry, Starbucks), but I do like robust flavor.  The key is BALANCE: flavored coffees should taste like coffee first, with the &#34;other&#34; flavor providing a highlight, not a shadow.I use the 8-oz setting on my Keurig K75 Platinum, and find that usually gives me the depth of flavor I like best.  It was perfect for this coffee.So for me, this is it: my new favorite cinnamon coffee.  WIll definitely keep this on hand. ANSWERNOTFOUND",that coffee is a very individual thing -- what tastes great,"(258, 317)"
B003GTR8IO,subjective,How is taste?,"I like flavored coffee's but not as much as a good nice light to medium roast blend of just regular ol' Java. I find flavored coffee's to just be a bit too much. In general I actually don't like Starbucks beans that much because I find the coffee bitter with an aftertaste that stays with me for too long - and I get heartburn. Not fun. The key word on this package that got me to try it was Natural.I might be the only one but the biggest problem I have with flavored type coffee is not only the cloying taste but the extremely strong smell. If I want that strong a smell in my house I'll buy candles or spray. Usually, after about a fourth of the cup, I just don't want to drink much more - or smell it. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this coffee carries the trace of smell but it is neither strong nor overpowering. The taste follow suit - this is not a heavy roast and it does not have any bitter aftertaste. I found it exceedingly pleasant and finished the whole cup. In fact I found it so good that I would likely drink it on a regular basis. It is just perfect for me. Amazon's price is good as well.

But perhaps the best thing about them is that they're unbelievably crunchy and oddly tasty. Composed entirely of apples, apple juice concentrate, potato starch, and cinnamon (all ingredients are organic), these nifty little clusters of apple bits look like disco balls and taste like no other snack I've ever tried. Try these instead of an afternoon chocolate bar to tide you over between lunch and dinner or instead of popcorn--but don't bring them with you to eat in a movie theater. They're just too darn loud. ANSWERNOTFOUND",taste like no other snack I 've ever tried,"(450, 491)"
B0096RP84Q,thick,How is the soup?,"First and foremost, this soup is delicious. It's somewhat of a unique flavor among supermarket soups. I'm tasting a variety of flavors but most prominent is a tomato base with some spiciness. It's also a unique and handy way to package soup. The bag makes it lightweight, easy to carry, and simple to heat. It also takes up less space and it's nice to be able to microwave it in the bag. The only downside it that the plastic bag is less durable although I'm not sure what you would be doing with a bag of soup that might actually puncture it. Unfortunately, this soup like most soups is high in sodium but I did not mark it down for that. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this soup is delicious,"(20, 42)"
B005VOOKMY,nice,How was the coffee?,"This gourmet coffee has a delicious aroma, but a very mild taste. Which is good for drinking while  having breakfast, but not to drink alone or with milk, if one likes strong coffee.  The little pods are convenient for taking along while traveling. They work well on those small coffeemakers provided in hotels. One thing I didn't noticed the first time I had one, and which makes a different when brewing the coffee pods, it's that each one says, This Side Down, and of course, placing it in that position inside the pod brewer helps improve the result. The lack of bitterness is a definitely a plus. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This gourmet coffee has a delicious aroma,"(0, 41)"
B001OCBT3U,big,How is the chocolate bar to your liking?,"Basing this review on what one might expect when buying a pack of these bars, I can say that they do not disappoint.  I think they even taste better than what I expected thanks to the bottom layer of peanut butter.These bars are essentially a cluster of peanuts bound together with some kind of glaze on top of what seems to be a delicious white ""chocolatey"" peanut butter substance.  Let's face it.  If you buy a product called ""Planters Big Nut Bars"", you're expecting something like what I just described.So, when it comes to that, these bars are excellent.  They have an airy crisp to them as if there are puffed balls of rice mixed in with the peanuts to give them a more pleasing texture.As far as nutritional content, they're actually pretty good.  220 calories.  7g protein. 3g fiber, only 12g of sugar, but 13g of fat.  Compare that to a Clif Bar at 240 calories, 10g protein, 5g fiber, 22g sugar and 5g fat, and it's probably a smarter move to go with the Clif Bar.  But the Big Nut bar is no slouch.  It's certainly a viable option when competing with other typical energy bars on the market.So, if you like peanuts, and you want to try a new energy bar, I would definitely recommend giving these a shot. ANSWERNOTFOUND",pretty good,"(742, 753)"
B006MONQMC,strong,How did you like the aftertaste?,"Water ""enhancers"", or ""energy"" drinks are all the rage now. So this new one by the stand alone company of Vitamin Squeeze, is entering a crowded market. Claiming to be an all natural flavored product, the list of ingredients on the bottle is pretty long (longer than the ingredients listed on both Amazon and the companies webpage). Vitamins A, B3, B5, B6, B12, and C have been ""added"", along with Taurine, Magnesium, electrolytes, and caffeine. Each serving squeeze flavors an 8 oz glass of water, and there are 24 servings in a bottle (or perhaps not - see below).To put this enhancer in perspective, a typical 1oz serving of espresso packs a punch of 40 to 75 mg of caffeine; 40 mg is what this water enhancer provides in an 8 oz glass. The added benefit with the squeeze is that you don't have to add calories via cream and sugar, and you've got a few vitamins thrown in as well. Another plus, is the convenience of simply squeezing in the flavor and caffeine.However, taste wise, the fruit punch tastes like sugar free gum. So yes, it's got that weird phony aftertaste that makes you screw up your face after drinking it. Another problem comes from the squeeze method per serving. One full squeeze delivers much more than is recommended, so each bottle comes no where near 24 servings.All and all, I'm going to stick to coffee and tea for my caffeine, and truly natural juices for my vitamins. ANSWERNOTFOUND",is recommended,"(1227, 1241)"
B004LA1LKI,great,How was the snack?,"First impressions: Package was easy to open - and by that I mean the individually wrapped cracker things.  You know how sometimes those plastic-encased things can be hard to open?  No?  Well, sometimes I have trouble with them.  But this took little effort to tear into.  I opened it up and:BAM!  That smell of cheese hit me in the face.  But not cheese - specifically, it smelled of cheese-whiz.  That stuff was awesome - when I was in college.  You know cheese-whiz?  I used to love spraying that junk on RITZ crackers on college while watching TV.But I'm not in college anymore.After the strong smell of fake-cheese hits you, a hint of wheat makes itself known.  That's the cracker part of these things.I pulled out the ""crakerfull"" only to have it come apart in my hand.  I'm not kidding - the cheese-like-substance isn't strong enough to hold the crackers together.  As I pressed down (very lightly) on one end, the whole thing flipped open.  I had to squish it down to keep it together.Taste: It tastes just like you'd expect: it tastes like the american cheese-whiz stuff on ""wheat"" crackers that have that grainy texture to them.  They're not terrible - but I wouldn't say they're good.  I had one as a snack, and was hungry shortly afterwards.  I would have originally thought maybe I can take these golfing which I like to do with things like this - but they don't taste that good, and they don't hold you over for very long.* I have no idea why the RITZ logo is on these.  RITZ crackers are utterly distinctive in their own right.  They have a specific taste and texture unlike any other cracker made in America.  These things are nothing like a RITZ product, and I have no idea why they would associate the RITZ brand with some pseudo-cheese product on wheat-ish cracker boards.-So, yeah, I didn't really like them.  They don't look like they're marketed towards kids - but they sure do not taste like anything a grown-up would want.

B005XVZKGA,slight,Do you like the taste?,"The water tasted okay to me - just like any typical bottled water I've had.  I didn't get a strange taste like some other reviewers mentioned.  I thought it was fine.  The caffeine is a nice pick-me-up.  I do not like coffee or tea, so I thought caffeine in water would be perfect for me, as I am trying to give up my beloved Code Red.  However, I think the price for Avitae water is just too high for what it offers.  There are caffeine tablets that I've read about and may try if I decide to eliminate all pop from my daily routine.  If the price for the Avitae was lower, then my rating would probably be a little bit higher. ANSWERNOTFOUND",However,"(337, 344)"
B004MO6NI8,more,What is the effect of caffeine?,"Granted, No Fear is better tasting than most of these types of energy drinks.  It's fruity like a popular canned punch and there is enough in this can to split between two adults.However, regular coffeehouse drinkers may be a little disappointed if they don't feel the same rush they get from an espresso shot, though this also contains a significant level of caffeine.  Also, to try to put it mildly: If coffee tends to ""run through you,"" don't be surprised if this has a similar effect.Despite the impressive list of supplements, this is not a health drink, by any means. It cannot overcome the fact that High Fructose Corn Syrup (after carbonated water) is second on its list of ingredients- it's a GMO food additive that dehydrates the body, for starters.At 66 grams of sugar in one can, it's like drinking fruit flavored soda with vitamins added. This may seem effective short-term if you're mostly interested in a tasty energy boost and you prefer this type of method to obtain your sugar intake.Unfortunately, the nutritional supplements cannot counteract the other ingredients, especially if you need increased energy long-term.

The coconut flavor was noticeable and you could smell it too. It really did only take a few minutes to have a great meal ready. I used chicken instead of beef and it was really good. I'd imagine it'd taste good with pork as well. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The sauce was fresh,"(41, 60)"
B005XVZKGA,slight,Do you like the taste?,"When I received this caffeinated water I refrigerated it before drinking because I could not see drinking it without it being chilled. As it has a slightly sweet taste that seemed odd when you drink water that is clear and no flavor. The sweetness would take an acquired taste, I could not acquire this unless I was a diabetic or something else that was medically forcing me to drink this. It was more like drinking medicine then water. The caffeine possibly gave a little energy however I usually get my energy midmorning or mid afternoon with coffee. I cannot really recommend paying high priced for water that has caffeine in it and no extra paring.I hope this review is helpful to you. One afterthought if I were going to pay out extra money it would be for some designer water that I've heard from in the past. ANSWERNOTFOUND",drinking it without it being chilled,"(97, 133)"

I know that it is vitally important to drink plenty of water each and every day, but I have never been one who could make myself drink much of it.  It is because of this that I am always on the lookout for great water beverages and let me tell you, I have had little luck.  Most mix in leave an ick aftertaste because of the fake sugar.  I also greatly dislike carbonated drinks.  When I saw this Essentia product, I was very curious to give it a try.  Through the years, I have tried many different brands of bottled water.  Some have a ""soapy"" taste, some have just a plain weird taste and others are not bad.  Where does Essentia fall into?  I would have to say that it falls into a category that ranks high on my taste bud o meter.The bottle claims that it has a silky smooth taste.  I don't know if I would say that, but it does have a very crisp and fresh taste to it.  I spent the afternoon outside mowing (on a rather hot day) and when I came in, I cracked open the bottle of Essentia.  It was delicious.  Now, of course I was dying of thirst, lol.  An hour later I am nearly finished with the entire bottle! For me, that is amazing, lol.  I am really enjoying the way the water tastes (or lack of taste, whichever the case may be, lol)  I can honestly say that I will hopefully be purchasing more bottles of this in the very near future.

B007B9WAH4,pleasing,Why do I have a pleasing taste?,"The name ""Tea and Honey"" for this product is a little confusing.  At first, I wondered if they were hot tea mixes with little packs of honey to squirt in (sounds good!).  Instead, it is a competitor for the single-serving Crystal Light sleeves.  From that perspective, the low calorie count and use of sucralose (Splenda) is not surprising.  Also not surprising is the strong chemical flavor.  With that said, I highly prefer these!  The flavor is better and has less of an aftertaste.  Even with the chemicals, there are more natural flavors.  Also, the food coloring is not as intense as Crystal Light, which leaves me with red saliva for hours.I would personally prefer an all natural alternative from Lipton, but compared to other cold drink mixes, these Lipton options are near the top.

B00HHFWJS2,endless,How is the possibility like?,"I considered giving the product 2 stars, but I decided to go with 3, because I know some kids that no matter how hard the parent tries, they don't eat their vegetables. So my first suggestion is always, try very hard for your child to eat vegetables, prepare them in many different ways until they like them.Carrots should be easy enough, they are sweet and crunchy, most kids love that.So lets get back to the product.- 1 packet provides about 2 servings of vegetables. However, based on their recipes, and a normal amount a kid would eat, they might get 1/2 a serving of vegetables in the end. Which while better that nothing, amounts to not much more. 1 big carrot has more calories and nutritional value than 1 whole packet of these carrot blend ins.The mac and cheese recipe was pretty good, you can feel it adds a little bit of sweetness and thickness to the sauce, any kid that likes mac and cheese would most likely love it too, and don't really know what it had. This is why I gave it 3 stars instead of two.Given that each packet doesn't have much nutritional value, and that we are in fact hiding veggies from children, I feel like it's a counter productive product. And worth it of 1 or 2 stars max. But because I know some children that simply refuse to eat veggies, this is a way for them to get a little bit in their diet.Additional, the packets don't have extraneous ingredients, just pure vegetables, so it's not a typically junk packet.Again - only recommended for those parent that have tried every other avenue to get their children to eat vegetables and are at a complete loss of what to do.

B0081Q1KJU,fresh,What do you think about popcorn?,"ORVILLE REDENBACHER READY TO EAT POPCORN - SHARP WHITE CHEDDARBeing a popcorn fan I was interested to see how the new ready to eat popcorn by Orville would be.  Popcorn people, he has done it yet again!Coming in a 1.5 ounce bag that is bright red and quick to draw your attention, this popcorn rocks.  The white cheddar taste is abundant, yet not over-whelming.  The taste is smooth and mild.  The popcorn is crunchy, the kernels large, and very tasty.  There is no residue on your hand while eating as I've experienced with other brands of flavored popcorn.The nutrition facts for a 1.5 ounce bag are as follow:Calories -- 240Calories from Fat -- 140Total Fat -- 16gSaturated Fat -- 2gTrans Fat - 0gCholesterol -- less than 5mgSodium -- 420mgPotassium -- 130mgTotal Carbs -- 21gDietary Fiber -- 2gSugars -- 2gProtein -- 3gThis is good for a quick grab and go snack; however, I much prefer microwave popcorn or regular popcorn.

I adore the packaging, the name, and even the story behind its birth.The taste is delightfully refreshing and different.  And while it does nothing in aiding the diet or lowering your sugar intake, it does make you feel better about drinking it since it is not a soft drink per say.My husband who hates all things that could potentially be healthy would allow me to put this into his lunch.  It was a huge deal that he liked these.  Again, it's better than the Mountain Dew he constantly drinks otherwise.Fun, fruity, and unique... we do buy this juice occasionally.

B0051COPFI,horrible,How is taste?,"A co-worker and I tried a packet of this gourmet, organic pureed juicy pear and garden greens before we gave it to the baby.  Honestly,  baby food never seems to taste spectacular to me.  This tasted better than most of the stuff that I'd feed my own children years ago.  Over the years, I've tasted some baby food that I immediately spit out, and never fed to our children.  This wasn't bad and, in a pinch, I'd eat it again.  I think that the price is about $1.50 a pack ... is it worthwhile to you?  The taste is better than most, in my opinion, and it was very well received by the baby who ate it and wanted more.  It's packaging is convenient.  As parents, we can put the lid on a refrigerate as needed, although lids can easily get misplaced.  Since it is shaped like many juice containers today, kids are ""primed"" to accept this.  The nutrients appear to be very good.  The only ""downside"" that I see is - ""plastic"" containers that'll sit in landfills for ages whereas the old glass jars would be recycled easily.  I give everything that I review a grade, and I believe that this merits an ""A-"".  I'd try this or one of the other flavors to see if your child likes the taste.  Review the contents first to make certain that there are no known allergies.  I highly recommend this pureed baby food (something I'd never imagined that I'd ever say before).

B0041CIP3M,good,How were the potatoes?,"I am a curry FIEND, if it's curry I almost always like it. My fridge has just about every Mae Ploy I could find at our local store. When I saw the Prima Rendang, I was anxious to try it, as I've made this before from recipes I found online.If I found a restaurant that served this, I would buy it, weekly. It's SO tasty, a nice fresh bright clean tasting curry, flavorful without tasting like it has too much salt or sugary sweetness. It tastes like I ground the spices and made the paste myself, it's THAT fresh. I have never made a curry this good at home before.PRO*Easy to make (see tips below) with a payout that is restaurant-quality. You could serve this to guests and they would want to marry you!*The sauce is generous enough that you could easily feed 4 people or a little more if you put in some extra veggies. I sliced up some green onions and I think peas would be good in it, or some grated radish or even a little potato if that's your thing.*Prep time is very fast*Everything you need for the sauce is in the box*All the spices and chilies are so perfectly balanced, you get a total experience of the curry and not just a few spices standing out more than others. It was honestly hard for me to pick out separate flavors, such was the harmonious balance. If I had to guess what spices were in it, that would be hard to do. Wonderful blend. They are listed on the box as: Chili, galangal, onion, shallot, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, ginger, lemon grass, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper, cinnamon. I think they forgot to add ""crack"" into their list, I'm already jonesing for another bowl of this.CONS*The bits of leaves in the sauce kept interfering with my enjoyment of the dish. I know they are important to impart that fresh bright taste, but I felt like I was chewing my cud. It was like having bits of lawn clippings in my food and was annoying. I think this could be offset by using more veggies than I did.*The coconut powder can be lumpy and grainy, see tips belowCOOKING TIPS*The sauce thickens quickly and wants to stick to bottom of pan, I'd cook the meat to ALMOST done and then combine with the sauce.*Mix the coconut powder and water together, and then whisk in the paste. My coconut powder was lumpy as heck and left a grainy texture and bits in my gravy. Or, save the coconut powder for another use and just sub in a can of your favorite coconut milk. Eliminate or drastically reduce the water if you do this, try the can of coconut milk first and if you need more moisture add in a little water.*Use coconut oil to cook the meat in, it adds a nice flavor to the sauce.*this makes a LOT of food. Especially if you add more than just meat, you could easily feed over 4 people with it. I froze an extra serving to see how it stood up to the process, and it didn't separate. Package your leftovers into lunches or future dinnersNUTRITION INFO: Typically I see coconut powder with sugar of some kind added, but this only lists maltodextrin. The Rendang Paste does have palm sugar and sugar listed in the first few ingredients. Just the box ingredients have 75 grams of carbohydrate, with 45 grams of that coming from sugar. That's a lot of sugar bang for the buck.  The entire box also has 1650 calories, 135 g. of fat, with 105 of that being non-animal saturated fat from the coconut. The entire box also has 3450 mg of sodium. Let's face it though folks, no one is going to sit and eat the entire box. (I know, I tried!)If the sauce weren't grainy from the bits of coconut powder, I would give this a 5-star rating. I would love to see this sold as a paste packet or jar, so that I could use my own coconut milk brand. This curry paste is SO amazing, I would love to be able to buy it by the jar and use it on ribs, burgers, chicken, etc.UPDATE: Using the tips to preblend the coconut powder, my second batch was smooth. This also does work with a can of coconut milk, omit the water. This product is available on Subscribe and Save, and it was so good that I signed up to get regular shipments of it. When I have bad bad food cravings and am tempted to go drive out to get something, now I always have this on hand and it is so satisfying! It's good with chicken, beef, and pork. I haven't tried any other meats. But d*mn, you gotta try this. ANSWERNOTFOUND",bad food,"(4093, 4101)"

B005XVZKGA,clean,How to get a clean taste?,"Just like different brands of regular bottled waters have their own taste to them, so does this avitae. It reminds me of the most un-softened water you can think of. It tastes a lot like the water we get straight from the tap here in Northern Minnesota (we have really good water). I don't drink coffee at all, next to no soda at all and basically just drink black tea and water. So any caffeine I get usually has to be in the form of a hot cup of tea, not always the best beverage for warm summer days. With this avitae, I can have a cold bottled water on hot days and still get an energy lift from caffeine. Also if you decide you want to liven up the water a little, you can add a few drops of drink mix to it to turn it into whatever kind of drink you want. Mixes likeMIO Strawberry Watermelon,Crystal Light On The Go Natural Lemonade PacketsandVitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punchwould be perfect to have on hand in case you're out and want to give your caffeinated water a boost of flavor.

B00485GY1M,old,How is the seed?,"Navitas is a good brand. I purchased this for my friend since she does not want to go through the process of grinding. If grinding is an issue, then this is the next best option, only if it is from a reputable brand but rancid is a serious issue with all flax seeds regardless of the brand, regardless organic or conventional...OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",next best option,"(161, 177)"
B000FEH8ME,pleasant,What do you think about the taste?,"This is one of the most satisfying energy/snack bars that I have come across. The pure nut and fruit flavor is very light and does not make you feel like you are eating processed food at all. Unlike many other sports bars, there is also no discernable aftertaste, nor does this bar leave you feeling bloated or otherwise uncomfortable.

B001FA1SSM,perfect,How is the amount?,"Wow. What a taste! This cereal is simply delicious. The multi-grain flakes are crunchy and sweet but not too sweet, with a subtle and not-overpowering taste of honey. The package is loaded with scrumptious dried strawberry pieces, whole dried raspberries, and a sprinkling of dried blackberries. The dried fruit has a very fresh taste, and adds a delectable flavor to the cereal. I served mine with a small carton of strawberry yogurt, and the flavor combination was terrific. The cereal is comparatively low in calories and high in fiber, so this is a great way to indulge in a good-for-you treat. Yum.

B005IW4WEA,interesting,What does the tea taste like?,"""Ingredients you can see & prounounce...""  Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff ""on-the-go!"" as the package copy boldly exhorts.To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some Equal over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no ""refined sugars"" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for ""sugar,"" like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.  But, likeKashicereals, it's a bit too concentrated and a bit too spendy. ANSWERNOTFOUND",purposes,"(1323, 1331)"

It actually tasted fresher than Bear Naked and I can eat 1/3 of a cup for roughly the same calories as 1/4 cup of Bear Naked.  (The rest of the nutritional info is roughly the same between the two brands.)  The Kind granola has a nice crunch and didn't get soggy when mixed with yogurt.  The cinnamon flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  It's packed with whole grains, Omega 3 and other healthy ingredients.  It would also be good served as a cereal with milk.

People see ""all natural"" and the name ""Jamba Juice"" and are duped into thinking this is something that is good for you.  If you want juice, drink juice.  If you want caffeine, have some coffee.Despite my feelings on it's lack of health benefits, the taste is decent.  If you are looking for an alternative to some of the other energy drinks on the market and prefer a fruity product, this would be a good choice. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This product was just alright for me,"(0, 36)"
B0025UCHT0,gritty,How was the texture?,"I've only used Barilla Spaghetti Plus Multigrain once, but it seems to be a decent product. It is similar in texture and tenderness to white flour pasta and it has no noticeable flavor, at least not with the relatively light sauce (basil, olive oil, lemon juice, capers, salt, garlic) that I used. It does not have the chewy texture and nutty flavor associated with whole wheat pasta. Nutritionally, it has more fiber and protein than Barilla's white flour product, but less fiber than their Whole Grain (51% whole wheat) product. Calories are the same for all three products. None have a lot of fat, but multigrain has the most. Some people would argue that the whole grain product is healthier than the more heavily processed product. I don't know, but multigrain does appear to be a better nutritional choice than white flour and a more palatable choice than whole wheat. ANSWERNOTFOUND",It does not have the chewy texture and nutty flavor associated with whole wheat pasta,"(298, 383)"
B006MONQMC,bit sweet,How is the taste?,"Everyone has different tastes and likes so for that reason I've rated this 3 out of 5. Personally, the taste is quite yucky.. like a super sweet something or medicine like taste.. Perhaps some people will be ok with that. I wouldnt mind it IF the product gave me some energy as it states. I felt no difference. I use 6 hour energy drinks and  Mio to compare the product too and both those products (although tastes may not be the best) worked very well giving a boost of energy. This bottle is alot bigger too, and only a squeeze is suppose to do the job. Like any product as such I would recommend trying it out once as it may be ok for you or it may not.I personally like the smaller portable bottles. Another thing it needs to be used within 30 days of opening...... something to keep in mind so your forced to use it on a daily basis or it will go bad.

B002IEVJRY,dark,Why is this coffee too dark?,"I received both the Caffe and Cappuccino versions and did a side-by-side taste comparison to see which of the two I might prefer over the other.First I tried the Caffe version and was surprised to discover it was just black coffee. I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice. It's small and convenient to slip into a purse or briefcase. While the coffee is mild, it still gives a quick pick-me-up in the morning, or in the middle of the day if need be.

B00DF0KXYK,fresh,How is the popcorn?,"This microwave popcorn comes from my favorite brand of popcorn, which I usually make in my hot air popcorn popper.This tries to incorporate a nifty bowl into the bag, by opening in such a way at the top that the bag becomes a ready made bowl.  In this regard it is an epic fail.  The ""bowl"" bag has a red strip that you pull which supposedly causes the top of the bag to open widely into a bowl shape.  I could not manage to pull the top red strip in the way shown on the package, and instead had to rip the entire top of the bag off.  I had to then pour the popped corn into a big bowl to eat it, the same as any other microwave popcorn.  I consider myself very handy at most such tasks too.  This simply doesn't work the way it was intended to.The popcorn is almost delicious if you like a lot of salt on it.  There is no butter flavor at all that I could detect, but since I never put butter on my popcorn I didn't miss it, but still, I was expecting to taste at least a bit of butter in this.This fully popped and was almost starting to burn in the microwave in under two minutes, although the directions say to pop it for 2 - 2.5 minutes.Even if I had managed to get the top of the ""bowl"" open as directed, there was no flat bottom on it that would have allowed it to stand up on its own.  The taste of the popcorn is very good however so for that I gave it two stars.  There were more unpopped kernals than I would have liked.I don't recommend this. Left a bad taste in my mouth for a long time after I ate it---yicki. ANSWERNOTFOUND",microwave popcorn,"(5, 22)"
B0016B9FSU,dry,What is your first opinion after use the skin product?,"I have been so intrigued by all the advice on using coconut oil for everything from frying foods to making your own beauty products. I just couldn't invest in it until now because it's such a BIG jar and kind of pricy at the grocery stores.I'll cut to the chase here...the first night I got the tub of coconut oil, I grabbed out about a tablespoon and put it through my hair, roots to ends. I was a little sad that it doesn't have a coconut smell, but it is supposed to be organic and not added junk for scent. So no problems there. It did leave my hair greasy that night...duh! No way you could go out with this on your hair ;)  I left it on all night. The next day I shampooed my hair twice, then used my usual conditioner. WOW Just that first day my hair feels softer and is visibly shinier! I love it!! Now I know I will be grabbing a jar that does have a coconut flavor for cooking, I imagine shrimp would be fabulous in coconut oil.I also make my own facial cream. I have not added to coconut oil to my current mixture (several vitamin e tablets emptied, crisco (look it up), oil of olay, vitamin e lotion) because I love it the way it is.

B000VK3ZGA,fine,Is coffee good?,"I have a cup of this with me right now and am pleased to report that this coffee is quite good - smooth, mellow and surprisingly rich. The low-acid blend removes the bite and aftertaste w/o sacrificing the full flavor. It has an almost smoky undertone that I wasn't expecting. I would certainly recommend this not only to those who need a low-acid blend, but to anyone looking for a full bodied, but mellow coffee. I suspect this would be great with pastry or danish and as an after dinner drink. I made it using an ordinary, decent drip machine and it came out wonderfully. I like this coffee a lot.

B001FA1SSM,less,How many calorie have this yogurt?,"Back to Nature Summer Berry Blend whole grain cereal is almost exactly what I would expect from a 100% natural cereal. the ingredients are: whole grain wheat, whole grain wheat flour, barley flour, malted barley syrup, evaporated cane juice, molasses, grape juice concentrate, sea salt, vitamin E, brown sugar, barley flakes, honey dried strawberries, dried raspberries, dried blackberries, vanilla extract.  I always think it is a little fishy when a company uses many different sweeteners, presumably so the sugars can be lower in the ingredient list. This cereal contains wheat, if that is an issue for you. I found the cereal plenty sweet without adding any other sweeteners. It is rather high carbohydrate of 46g (5 g fiber) in a 1 cup 55g serving. There are 210 calories, 17 grams of sugar, and 5 grams of protein. I usually don't add fresh fruit to cereal so I find it convenient for it to be in the cereal. The flakes do not go soggy quickly, but in my first bowl, I couldn't notice any blackberries. Maybe they are at the bottom of the box.  I will buy this product occasionally.

B002D4DY8G,bitter,How is the flavor of the coffee?,"Original review:I love Gevalia coffees. I used to be a subscriber to their coffee service and would look forward to my monthly shipments. For the most part their coffee is simply stellar. This coffee smells delicious out of the package, and while brewing, but the chocolate taste is too much for my palate. Never thought I would say that something is too chocolatey but this is! If you are a choco-holic this might be the perfect coffee for you. It is a chocolate truffle so I guess it is to be expected.Update to this review:A couple of weeks later I returned to this coffee. But with one difference. I halved the amount of coffee I brewed with and voila! The flavors came right out in a very pleasant way. The mistake was definitely mine. I like my coffee strong yet I was defintely making this coffee too strong! I say, if you love chocolate and coffee you should give this a shot but make it with about half of what you use to make regular old coffee. The flavors just come right out in a balanced way. My original review was three stars, I have upgraded to four. Could be a 4.5. I would definitely buy this coffee again.I have written many reviews and have never updated one. I was so surprised by how good this coffee turned out that I felt impelled to re-write my review.

But I will now buy it --  since it is actually quite good.If you cannot drink coffee, and don't like tea that much, then this is a way to get your caffeine.  It has 80 grams of caffeine, which sounds like a lot but after I drank it this morning I really felt energized and not extremely caffeinated.  Traditional caffeine feels very agitating to me.  I also like the fresh taste and the juicy-ness of this drink.  If you are looking for a way to get your caffeine burst in the morning (or afternoon) without using the more traditional ways of getting it, then this is great.This would also be a great drink to travel with.

The watered down taste of the coffee sticks with you, so be prepared to need something to clean your palate afterwards.I do not know if the one I got went through some sort of shock or excess moisture phase during shipping to fridge, but I found it to taste watered down (not sure if it was just mine or all), the coffee is very strong and has a bold taste, but due to the watering down it takes a way from the flavor and makes it tough to drink.

B004K00DGC,small,How is amount?,"Not a fan at all. I was looking for a healthier energy drink (if there is such a thing). This claims all natural ingredients to give you more energy. Caffeine was added and to me that is not a 'natural' ingredient. I would have thought a whole food source would have been utilized for the energizing effect. I believe this had 70 calories for the can. it was sweetened with stevia. It had a bad taste. I was only able to drink about half a can because the flavor was so fake and sweet. I give it three stars for trying to be healthier. But the main ingredients are apple juice, lemon juice, caffeine, and stevia. Really not much there.

B004FELBH8,healthy,What is the taste?,"Many of the reviewers describe the Newtons Fruit Thins as bland and flavorless. This is not a sweet snack, but it has the slightest touch of fig. It's not an overpowering taste, like a fruit filled biscuit or blueberry muffins. I usually dislike figs because of their taste, but these fruit thins do not have an overbearing fig taste. The slight dash of honey sweetens them up and I really enjoy the simple flavor of these.The texture is crisp and light while leaving behind a feeling of satisfaction. I expected them to cause my mouth to be a bit dry, but I could eat several of these without water and be perfectly fine.I really enjoy these fruit thins because of its ""blandness,"" but its a great snack that I will not become addicted to, like Oreos. Those taste great, but I have trouble convincing myself to not devourer them within a week. These fruit thins are great for anyone who's looking for an snack that only has a slight hint of sweetness. My grandmother enjoys them as well as my three and one two year old cousins. I will definitely purchase a box if I see them at my local supermarket. The price seems a bit steep for just four boxes of snacks, thus the 4 stars. I don't mind buying a box every so often because they are a great snack, but I feel that there are cheaper alternatives.

B002D4DY8G,delicious,How is the coffee?,"I brewed the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee both in a Cuisinart automatic brew coffee maker and a french press. I followed the instructions on the package - 1 rounded tablespoon for each 6 ounce cup of coffee. I found the same taste results with both methods. I like a good cup of black coffee but am not fanatical about it. I do grind fresh bold or medium body beans each morning and use filtered water to prepare the pot.As someone who usually adds a little espresso or instant espresso powder to most chocolate recipes I know this flavor combination is a wonderful marriage. Depending on the percentage of espresso to chocolate, the result is either a deep mocha flavor with the coffee playing a major role, or a small addition will result in complex chocolate flavor with no obvious coffee component.  Unfortunately, with the Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee the merger of coffee and chocolate adversely affected both the coffee and the chocolate flavor.There is a definite aftertaste from the artificial flavor, and the coffee itself is bitter and acidic. I do not know if the artificial flavor affected the coffee or the coffee is bitter and acidic on its own but, after each sip I had an involuntary puckering reaction, not my lips, but the inside of my cheeks as if I was consuming something containing acetic acid, like vinegar, not that it tasted like vinegar - it didn't.  The flavor was remarkably unpleasant, and when the cup cooled off, it tasted worse. Even the aroma while brewing smelled artificial.The other reviewers who mention how greatly improved the flavor became once cream was added is an indication of a consistent problem.  I love the taste of coffee and like it unadorned - no cream or sugar. I only add cream if I am in a restaurant and the coffee doesn't taste good. I use the cream to doctor-it-up in hopes of salvaging some of the flavor and masking the poor aspects whether caused by bitterness or coffee that's been sitting in the pot too long.  This coffee is no exception, the cream vastly improved the drinkability, but the action is akin to smearing butter on a day old roll. Underneath it is still a stale roll, and although the butter tastes delicious, it would not be accurate to call the combination a buttery delight.On the positive side, flavored coffees are usually light body and the Gevalia is definitely medium body. The packaging is quite attractive and the name is clever, but in the end may work against the product because Dark Chocolate Truffle evokes a clear taste profile for most people and the coffee doesn't live up to the name. I am rating the coffee three stars instead of less because if the purchaser always uses cream in their coffee, many of the taste issues I encountered should be if not resolved, at least mitigated.

B004JRMG98,creamy,How is the sauce?,"This sauce was better than I expected. I didnt think it was spicy but my 8 year old daughter did. Children's taste buds are more sensitive than ours and I do like spicy food so I guess it depends on your taste buds. We tried it on ground beef tacos w a tomato/jalapeno/cilantro mixture I make and on chicken soft tacos w bacon and sour cream. It was good on both but better w the chicken. The cilantro overpowered the sauce with my beef tacos. It was also good on taco salad, which I made from the leftovers.

It tastes ""fresh,"" for lack of a better term.  Containing 100% fruit juice is a huge step forward for a soft drink - not really because it's going to supply you with a serving of fruit or anything, but because it's actually FOOD.  (Corn syrup + some contrived chemical flavoring of other soft drinks, in my book, is not food.)All in all, this is good, has a great flavor, and just has a ""cleaner"" flavor that the sugary/corn-syrupy stuff.  (I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.  Other fruits are usually used as flavoring, not as sweeteners.  A strawberry (or kiwi) may taste sweet when eaten whole, but the juice by itself really isn't sweet enough to be passed off as ""juice,"" except by fanatics.)Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants a good tasting natural soda.

With strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries mixed in, they provide an excellent burst of flavor.But they are by no means the only flavor: just the flakes have a honey-and-vanilla flavor to them, so even eating those alone (how I started eating it) was still very tasty.Word of warning, however:  make sure your teeth can handle this stuff.  The flavor is absolutely delicious, but the texture of the flakes have the same rigidity and CRUNCH of the original ""Grape Nuts.""  (Of course, ""Grape Nuts"" had no flavor except whatever cardboard flavor they managed to leech from the box they were in, but that's another story.)Basically, if somebody is talking to you while you're enjoying a mouthful of this cereal, you won't be able to hear them over the crunching - but you won't care much, because you'll be savoring the flavor and not paying attention to them anyway.

This is also a gluten-free product. My first impression after biting into you reminded me of a fig newton. It has the same type consistency and flavor.

B006MONQMC,fantastic,How delicious is the taste of coffee?,"This is unlike the concentrates that I've ever tried. I like the taste and ease to use. It has concentrated sugar that adds a real nice flavor. As you can tell in the ingredients listed on the product page it has vitamin C listed third, behind water and critic acid. Also a natural form of caffiene, B3 and B6. These provide a pick me up to me after consuming a couple of 8 oz glasses with ice. The bottle is enough to last me about a month, when drinking about 8 oz a day on average. it comes in handy when I run out of soda or don't want a cup of coffee. The amount of natural caffiene is low and does not give me a nervous or jittery type feeling. I use a little less than the suggested amount because of my taste due to the fact that I prefer less sweet drinks.The price is good, and the Subscribe and Save brings it down another five percent.

I would recommend this product as a semi energy drink or a replacement for Kool-aid, as it does have some valuable vitamins. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This unlike,"(0, 14)"
B003GTR8IO,as good,What does this taste like to you?,"Having lived my entire life in the great state of Louisiana, I've always been partial to local coffee brands such as Community Coffee and Mello Joy.  I try to make a point of buying these local brands for the simple fact that the money stays in Louisiana and both of them taste very good.  To me, Starbucks has always been an overpriced and overhyped brand with a brilliant marketing strategy that put them on the map.  Still, I sometimes visit the local Starbucks for a frappucino or even an Earl Grey latte when I have a bit of extra spending money on hand.I picked up Starbucks' Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, via the Vine program.  I have to admit that it's a very good coffee as far as flavored coffees go.  The scent of the vanilla intertwined with the coffee hits you before you even open the bag, but do not use that as a device of judgement until after you've brewed a few cups of this coffee.As I've already said, the smell of vanilla is strong, but the actual vanilla flavor is very slight.  In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.  The vanilla flavor was miniscule.With one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, I found that the vanilla flavor stood out a bit more, but was still fairly weak.  The overall taste of the coffee was good, though.With two teaspoons of cream and sugar, the vanilla came into its own a bit more, but could not overtake the coffee's taste itself.Overall, this is a coffee drinker's flavored coffee.  If you want a fuller, sweeter vanilla taste and less coffee taste, look elsewhere.  If you only drink flavored coffees as a treat but prefer the taste of medium to dark roast coffee alone, this brew will be right up your alley.I personally enjoyed this coffee, and plan to buy more of it soon. ANSWERNOTFOUND",very good,"(278, 287)"
B005ZC39JM,great,How is the granola?,"This very generous sampler package of breakfast foods. The granola is delicious not too sweet and not too much much fat. It is nice granola for putting into yogurt because it has fruit in it.The pancake mix is a bit grainy so I let it sit for 30 minutes to soften, before cooking. I don't really like oatmeal but I will use it to make cookies.I had not heard of Bunnery granola before, I used Bare Naked but Bunnery is just as good. Highly recommend.

Even though they are packaged air tight the cheese was crumbly and the cracker seemed like it was staler than it should have been.  This cracker would normally be a little hard, but this was more so. I didn't care for the multigrain.  I was really surprised at the quality of this cracker because I eat the original Ritz crackers every day.  I only ate one cracker and that's plenty.

B002IEVJRY,full,"What is the taste, taste and quantity of food they serve?","I was looking forward to trying this product because I love coffee, but find most canned coffees too sweet. I like that this drink didn't have sugar, allowing me to control the sweetness. Some people will like that it has a fairly high amount of caffeine considering its small size, but for me that's a non-issue. It has a mild coffee taste, but I would have preferred something deeper and richer. It also had a tingly sensation that I didn't case for -- almost like a really light carbonation. I'm guessing that's from the canning process.Taste is, of course, subjective. For me, the product had a decent taste, but didn't blow me away. I'm glad I tried it, but probably wouldn't order it. That said, if you're looking for big caffeine content, a mild coffee taste, and a sugar-free drink then you might be pleased with this canned coffee.

B005HG9ERW,refresh,Does it have a strong taste?,"This is definitely one of the better bottled waters I have tasted. It has a crisp clean flavor that tastes more like a distilled water than a spring water. It doesn't have a soft taste, which I find many bottled waters do have. It reminds me more of the flavor of Dasani or Aquafina bottled water over softer ones like Fiji water. Each 1.5 liter bottle is huge, so keep that in mind when comparing price to number of bottles. These are much larger than you would drink in one sitting. Very delicious cold, right out of the refrigerator! ANSWERNOTFOUND",It does n't have a soft taste,"(156, 184)"

B001FA1SSM,not bad,Was a bad stuff?,"This is my first time tasting anything made by Back to Nature and I have to say that based on this I will definitely be trying more . . . when and if I can afford them.The flakes are wonderful, a great balance of crunchy and sweet and savoury. They're also thicker and crispier than pretty much anything else on the market, which makes for a unique but pleasant eating experience.The fruit is freeze-dried, of course, but is uniformly pleasant, still tasty very fruity without even a hint of the ""freezer funk"" flavour that a lot of similar freeze-dried fruits suffer from. It was also nice to have more fruits on offer than just strawberries.The only drawback, the only criticism, really, is that freeze-dried fruit can leave streaks on plastic, and the little plastic window in front, while offering a useful peek at the product, is streaked with whitish marks that remind me of the crust left over on my windshield after a snowstorm - a combo of salt and dirt. Not very appetizing.Looking at the rest of the products from this company, I see that unexciting is the order of the day for the most part, which is unfortunate - a food this tasty deserves a better package.

B002IEVJRY,intense,What do you think about the taste?,"I usually have very low expectations for these kind of canned coffee, but this one was better than I thought. It has a sweet coffee taste, reminding of real espresso. However, it felt more like americano than espresso (meaning it is more diluted with water than necessary). It still packs enough caffeine, and if you do not want to go the ""5 hour energy"" route in urgent needs (like driving early in the morning), it would be a good alternative.I would recommend it cold, so keeping in the car might not be an option.

B004U43ZO0,soft,What is the texture of the chocolate?,"These cookies are not bad but I expected more from Chips Ahoy. The reason I love their regular cookies so much is because they are crunchy. These are not, they are very soft and chewy and that is not a texture I love in a cookie. While these cookies aren't crunchy, the chocofudge in the middle is a nice and added treat. It would be nice if the original crunchy cookies had this middle and then they would have a homerun on their hands. As it stands, these cookies are just okay.

B001EQ55ZO,tasty,How is the nuts?,"First off, let's start with the product description for these cashews that appears on the product page: ""Lightly roasted with natural sea salt and a hint of pepper - Value added seasoning for the consumer who is tired of plain old cashews."" From reading that description, one would assume that these cashews have ""a hint of pepper."" That is not the case. These cashews are LOADED with pepper. When I first opened the container and saw these nuts, it looked like someone had wet them and dredged them in black pepper. And believe me...You can taste the pepper; and it stays with you. Very, very spicy. Too much so for me. I also agree with other reviewers who have said the nuts are too salty. WAY too salty, with 270mg of sodium in a single 1 oz. serving. Now, back to the ""value added seasoning"" description...Nowhere in the product description does it mention that these nuts have SUGAR added to them. Sugar? With salt and pepper? Add that to the ""granulated onion"" that also appears on the list of ingredients and maybe you can understand what I mean when I say that there's just a bit too much going on here flavorwise. You can't even taste the nuts!! I love cashews. And I love seasoned cashews. But these just don't make the grade. I think my biggest complaint is definitely the amount of pepper that are on these. It's WAY more than a ""hint."" Stay away from these nuts unless you want to make your taste buds very, very angry and give yourself some major heartburn. ANSWERNOTFOUND",These cashews are LOADED with pepper,"(355, 391)"
B006BXV1H6,small,What is the size of the box of chocolates?,"My wife and I have seen the Krave cereal in stores, but we havenever bothered to pick it up. She's pretty much a chocolate Mini-Wheats person and I am more a Honey Nut Cheerios person (Unless they bring back Smurfberry Crunch). We had a choice of either box as an Amazon Vine option and I chose to do the double chocolate thinking the wife would like it better. Little did I suspect that we would try a few handfulls dry for a texture and taste sample...and then proceed to eat nearly the entire box in one day. Both of us are pretty physical fit people that watch our wastelines and exercise regularly, buy man oh man, did we keep coming back to the box for ""just one more taste."" This cereal is delicious and we'll be picking up another box (and probably the other flavour) until we get sick of it or Kellog's decides not to make it any more (ala General Mill's and my beloved childhood favorite Fruity Yummy Mummy).I was really happy to see that there was no high fructose corn syrup in Krave and that it's actually pretty nutritous for a chocolate cereal. It's low in fst, has no cholesterol and has a decent amount of fiber. A single serving is only 120 calories and there are only 10 grams of sugar, whichs urprised me as it has a nice sweet taste to it. There really is no downside to the cereal. Our household is really happy with it (even the rabbits!) and we'll definitely be getting this again.

B001OCBT3U,large,How is the bar?,"I recently got a chance to try the new(ish) Planters Big Nut Bars from Kraft Foods and I have to say that they're pretty darn good.  If you're into granola bars, these will be a little bit of a departure as you really don't get that kind of consistency.  These are also nuttier, and overall seem to be more akin to a nut-based candy bar like a Payday.As far as the pluses go, the bars have a nice balance of sweet and salty, and though the consistency doesn't scream granola bar, it's just chewy enough that it also doesn't scream peanut bar (like the various brands of peanut brittle-esqe bars you tend to find in vending machines.)  The peanut butter coating on the bottom also has a nice consistency and taste, not chalky or too sweet like peanut butter tends to get in products like this.  Also, at 46 grams, it's pretty satisfying, and I'd think it would certainly make for a decent small meal on the go if you're in a pinch.There are some drawbacks though.  Mainly the bars can get a little messy where the peanut butter is concerned, so I can imagine it would be a nightmare with kids.  The bars are also pretty high in fat, which isn't as much surprising (they are peanut based), as it is unfortunate.  At 13g of fat per bar (3g saturated), these really are in the category of meal replacement, and not snacks.  If you're looking for a healthy snack I'd stick with a more basic granola bar. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the bars have a nice balance of sweet and salty,"(376, 423)"
B005VOOKMY,nice,How was the coffee?,"This gourmet coffee has a delicious aroma, but a very mild taste. Which is good for drinking while  having breakfast, but not to drink alone or with milk, if one likes strong coffee.  The little pods are convenient for taking along while traveling. They work well on those small coffeemakers provided in hotels. One thing I didn't noticed the first time I had one, and which makes a different when brewing the coffee pods, it's that each one says, This Side Down, and of course, placing it in that position inside the pod brewer helps improve the result.

B005ZBZLT4,stale,How is the coffee?,"5:45 a.m. The alarm just went off. You want to be on the road before 7. You find the kitchen, get out the kettle and start the water boiling. Get out the Boodum, fill it up. Wait. Water boils. Pour it in the press. Wait.  Wait more. Can't wait any longer. Push plunger, drink, coffee is weak, pillow starts calling your name, you lose the will to shower, next thing you know, it's 8:15 and you're praying for the grid to melt down.OR, you get up at 5:45 a.m., drop a K-Cup in your Keurig, push a button and your cup runneth over (especially if you accidentally pushed the button with the picture of the mug on it).  And if it's San Francisco Bay Fog Cutter, you also get a deliciously rich, full-bodied, fragrant brew that is acid free and gentle on an early morning tummy.  Best of all, you can drink your Fog Cutter while waiting for the stuff in the Boodum Coffee Press to be ready. Now you can face the shower, the hair dryer, the curling iron and the eyelash curler without fear.I prefer the Boodum to the Keurig, but when you need coffee now, this blend can't be beat.  It's the best of all the K-Cup offerings that I've tried, and I've tried everything from Donut Shop to Newman's Own and most points in between.  It is my early morning wake up favorite.I was very amused, not to say impressed, by one reviewers comments about the packaging  He notes that there is a drawing of a K-Cup type machine on the front of the box and a list of various K-Cup brewers that will accommodate this version of the K-Cup.  He points out that the San Francisco Bay Coffee supports many environmental projects, as noted on the top of the box, which also shows photos of these worthy projects.  The Rodgers Family, who own the company, are shown in a family photo on one side flap, along with an essay on the company's values.  The other flap has a description of the actual coffee.

B004TPKAN4,strong,How do you like the tooth?,"Newman's Own and I have had a really good relationship thus far; I have at least liked, and most usually loved, every product I have tried from them. Their organic ginger snaps are no exception. The cookies are relatively small (somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), but they are filled to the brim with gingery goodness, which you would hope for in a ginger snap. I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices). The ingredients in order: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (ginger, sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium, phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that. If you're unfamiliar with the Newman's Own brand, it was co-founded by Paul Newman as a company where all profits from their food items go to various charities after taxes. It's a great cause that has fantastic, healthy, and quality products that while may be a bit pricier than other brands, won't break the bank.A little note, you might want to have a glass of milk, or cup of tea or coffee hanging around, because these ginger snaps really do snap back!

B0061IUKDM,superior,How is the quality?,"I enjoy drinking and brewing tea, though I'm no kind of expert on the beverage.  My cabinet is full of various brands of tea and all kinds of flavors.  It's safe to say I don't shop for Lipton or store brand orange pekoe when I can help it.  Generally I like green tea for days when I'm feeling a little under the weather, or when I'm eating Asian cuisine.  When this came up on Vine, I figured, what the heck?This is a perfectly serviceable green tea blend from Higgins & Burke.  The packaging is fairly pedestrian (no fancy tricorner bags, etc.), but done well enough to keep the tea bags fresh until use.  The main thing is that this isn't quite green tea as the label says.  It's green tea with lemongrass, lemon balm and verbena leaves.  Now, that's not to say it's bad.  It's green tea with a little kick to it, an added set of flavors that blend well.  But if you were expecting simply green tea, it could be a disappointment.  I like it fine in a mug with a little honey, though if I'm in the mood for real quality green tea, I won't have this as my ""go-to"".On the plus side, it makes a great iced tea.  I brewed up a batch with some mint leaves and have been enjoying the treat in this unseasonably warm Spring.

The blueberry bar has just enough sweetness to make it taste like a treat. no way would I have imagined these were raw and actually good for you. The bars are dense and moist, much better than the dry, crunchy, tasteless varieties of most nutrition bars. They are a bit small but the size is deceiving. They are very filling and give me the energy I need as either a breakfast substitute or as a pick me up in the afternoon. I appreciate the 6 gms of protein and 3 or so gms of fiber. While they do have a high fat content it comes purely from healthy sources such as the nuts in the various varieties. There is absolutely no sugar or flour in these, and since I do have a wheat food allergy and watch my sugar intake, I am thrilled to finely have a product I can enjoy eating without facing the consequences later.

B001EQ55RW,crunchy,How is the almond?,"Low-carbers who've experienced the make-or-break chocolate-craving moment can thank their lucky stars that these exist. Just when your will is weakest, a few of these extremely chocolatey treats can make a respectable substitute for peanut M&Ms.; In a way, they're even better, because they don't make your blood sugar seesaw wildly.I do agree with some of the critical reviews of these almonds: They are not for people who hate Splenda. However, I don't find the amount of Splenda excessive. I find it just right. Most importantly, the almonds are huge and fresh and perfectly roasted. The cap also makes a handy serving size. I keep one canister in the car and one by my desk to ward off hunger pangs and candy cravings. And my 5-year-old son loves these and eats 'em like candy. He doesn't know they're good for him... that'll be my little secret. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the almonds are huge and fresh and perfectly roasted,"(533, 585)"
B00DILCU92,bit bland,Is it taste good?,"I'm not really a fan, and won't get these again. The flavor, while somewhat ""grainy"", wasn't bad. The bars were especially crumbly though. Open the pouch and there's not a single bar to eat, but about twenty little pieces of one. So much for convenience. Additionally, the bars are only 1.2 oz (a Clif Bar is 2.4 oz), and while the ingredients are good, they aren't organic (in a Clif Bar: mostly organic). And Clif Bars stick together in one cohesive piece like they should. No trouble eating them during active sports (cycling, etc).Anyway,Clif Barsare my go-to 'bar food' of choice for packing for trips, accompanying extended exercise, etc. I'm always looking for new healthy options, but these don't compare.

It doesn't absorb sauce well and it takes forever to drain the liquid adequately.  I made my normal meat sauce, drained the pasta for three minutes, put the pasta into my sauce and cooked it for another three minutes.  That should have absorbed the extra water but unfortunately, it did not.  My sauce (which I made extra thick) turned watery on the plate once served.However, having said that, the pasta itself tasted great; as good if not better than a regular pasta.  I wish there were a way to reduce the liquid without having the pasta get mushy (over cooking in the sauce) or cold (by draining for extended periods.

I don't know. I do appreciate that it's fortified with vitamins, and that there are no artificial flavors or sweeteners. The packaging is friendly / easy to access.I've never partaken in the South Beach diet (I'm quite anti-diet anyway), so I am not looking at the product from that standpoint, but just as a consumer interested in a snack or part of a lunch.

B008GZ1A7I,delicious,How is sauce?,"The instructions on the back of this packet are very simple: cut 1 lb of chicken breast into strips, pan fry it with 1 Tbsp of oil, then mix in the sauce, bring to a boil, and cover and simmer over low heat for 5 minutes.  They suggest serving it over pasta, and show it on a bed of vermicelli on the packet, but rice made more sense to me with an Asian-inspired sauce, so I made rice to go with it.The sauce is nice and thick and has a pretty good flavor, though it's not as...robust, I guess, as I might like it to be.  I think salting the chicken before cooking would have helped a little.  Cooking in sesame oil instead of regular olive oil might have helped too (since I was reviewing for Vine I wanted to stick to the basics).  My roommate liked it well enough to all but lick the pan clean after I'd portioned the food out, but his is not the most discriminating palate.  40 calories for the sauce for 1 of 4 servings, plus roughly 125 for 1/4 lb of chicken (precooked weight) and 30 for 1/4 Tbsp oil, and then any starch and/or vegetable you might serve with it, is a very reasonable portion size.Even though it's not amazingly fancy or super-flavorful, this is a great option for an easy, interesting sauce for a quick weeknight dinner, and I'll probably look for this (and other flavors) in my supermarket for that purpose.

B00934WBRO,bit bland,Is it taste good?,"I've purchased the dried apples from this company before and figured I would give the clusters a try.I appreciate the fact that this food id USDA organic, gluten free, corn free, and vegan. In fact, the ingredients are simple: organic apples, organic apple juice concentrate, organic potato starch, organic cinnamon.In a 1/4 cup of these apple clusters, which remind me of rolled up oats ans/or hemp cereal, you receive 60 calories, with 0 calories from fat. There is no cholesterol, no protein, 1% of calcium, 2% of vitamin C, 2g of dietary fiber, 10 g of sugar, and 14 g of total carbohydrate.All in all, a healthy snack. The packaging makes it convenient for the on the go snack -- it is in a resealable 2.1 oz pouch (60 g), or four servings per package. Just enough to tantalize the senses, but not enough to pig out.The clusters are sugary bowls with a tint of cinnamon and a crunch reminiscent of cereal.Honestly, I prefer the taste of a real apple or the dried apples this brand sells at Starbucks, but in lieu of that, this is a good healthy snack alternative.Allergy alert: If you are extra sensitive, beware that this food is processed in a facility with nuts, dairy, wheat and soy. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this is a good healthy snack alternative,"(1027, 1067)"
B001LGGH54,outstanding,How is the taste of a good black licorice?,"This is a extremely tasty drink, but I am partial to watermelon flavors. The flavor is subtle, but you absolutely pick up the watermelon flavor. Its not drowned out by the strawberry, which is usually the case in strawberry-watermelon flavored food items. This drink is lightly carbonated, much less than a standard cola drink, but the carbonation transforms the drink from a juice-like, powdered drink type to a much more refreshing, original beverage. The drink is not overly sweet, but just enough to enhance the watermelon-strawberry flavor, and not too caloric. I am anxious to try the other flavors. (its a small can, but the price is not too bad.) ANSWERNOTFOUND",This drink is lightly carbonated,"(256, 288)"
B00934WBRO,high,What hope did put by waiting these prodacts?,"I love apples and usually take them to work for snack.  Apples are sturdy and easy to carry in the lunch bag.

Snack comes in a small resealable pouch (2.1 oz). One serving size of 1/4 cup has 60 calories and no fat.  This snack also has a small amounts of vitamin C and calcium.Snack comes in small clusters that are perfectly round and very, very crunchy.  Only a few clusters will fill you up.  It is gluten free.

B004DIR3TQ,not sweet,Is a delicious chocolate?,"I love dark chocolate, but I think my tastes are a little too pedestrian because this chocolate was just too bitter and not sweet enough for me. I am familiar with cacao percentages and usually prefer my dark chocolate in the 60-ish percent range, though I will eat up to 70 percent occasionally, and this confirmed my belief that more isn't necessarily better when it comes to chocolate percentages.This chocolate clocks in between a bittersweet of 70 and unsweetened at 99, so it was really hard to know what to do with it. I tasted it straight from the bar, and it is very, very dark with hardly any sweetness at all. It was bitter but not overly harsh. It's obviously good quality chocolate so I can't fault them for that, I simply prefer something a little sweeter. I can't see myself craving a piece of this to eat. I don't even think I would eat it for health purposes.I went to Scharffen Berger's website to see if there were any recipes for this chocolate, but all I could find was one for lace sandwich cookies (with the chocolate in the middle) and a pecan tart. They did suggest pairing this chocolate with marshmallow to make s'mores, so that is what I did. The chocolate melts beautifully and had a smooth taste that went well with the sweet marshmallows and graham crackers, but honestly I still think I prefer a lower percentage chocolate.So, if you are a big fan of ""more is better"" when it comes to chocolate percentages, and like your chocolate on the extra dark and bitter side, this is a fine choice. But if, like me, you prefer a slightly more sweet taste without compromising the richness of a bittersweet flavor, you might do better off trying one of their lower percentage chocolates like the 70 or 62%. ANSWERNOTFOUND",not sweet enough for me,"(120, 143)"
B002D4DY8G,rich,How was the chocolate taste?,"Our family isn't a big fan of flavored coffee beans. I feel they usually have a very artificial taste, and sometimes leave a strange bitter after-effect.Needless to say, our first morning trying this Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee we weren't expecting anything special, but we were pleasantly surprised. The chocolate flavor is full and rich, in fact a almost too rich! Making a full cup of coffee seem a bit too much. This is a flavor to savor, not chug on the way to work.Since then, we've been adding about a tablespoon of the Gevalia to our regular blend in the mornings, and it's amazing this tiny amount adds such richness and flavor to our morning cuppa.Not cheap if used alone, but if you stretch it out by making a blend with cheaper coffee as the base, you'll be thrilled at the wonderful rich flavor.

This coffee would do the job in the morning if I didn't have any better stuff to drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it.  It's just not very flavorful.

B002IEVJRY,fine,Is coffee good?,"Illy makes great coffee and I did enjoy the taste of this beverage. But buys should beware that what they're getting when they order this product is not so much a Cappuccino, but a regular slightly flavored can of coffee. This did not taste like an iced cappucino.Whether you choose to purchase this product is likely based on your preference for canned coffee. I can tell you that illy excels at the canned coffee product. Their coffee does not taste artificial or fake, like many of the other products. I cannot drink the Starbucks Double Shot espresso without gagging and that largely put me off the stuff. I'm not sure if I'll continue drinking this stuff, but it wasn't bad.Canned coffee is expensive if you consider how cheap and relatively easy it is to make iced coffee.

B001EQ55RW,delicious,What do you think about almond?,"Anything that claims to be ""dark chocolate"" flavored immediately has my attention, as I'm a true chocoholic with a preference for the intense bittersweet flavor of a good dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, these cocoa-dipped almonds don't deliver on the promise of their name, although they are indeed a good, nutritious (but high fat) snack with a hint of sweetness and chocolate flavor.  Not surprisingly, the predominant flavor is almond; the nutty, skin-on taste overwhelms the chocolate dusting.  Nut lovers will likely appreciate the twist on an old favorite since the cocoa does indeed bring out the almond flavor.  The almonds are crunchy and roasted to perfection, with few or no overdone brown interiors.Diabetics and others who watch their sugar intake will be pleased to learn that this snack contains only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving because of the addition of sucralose, an artificial sweeteners better known commercially as Splenda.  Dieters, however, will want to be careful with the 13 grams of fat in that same size serving.In general, I like Emerald nut products, but this one disappointed me, mostly because I found the chocolate flavor lacking and because I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  When I crave nuts, I go right for this canister, but when I crave chocolate, I look for something else.Also from the same company and recommended by me:Emerald Nuts Glazed Pecans, Pecan Pie, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12),Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Peanut, Honey Roasted Peanut & Cocktail Peanut, 4.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 18),Emerald Nuts Glazed Walnuts, Original, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12) ANSWERNOTFOUND",these cocoa,"(203, 214)"

B00B9AAI9S,good,How do you like the teas?,"This is not your average tea experience, that's for sure! I didn't have high hopes after a disappointing experience with another Numi tea recently, but these are surprisingly good. They aren't sweet at all, so don't expect anything like the average herbal tea, or even anything strong like a black tea.Instead, these six different flavors are mild and savory, almost like a light broth. In fact I bet you could brew a few cups and use that as a soup stock. There aren't any bad flavors in the mix, although some are more intriguing than others. The ""Tomato Mint"" really didn't have much of a mint flavor at all, so I picked a mint leaf from my herb garden and tossed it in to spice it up, but otherwise they all clearly taste like they should.These non-traditional teas may take some getting used to, and people who don't like savory flavors where they would normally be sweet likely will hate this, but it definitely worked for me. Give it a shot and it may just be your odd new favorite. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This is not your average tea experience,"(0, 39)"

There seems to be about a cup of these clusters in the package with the total calorie count at 240, and 56g carbs, 40g sugars and 8g fiber.

If I'm looking to mix drinks or perhaps even make a punch, I could see using this but I could also get plain seltzer water to do so and get the same flavor.As to my thirst, I didn't notice that I felt any less or more thirsty though I really did not like the taste.Definitely not a product I would buy when I have perfectly good water from our city or I can use a filtration system to get water that tastes only like water.

B004U43ZO0,artificial,How is the taste?,"I loved the ""gooey"" cookie line when they first came out. This edition has a nice chocolate-ish flavor but there's nothing 'chewy' about it. The cookie is too gooey to have a texture and all the cookies within the same compartment just smooshed together forming a cookie blob. This brings up the best use for a package of these cookies--if parents of a preschooler have ticked you off, give their kid a package of CHIPS AHOY! CHEWY GOOEY CHOCOFUDGE..and tell the little angel to make a monster cookie blob to eat and play with! If you are still of an age to play with your food this would be the cookie of choice to smear on the walls and mash on your face.(Seems kind harsh on the parents--if they have a preschooler, don't you think they've been punished enough?)The other ""issue"" is the crumbs. These cookies don't stand up to the rigors of the real world. About one third of the mass of the cookies in each compartment was disintegrated into crumbs.

B001FA1SSM,fresh,How is cereal?,"Honestly, when I read ""100% organic"" and ""multi-grain,"" I had already decided that the cereal would probably taste like cardboard, with some berries added.In reality, this was a pretty tasty cereal that was full of flavor.  It has whole-grain flakes that are made with brown sugar, and you can really taste the sugar.  This was a pleasant surprise.  The flakes are VERY hard, though...some might call it ""crunchy,"" but to me, it was unusual to have a flake that was resistant to being chewed!  This took a little getting used to...but at least the flake is tasty.There are also little bits of barley in the cereal, and this adds a nice psychological touch.  You see those, and the cereal just SEEMS healthier.  I didn't really notice the taste or texture of them...but it was nice to know they were there.And there are lots of berries.  Strawberries, raspberries and supposedly some blackberries, although I'm not sure I saw any.  I've had other cereals with dehydrated berries...these seemsed a little more resistant to re-hydrating than I'm used to, but they were still tasty.There are certainly sweeter cereals around, but this one is pretty sweet nonetheless.  They worked hard to counteract the ""cardboard"" stigma.  So if you are a person who really doesn't appreciate sweet cereal, I would not recommend this.  If, however, you're somewhat like me and prefer a sweetness in your breakfast cereals, but also want to feel like you're eating something a little healthier (it does have 5G of fiber per serving)...I think Back To Nature Summer Berry Blend would be a pretty good choice.

As soon as I opened the package to brew a pot, my kitchen smelled of hints of vanilla (my four year old son even asked me if I was baking something).  If anything, the aroma is most satisfying when drinking this coffee, but the taste isn't too strong. In sum, this coffee is good because of its aroma and delicious taste.  I am certainly impressed with Starbucks' new vanilla addition, and I will most definitely continue purchasing this coffee. For a two pack purchase on Amazon, the price is quite reasonable.

I was expecting the clusters to be somewhat soft and moist. Instead, they are hard dry balls of desiccated apples pressed together into a cluster.They do taste cinnamony, with a nice balance of sweetness and acidity, but I would be hesitant to try these again. Vitamin C content is surprisingly low.. only 2% RDI per serving. On the other hand, fiber content is relatively high, at 8% per serving. This product is not for me, but it may be for you if you like the convenience of apple snacks on the go. The bag is resealable and easy to stow in a lunch bag. Same size as popcorn, these would do well while watching a movie or TV show.Lastly, it would've been more friendly on the earth and reduce its carbon footprint if these apples were sourced locally or even from within the US.

B003GTR8IO,great,How much does a coffee with excellent aroma cost?,When I got this coffee I did what I normally do with good coffee tried straight black no cream or sugar (which is how I like my coffee) and the stuff was good so good I might just drink it straight no cream or sugar. What I do normally though with good coffee like this is a mix it with some of the cheap stuff that I normally buy. I cut it 50-50 or so. To me it just makes this good copy last longer but that's what I do I bet a coffee snob who reads this will probably have a hemorrhage or something. But that's what I do and I like the taste.One thing I'd like to say I wish that coffee tasted as good as it smells (while this is close) coffee still smells way better than it tastes to me at least. If they tasted as good as it smelled it would be liquid crack!Thanks for reading Hope this helped! ANSWERNOTFOUND,coffee still smells way better than it tastes to me at least,"(640, 700)"
B004LA1LKI,great,How was the snack?,"First impressions: Package was easy to open - and by that I mean the individually wrapped cracker things.  You know how sometimes those plastic-encased things can be hard to open?  No?  Well, sometimes I have trouble with them.  But this took little effort to tear into.  I opened it up and:BAM!  That smell of cheese hit me in the face.  But not cheese - specifically, it smelled of cheese-whiz.  That stuff was awesome - when I was in college.  You know cheese-whiz?  I used to love spraying that junk on RITZ crackers on college while watching TV.But I'm not in college anymore.After the strong smell of fake-cheese hits you, a hint of wheat makes itself known.  That's the cracker part of these things.I pulled out the ""crakerfull"" only to have it come apart in my hand.  I'm not kidding - the cheese-like-substance isn't strong enough to hold the crackers together.  As I pressed down (very lightly) on one end, the whole thing flipped open.  I had to squish it down to keep it together.Taste: It tastes just like you'd expect: it tastes like the american cheese-whiz stuff on ""wheat"" crackers that have that grainy texture to them.  They're not terrible - but I wouldn't say they're good.  I had one as a snack, and was hungry shortly afterwards.  I would have originally thought maybe I can take these golfing which I like to do with things like this - but they don't taste that good, and they don't hold you over for very long.* I have no idea why the RITZ logo is on these.  RITZ crackers are utterly distinctive in their own right.  They have a specific taste and texture unlike any other cracker made in America.  These things are nothing like a RITZ product, and I have no idea why they would associate the RITZ brand with some pseudo-cheese product on wheat-ish cracker boards.-So, yeah, I didn't really like them.  They don't look like they're marketed towards kids - but they sure do not taste like anything a grown-up would want. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I had one as a snack,"(1196, 1216)"
B000FA38ZY,better,Is it the biggest packaging?,"~This is a `3 for the price of 1' review because 3 people in my house actually had 3 different opinions.#1 tester did not think he liked them well enough to buy a whole box. He said that although it was tasty enough, the cookie's chocolate coating was hard and cracked into small pieces when he bit into it, the graham cracker-ish crust was too dry, and the cookie was too sweet to eat more than one at a time.#2 tester thought that they were very good (not great). He thought that they were a bit too sweet as well, but he (being a typical teenager) was able to polish off 3 or 4 with no difficulties.#3 tester was the most impressed. He thought that they were over the moon terrific. He loved the combination of the chocolate, the marshmallow fluff and the crust. With a tall glass of cold milk he was able to devour half a dozen of the sweet treats. (another teenager)I received an 8 oz box (18 cookies).  The packaging was fine; inside the box was a plastic tray with two rows of cookies. All of the cookies inside the box arrived in tact and looked beautiful.

B000E123IC,delicious,How is the soup?,"This is a really great soup. The price is a big high, but it makes up in quality and value. The bowl is biodegradable and the paper that covers the bowl can be recycled anywhere, making this one of the most environmental friendly food products on the market. However, what it helps in the environment it does not take away in taste. The taste is very mild, which considered ideal in Japanese cuisine. You can dilute the taste or give it more taste depending on how much water you put in, but the ideal amount of water is the amount instructed to put in. If you added to much water, the water will not be as brown as pictured! there is not much veggies as pictures but the noodles are soft and delicious. It is a great meal for those who work at the office, just heat up a cup of water in the microwave and pour.  For the large males, it might leave you a bit of wanting more. For children, the serving is more than enough. On average, it leaves you feeling just right! ANSWERNOTFOUND",great,"(17, 22)"
B000FEH8ME,enough,Does it have enough sugar?,"Some of these types of bars are so dense and chewy that I don't enjoy them, and often the stated flavor isn't very evident.  The sample Pure bar I received had a strong blueberry taste and a great texture.  The packaging states that it has no refined sugar. If you do any research online, you will find that whether sugar is refined or not it has the same effect on your body so that shouldn't influence whether you buy this bar. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The packaging states that it has no refined sugar,"(207, 256)"
B001LG945O,not sweet,How is it the drink?,"This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda.  While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.Not recommended, sorry.

B0041NYV8E,odd,Are you able to taste the milk?,"I am a huge lover of ginger.  I regularly drink ginger tea brewed from fresh ginger root (very inexpensive, yet tasty) and tea brewed from dried ginger.  Both those things are good and enjoyable.  So, when I saw this product I thought it'd be a great chance to enjoy ginger in yet another form.  I imagined it would taste very pleasantly enjoyable...  DID NOT HAPPEN!  This is one of the most disgusting and vile things I've tasted in a long time.  It had an incredibly overpowering bitter flavor to it - so much so that I re-checked the instructions to make sure I had added the correct amount of water (I had).  I couldn't make it past two sips before I just put it down and said ""enough of this madness!"".  I let my boyfriend try it too, and he said the same thing about the flavor - gross.  I know that different people have different tastes and all, and maybe there's someone out there that could stomach this, but I doubt it.  My personal advice to anyone who's checking this product out, just don't!  You'd be far happier just making some tea out of fresh or dried ginger root, an option that's cheaper than buying this crap anyways.  Ugh...that taste lingers in one's mouth, too...

B005IW4WEA,satisfying,What is the quality of taste?,"I decided to review this product for the Vine program since I love granola, and I had never tried the KIND Healthy Grains brand before.  The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.  Let's start with the positive things about the granola, since there is much to like.  The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.  If you are looking for a great tasting granola, I would highly recommendBack To Nature Granola Chocolate Delight, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)or Nature's Path Love Crunch.  Both are much better tasting, and offer a better alternative to this product. ANSWERNOTFOUND",almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found,"(806, 862)"
B004LA1LKI,crunchy,How is the cracker ?,"Don't get me wrong - these are NOT buttery flaky Ritz like their regular crackers. These are healthy. Really healthy! So don't get all excited if you think they are going to be cheesy, guilt free versions of regular Ritz crackers. They are not that at all.What they ARE is hearty, tasty, high fiber multigrain crackers with some really sharp cheddar in the middle. The cheese is not creamy, but it's not as powdery as most ready to eat cheese crackers usually are. The crackers are a little hard, about middle-of-the-road as far as multigrain crackers go.What I LOVED about these crackers was their flavor and their fiber. Each individually wrapped bar has a generous 5g of fiber, or 20% of the minimum daily recommendation. It's not soluble fiber, but it's still a great addition to any American diet. Between the fiber, the 2g protein, and the 7g of fat, these bars wind up being really filling for only 130 calories. They only have 2g sugar, so the calories you're getting are good for sustained energy without any blood sugar spike. With a glass of water or milk, one of these would be great for kicking late afternoon hunger. (Those 100 calorie packs never quite seem to cut it, do they?) The flavor of these crackers is really good! The cheese is sharp and tasty, the crackers have a nice texture and rustic flavor, and overall they are just plain good.I recommend these for anyone looking to add some extra fiber to their diet, cracker lovers, or those who are seeking a more filling (and satisfying) afternoon snack at the office. Enjoy! ANSWERNOTFOUND",The crackers are a little hard,"(465, 495)"

B006J4MAHW,crunchy,Do you have some granola crackers?,"This stuff is delicious.  I love that it has whole grains, is non-GMO, and is organic.  But all of that would have been pretty useless if it didn't taste good.  It has only 6 grams of sugar per serving although a serving is a skimpy 1/4 cup, pretty standard for other granola serving sizes.  Fat, at 55 calories out of 140, is a little higher than I'd like, but again, I think that is pretty typical of granola.There is lots of chocolate taste.  In fact there is so much chocolate that when the cereal was delivered to me on a warm day after having spent the morning in a UPS truck, there were chocolate smears inside the package.  I do suggest keeping it refrigerated during warm weather.I would have liked a little more berry taste.  When I did get some berry, it tasted wonderful, but most bites had much more chocolate taste than berry.  It does have coconut in it, but I didn't get a coconut taste.  And although this granola tastes good as a cereal, I prefer to eat it as a snack or crumbled as a topping on a plain dessert.In the final analysis, I'm very pleased with the taste and ingredients in this granola and would happily keep it in my pantry.

B001EO5U3I,firm,How is the texture?,"I love the taste and the texture of these steel cut oats, but they can be somewhat of a labor of love to prepare.  It can take about 35 minutes to cook them from start to finish, with lots of stirring of the pot and keeping track of exactly how the heat is regulated on your stove.  I have made them the ""long"" way many times.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and the texture is quite pleasing.  I have also soaked the oats in water overnight and then cooked them the next morning which reduces the cooking time to about 10 minutes for me.  Still the same wonderful taste, but this method loses quite a lot of the whole grain sensation in the mouth.I was in the market for a rice cooker and while investigating them I noticed that some have a setting for porridge.  When I made my choice of the Panasonic SR-DE103 rice cooker it was partially because I wanted to use it to cook these oats.  The only drawback is that the rice cooker will only cook two servings at a time because the oats foam and bubble up so much during cooking.  Any more than two servings and they will be bubbling out of the steam vent of the cooker!  It also takes one hour to cook those two servings, but I can be off doing other things while the cooker takes care of the oats.  The oats cooked in the rice cooker have the same taste and texture as those cooked for the 35 minute method on the stove.This product is delightful.  I do add a tiny pinch of salt during the cooking time.  They are wonderful with either white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, butter, or just completely unadorned.  And, which is very important, a serving of these steel cut oats stick with me and I don't find myself wanting to eat a second breakfast two hours later.  One serving lasts until lunch time and beyond (if I'm really busy).  Any leftovers also keep well in a bowl in the refrigerator and warm up nicely in the microwave.  Just an all around great product.

The aroma is very pleasant, sweet and floral. The taste, however, leaves a bit to be desired. The aroma is promising you the moon and your brain is going ""Yes, yes, yes!"" and then the taste doesn't have the goods, you know? Kind of thin-tasting. I've had a locally-produced hibiscus tea which has a more assertive flavor (if not the incredible color). I'm going to let this cool down and make some iced tea later and see if that doesn't help this tea out a bit. Another sip. The aroma is heavenly. But the taste is absent.This comes not in a teabag, but a clever little synthetic-material pyramid for some reason. Very novel. Novelty is valuable. Really just the fact that this stuff is so different and comes in a little pyramid tea infuser would make it a nice stocking-stuffer type gift for the tea lover(s) in your life.

It's got a little spice in a creamy base but it just doesn't seem to mesh together well.  Maybe because it's refridgerated and if it's going to be creamy and spicy I'd prefer to have it warm.  It just does not seem to work well and I can't figure out what food this sauce would taste best with.  The label says to use it on Taco Salads and tacos and things like that.

I would urge you to try one of the other two new Taco Bell sauce flavors first, the Spicy Ranchero or the Chipotle.  Both of those were much better in my opinion.The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle.

B000F3V880,hot,How was the sauce?,"This is an excellent all-round product that can be adapted to many dishes as well as being used straight out of the bottle as a dipping sauce or as a finishing glaze.The flavors are clean and there are no wierd aftertastes from artificial flavorings.  The mango used is the fragrant green and red Central and South American Mango rather than the intensely sweet South Asian Mango.  The sauce is semi-thick and seems to contain a lot of fruit.  There are no arificial ingredients listed on the label.The predominant taste is a sweet honey, then the clean fragrant mango, then a mild hint of Habanero follows.  It is not hot as you would expect from a Habanero sauce. It would be too mild for a hot sauce afficiando, but still too spicy for a novice.  Out of 10 (1 being not hot & 10 being sucicide) this would rank a 2 staright out of the bottle, as the sweetness takes the edge off.  If this sauce were to be used in cooking (heat from cooking increases the hotness of chillies) then this would move up to a 3.5We used this sauce as a glaze over pork kebabs, as a dipping sauce for breaded chicken strips, and to make a sauce base for sauteed shrimp. The flank steak overpowered the clean taste of the sauce and so we added garlic, a half teaspoon of soy sauce and fresh chillies to ""beef up"" the sauce. This gave it a slightly Hawaiian twist.Overall a very versatile sauce than can be easily diluted/strengthened and used in many dishes.  It is worth a try and would make a nice BBQ hostess gift.UPDATE Sept 27, 2009:Over the past few months this has become one of my favourite glazes to use on grilled food.  It has been fantastic on skewered shrimp, scallops, chicken breast and even on a turkey burgers and turkey meatloaf. My vegetarian friends love this on their grilled veggie burgers and tofu.

B007JFXWRC,weak,Was the taste weak?,"Lipton is a household name in tea for a very good reason, and that reason is consistant quality. As with all their products, their blackberry vanilla herbal tea holds to that high standard. This tea has a smooth, robust flavor that is delicious both unsweetened and sweetened, and is delicious when served hot or cold. My personal preference is to drink it hot and very lightly sweetened to help bring out the vanilla flavor more. One of my favorite things about Lipton tea is that the bags don't tear or come open easily, the one brand I can count on to not leak tea leaf bits into the liquid. Great quality, great flavor, no funny aftertaste. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This tea has a smooth robust flavor,"(190, 226)"
B004JRKEH4,tangy,How was the taste?,"I tried the sister product, theTaco Bell Jalapeno Saucein August, and wrote a review for it.  Overall, this is a slightly better product, with better color and a better taste making the small difference.As with the jalapeno sauce, this product appears to be trying to cover too many bases.  It's ""sauce,"" which means it could go into anything, in cooking or in serving, so it seems to be landing as both a cooking ingredient and as a table condiment.  And it could go on anything from your breakfast eggs to your mac `n cheez for dinner, which makes it a table condiment for breakfast, lunch, dinner, any time.  And its ""bold,"" the American euphemism for something that's not really spicy, is marginally beyond the typical bland and boring that most Americans rely upon.  It's got the tiniest tinge of spice, but isn't powerful in the least; the taste of this product does not qualify as ""bold.""  Now, the taste ofCheez-It Hot & Spicy; they got ""bold"" with that one.The bottle's copy says the same as the jalapeno sauce, that it's perfect with ""tacos, Mexican salads and sandwich wraps.""  In our house it went on pork roast, couscous, green beans, Brussels sprouts, meatloaf, and french fries.  My kids (13 and 15) both liked the sauce and declared it was definitely better than the jalapeno sauce.The basis of this sauce is a mayo/buttermilk dressing-type mixture.  I don't know, but it strikes me that all of the Taco Bell sauces start with the same plain base, and the respective flavors are just dumped in at the factory.  The sauce is not chunky in the slightest, and squeezes right out of the bottle.The pluses in this product are the color and taste.  Where the jalapeno sauce faltered because of an unappetizing color of mayonnaise-off-white with mysterious green flecks, this one's smoky-creamy orange color is far more appealing.  It looks better in the packaging, and it looks much better on the plate and on the food.  The taste also is better. Jalapeno is a very distinctive taste, and those who know it and seek it out want that hard burst of powerful, earthy jalapeno punch, the chipotle taste is one that is more subtle, not nearly as strong, and as such works much better in this sauce.  The taste of this product is slightly smoky, with a good tang--not bold, mind you, and not even close to spicy.The sauce is just a bit too runny, though.  Yeah, it's in a squeeze bottle and it's got to have the right consistency to actually flow out of the packaging, but at the same time, it's a bit too runny when it gets on the plate.  Taco Bell needs to thicken it up just a little bit more to get it to the right consistency.This sauce is not bad; it does not taste bad.  It just doesn't deliver on what I'm looking for when it comes to spicy.  If I were starving on a desert island, I'd slurp this stuff out of the bottle and call it the Food of the Gods.Bottom line: ""Creamy"" this sauce is, but ""bold"" it is not.  Our family knows hot and spicy, and a lame American ""bold"" doesn't cut it for us.  If we want Scoville-graded heat with our food, we'll go for theSriracha,Crystal,Cholula, etc.  If we want creamy, we'll go for the all-American ranch dressing or straight-up mayo, and we'll leave this product on the shelf.

B005SPQENY,less,What is the quantity of sugar in terrific granola?,"I feel bad writing a completely negative review, but there was nothing that I liked about this drink.  The liquid portion was overly sweet (and I have a powerful sweet tooth, so it takes a lot to surpass my limit of acceptable sweetness), but that might have been alright if the drink had been smooth.  The vile part of this beverage, though, is that it has chunks of pulp floating throughout it, so you have to strain it through your teeth.  When I was a teenager, I bought a couple of bottles of a soft drink called Orbitz because it looked cool - it was an overly sweet liquid with tiny gummy spheres floating throughout, and after the cool factor wore off, I never bought another bottle.  This Chantea has almost exactly the same effect on me - from the outside, it looks cool, like an ordinary trendy healthy beverage, but the experience of drinking it is almost nauseating.

This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for ""this side down"" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew. For now, save your money. This stuff makes Dunkin's regular taste like a gourmet blend. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The coffee smells great,"(22, 45)"

B00934WBRO,light,How is the texture?,"I wouldn't say these are bad tasting.. they're just too hard. That's the same reaction I got from 3 people I shared this product with. I was expecting the clusters to be somewhat soft and moist. Instead, they are hard dry balls of desiccated apples pressed together into a cluster.They do taste cinnamony, with a nice balance of sweetness and acidity, but I would be hesitant to try these again. Vitamin C content is surprisingly low.. only 2% RDI per serving. On the other hand, fiber content is relatively high, at 8% per serving. This product is not for me, but it may be for you if you like the convenience of apple snacks on the go. The bag is resealable and easy to stow in a lunch bag. Same size as popcorn, these would do well while watching a movie or TV show.Lastly, it would've been more friendly on the earth and reduce its carbon footprint if these apples were sourced locally or even from within the US.

Instead, I discovered a foil wrapped, oval shaped chocolate with thin swirls of caramel running through it.  The chocolate is smooth and creamy - not waxy like some chocolates.  I noticed it has a very low melting point when I held one in my hand briefly and found it quite soft.  The caramel in the chocolate is subtle; no stickiness, just flavor.If you're concerned with calories or too much sugar, remember this is a candy to indulge your sweet tooth or chocolate craving so there's nothing healthy here.  6 pieces equate to one serving for 230 calories.

Still very sweet but it has almost a bit of molasses undertones. I love it and have re-ordered it since my original purchase. The sad part it that the price has increased significantly since I first bought it (from $18 to $24 for a 6 pound order).

B005IW4WEA,satisfying,What is the quality of taste?,"I decided to review this product for the Vine program since I love granola, and I had never tried the KIND Healthy Grains brand before.  The combination of blueberry and vanilla was extremely appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try, in a cereal bowl with milk.  Let's start with the positive things about the granola, since there is much to like.  The product is gluten free, has 750 mg of Omega-3s, there are no refined sugars, no saturated fat (there are 3 grams of fat total in a 1/3 cup serving), no trans fat, 5 grams of fiber, and has very low sodium.  The sweeteners include evaporated cane juice, molasses, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree and apple juice.  In essence, it should be the perfect snack.  Unfortunately, it was not.  There was a very mild hint of vanilla flavoring and almost no distinguishable taste of blueberry to be found.  In fact, the granola lacked any kind of flavor at all.  And the granola clusters themselves lacked freshness and tasted quite stale.  The overwhelming smell when you open the bag is definitely flax, and not the formerly mentioned blueberry and vanilla that was advertised.  So what I had hoped would be a new favorite granola cereal ended up being a bit disappointing.  I wish that the flavor itself could have been better, because the ingredients are just so good for you.  I will more than likely eat some more of this, perhaps in yogurt to ease the crunchiness and stale taste a bit, but I will not be buying the product again.  If you are looking for a great tasting granola, I would highly recommendBack To Nature Granola Chocolate Delight, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)or Nature's Path Love Crunch.

B001AHFVHO,nutty,What is the taste of recipes?,"Looking over the ingredients on the bag, I was pretty impressed.  Whole grains, no processed sugar, etc.  And at 140 calories per bag, not too bad in that respect either.  3 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein isn't too shabby, but with ingredients like quinoa and all the other whole grains, I was a little surprised that it wasn't more.  But maybe I have unreasonable expectations.The only problem was when I stated it.  The chips were hard, and my immediate reaction was that they had gone stale.  They had that 'stale taste' as well, if you know what I mean.  But with the bag just opened that moment, and an expiration date over a year in advance, I'm apt to believe that this is just how they're supposed to be.  The flavor was alright, lightly salty and a little nutty.  But this is probably not the best snack for children, as they will most likely not enjoy the hardness and staleness.

I actually expected it to be a bit thicker, like a tomato soup, but this was like a slightly watered down tomato soup. There were generous amounts of chunks of tomatoes and red peppers throughout and spices visible throughout (parsley and basil?). The taste was great. Not too peppery, tomatoey, or cheesy, but just right.The instructions were simple and the bag was easy to tear at the indicated corner. 2-2.5 minutes, as indicated in the instructions, was perfect for the microwave I used at work so the soup came out hot, but not scalding hot where I had to wait to eat it. I just poured it right into a Tupperware container and it was perfect.I think this might be a more pricey route to go for soup at lunch than opening a can, but there's more soup in here than a small can as well. The flavors for these soups sound more interesting and appetizing than a typical can of soup. It's also nice that you can heat the pouch all together in the microwave then just pour into a bowl.

Another plus is that the soup doesn't contain nearly as much sodium as Ramen, meaning it is quite a bit healthier.The miso soup variety is my wife's favorite. I enjoy it as well, but not as much as the not-and-sour variety. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The noodles are great by comparison to Ramen noodles,"(226, 278)"

So, when I got the chance to try the Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce, I thought, jalapenos may have a bit of a zing; lets try it.  Well, although the sauce is tasty and creamy, there is very little zing (hence the 4 stars).  Even my 3 year old liked it and she does not like anything spicy.

B00H727J6M,big,Does this kernel its big or small?,"Recently as much as I attempt to actively avoid watching Doctor Oz, he somehow ended up on my television one afternoon and it was an episode dedicated to the evils of microwaved bags of popcorn.  Did he make me feel paranoid? YES!  The next day I chose this popping corn because of my new found cancer fear (Thanks Dr. Oz!).There were barely any dead kernels left each and every time we popped the corn.  We tried with oil, butter and finally coconut oil.  Coconut oil was by far the winner.  The kernels were fluffy, white and large each and every time.  If you are searching for an American produced product, Kosher-certified and whole grain then this will be the brand for you.  If you are into saving money and prefer a larger quantity because your family consumes popcorn almost daily then this is not the product for you!  It is just too expensive compared to the other brands available at your local supermarket coupled with promotional coupons.At the end, it pops prettier but it tastes the same.  Personally I do not have a popper and would have to prepare this on the stove top.  It was a H.A.S.S.L.E. each and every time... It just takes too much effort when you want to snack right at that moment.  If you have an air popper or brown paper bags, you can microwave just the way you would with the microwaveable bags.  Sorry Dr. Oz... I am caving and buying the bags again.Recommend if you have a rather small family or require the specific points that I have mentioned previously.  For our family, it is just too expensive.  Delicious but expensive. ANSWERNOTFOUND","The kernels were fluffy , white and large each","(493, 538)"

I was so surprised at how well this worked!I, like so many other people, hit a wall around 3pm every day and need something to get me through the next few hours. I tried this drink with the expectation that I would either feel no effect at all or I would crash 2 hours later. Wrong, wrong, wrong. About 25 minutes after drinking the small can, I felt awake, but not jittery. I felt like I had a strong cup of coffee and could function normally. 6 hours later I was ready to go to bed as usual, without ever having felt a ""crash"" in my energy level.

B002IEVJRY,subjective,How is taste?,"I've had a few other coffee drinks that come in a can, with milk + coffee, and they kind of all have the same taste.  This illy branded one is no different.  It's a unique flavor.  Somewhat like iced coffee with milk, but still different.  I enjoy the flavor, but it's not going to be like drinking an iced mocha coffee with cream/milk from your local cafe.I would compare this closely to some of the Java Monster energy drinks that I've had, more specifically the Mocha version of it.  The difference being that here you only get 8.45 ounces instead of the 16+ oz of the monster, and you're only getting coffee here with no additional craziness, which is good.I haven't had illy coffee that much, just a few times in Europe, and then some espresso pods for a cheap espresso machine I had, so I can't really fully say if it lives up to the name, but it was smooth coffee, albeit with chocolate and milk mixed in as well.

B004BKHX1Y,unpleasant,How is that texture?,"NUTRITIONAL VALUE:Back to Nature Apple Cinnamon Oat Graham Crackers are 100% natural and naturally flavored (per the box). From a health standpoint, the ingredient list IS much more natural that most similar food products--everything on the list is pronouncable and understandable. The box claims that there are 19g or more per serving of whole grains in these crackers and lists the serving size as 8 crackers or 2 full cracker sheets. Following is per-serving nutritional information for those who care:Calories: 110Total Fat: 2.5gMonounsat: 1.5g (the other gram of fat is not accounted for that I could see)Sodium: 130mgPotassium: 85mgTotal Carbs: 22gDietary Fiber: 2gSugars: 8gProtein: 2gWhen compared with Nabisco Honey Maid Lowfat Cinnamon Grahams, these crackers have less calories, sugar and sodium than the Honey Maid Grahams. Honey Maid also uses HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) and partially-hydrogenated oils which these do not. These crackers are sweetened using sugar, honey, evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup, apple juice concentrate and raisin paste whereas Honey Maid uses honey, molasses, HFCS and dextrose.TASTE AND TEXTURE:TEXTURE: I found these crackers much more delicate than a standard graham cracker. There was a moderate to substantial amount of breakage from the shipping process. I found the dividing line for each cracker (within a sheet) much less discernable than a standard brand of graham crackers. I also found these crackers really dry--moreso than a regular brand. I'm assuming both of these things are because Back to Nature is trying to make a healthier cracker, but that's just my guess.TASTE: This is being sold as an Apple Cinnamon flavored graham cracker. For me, there was far too little graham flavor in these crackers and the cinnamon flavor was very lacking as well. The taste reminded me of a cross between bran muffins with raisins and bran muffins with dehydrated apples. There seemed to be some taste difference between the various sleeves of crackers.SUMMARY:If finding a healthier graham cracker is your primary concern, these may be your best bet. For me, flavor and texture concerns do not make the increased healthiness worth it for me. I have gotten some level of enjoyment out of trying them enough to write a fair review, but I would not buy them again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the dividing line for each cracker much less discernable than a standard brand of graham,"(1325, 1430)"
B001LG940E,refreshing,How is drink?,"This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice caoncentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.As to taste:  I was expecting ""Black Cherry"" in a dark red can to be strong.  This was mellow.  I could taste the cherry juice, but I think apple was the dominant flavor.  This tasted remarkably like a children's juice box or a capri sun baggie, probably because it's a mix of juices in which apple is prominent.  It tasted like real juice - not fake.The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.  At home, purchasing fruit juice in a bottle and seltzer water in a bottle and mixing them in a glass provides more options and a taste of carbonated fruit juice.  I used to do lots of carbonated fruit juice mixes, and think I prefer plain apple juice and seltzer water to this, mostly because the Switch flavor didn't strike me.  Which juice sits best with you will be a matter of taste, and if you like carbonated fruit juice, then this could be a way to make it portable for bag lunches, road trips, and such.Overall, if you drink a lot of sodas and like fruit juice, this is worth a try, perhaps in the form of one can on a road trip.  It's healthier than soda, because it has real sugar (from fruit, not added) instead of high fructose corn syrup, but not as healthy as a piece of fruit.Oh, yes, here is the nutritional information:8.3 oz.,  130 calories, 0g fat, 15mg sodium, 35g total carb, 33g sugar, 0g protein, 100% of vitamin C.Ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (Vitamin C) ANSWERNOTFOUND",Just like juice,"(194, 209)"

To shut her up, I let her pick out some stuff that I would genuinely try (the stuff we do to impress women, I swear) and either try something else or stick to it.  She got me this and FOR ONCE she got it right.I must admit, this hippy stuff isn't bad at all since the bran has a striking taste to Raisin Bran and the astronaught-style dried-freeze strawberries gave it a nice kick although those were too few and far in between.  I was very satisfied with the taste until I saw the nutrient facts and realized that All-Natural has more sugar than any other cereal I have ever had and, according to some reviewers, more than Frosted Flakes.  Fortunately for me and unlike Austin Powers, I not only have easy-access to a tooth brush and floss but my employer has just issued dental coverage as well so I'm covered in the likely event I get addicted to this hippy treat.Normally I put milk in my cereal but since my dreadful dairy beverage is filled with ""artificial crap that is filtered through more artificial crap"" (that and I got the 'look') I had to resort to the primitive, but very effective, eating method of just munching it right out of the box. Fortunately, the easy-access and seemingly 100% recycled box is not complicated at all to simply place my hand in, grab a small handful and carefully remove my hand and proceed to send the healthy snack to my ever-waiting mouth for processing.All in all, what really is there to say about an awesome cereal?

They have really big peanuty taste and the nuts on top are large and plentifulThey remind me of another granola bar, the Nature Valley Sweet and Salty Peanut bars. Those too are coated with peanut butter and have big peanuts on top. These bars are very similar to those and to be honest, I really couldn't find a difference between the two. One pro I did find was that the peanut butter coating did not start melting while eating. I did not find myself needing to get a napkin to wipe sticky fingers.While these bars are filling, it's also due to high calories and fat. This would scare someone from eating this as a snack everyday but they are good for a meal replacement if you're busy and can't take a break for lunch.

B00BIEU43K,perfect,What is grind?,"I really do like this coffee very much, though I will confess that it has been demoted to my second choice after I tasted another Community Coffee, themedium-dark Colombia Classico Blend.  That coffee is slightly less acidic, but both have a wonderful rich flavor.To me this coffee is smooth and bright, not really acidic, not bitter, and not terribly complex.  This might make it a little boring to me once I'm solidly awake, but to ease me into the morning with a healthy caffeine fix it's perfect.  I use the full 2 tablespoons of coffee to 6 ounces of water, and possibly just a little more than that.  If I use less I find the coffee to be weak, thanks to the low acidity.  Even if I use a little less coffee, though, there is still no bitterness.Even though I normally get whole bean coffee, I've found that this grind is perfect for my coffee press.I'll probably stick with the Colombia Classico, which I think has a more complex and interesting flavor, but will have no problem at all with this coffee if the other one is unavailable.

I like that it is all natural and was surprise to learn there is caffeine in it.  What I didn't like was the addition of Stevia. In my opinion, when you use apple, strawberry and banana, there is no need for the additional sugar. I would have preferred it to have less sugar.My friend split the can with me to try it and she liked the taste, but didn't like the carbonation.

They offer many different kinds of chocolate.  I would consider this just a little on the dark side milk chocolate, there is just a hint of the dark bitterness.  The taste is great and melts very smoothly in your mouth.The only reason I took off half a star was because the bar itself was hard and broken in many pieces.  I think the reason for this might be that the inner foil wrapper is loosely wrapped around the chocolate and can't help wonder if the chocolate dried out a little.

B005CT9OYM,moist,What recipe can be made with chicken?,"My wife and I usually use a crockpot for cooking chicken, but we were looking forward to trying the Knorr roasting bag with the seasoning blend. We tried the recipe for ""Italian Chicken with Peppers and Onions"" shown on the Amazon product page, using about a pound and a half of chicken tenders with a cut-up yellow onion and red bell pepper. It was delicious, with the chicken being very moist and tender, and the seasoning was very tasty and savory without being overpowering. We had the dish by itself and sopped up the juice with some bread, but it would have been great to serve over rice, with the juice dripping into the rice. Preparation was very easy, and the clean-up consisted only of disposing of the used bag.The package indicates that with two pounds of chicken, you should get eight servings. In my opinion, unless you have some side dishes, most folks will want more than one eighth of the chicken. Really, it's that good. The only thing I would change would be to reduce the amount of salt in the seasoning. The package lists 300mg of sodium per serving, so the whole dish includes 2,400mg of sodium. I would prefer a bit less salt, although the finished dish did not taste overly salty.This is definitely something to try for a quick and simple to prepare, very tasty and savory chicken dinner.

B001H3201Q,smooth,How is the caramel?,"Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates were delicious. If you like Werther's Caramel, you will like the chocolates. Although the caramel is not overpowering, when you first bite into the oval shaped wafer of chocolate is when you get an initial burst of the signature ""Werther's"" caramel taste, then the flavors meld together and the chocolate sets in and the caramel becomes an undertone to the chocolate. The chocolate is smooth and silky, however I would not call it extremely rich like a dark or bittersweet. They claim it is made in the ""Fine European Tradition"" and although it does not taste like a fine Swiss milk chocolate it is not a typical Hershey's or Nestle's taste either - I would say if Ghiradelli marbled their caramel into the chocolate itself rather than put it in the center that is the closest taste you would get to the Werther's Caramel Chocolates. One last thing  - when you unwrap the gold foil, the chocolates are ""pretty"" - the caramel is swirled in with the chocolate to create almost a ""zebra - like"" pattern, though that does not appear to be carried through the entire piece when you bite through it. Overall, Werther's Original Caramel Chocolates were very satisfying, and you don't need to eat the whole bag to feel satiated. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Caramel Chocolates were delicious,"(19, 52)"

B00DS842HS,subtle,Which is the most peculiar taste?,"My husband and I use a lot of organic coconut oil for baking and as an addition to vegetable dishes. This particular brand is certified organic and non-GMO. It has not been processed with hexane or bleach and it is cold-pressed. It has an excellent aroma and flavor.Normally I use Garden of Life because it comes in a glass jar. However, the plastic used here is free of BPA's.For those with allergies: The label on the coconut oil warns that it may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts.Coconut oil is a good substitute for non-organic butter and margarine made from hydrogenated fat (which produces inflammation in the body).Coconut oil adds an exquisite taste to almost any food it is included in, but especially curries, baked goods and homemade ice cream.Coconut oil is excellent for the skin. It moisturizes, protects and heals the skin, and it functions as a mild sunscreen. Its natural smell is heavenly, and it makes a wonderful massage oil. It can be used to condition the hair. When used as a mouthwash, the fatty acid it contains, lauric acid, kills harmful microbes, thereby helping prevent cavities and gum disease.We have, fortunately, moved past the era when consumers were wrongly warned to avoid coconut oil in their diet because it is a saturated fat. As it turns out, liquid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and, worse, hydrogenated, solid PUFA, which consumers were advised to substitute for saturated fats, are truly awful for the health. Among other problems, they suppress thyroid and immune function and spread free radicals in the body. Coconut oil, on the other hand, has so many health benefits, it is now classified by many health experts as a ""superfood.""Research has indicated that coconut oil is helpful in treating and preventing Alzheimer's, and it helps prevent epileptic seizures. It is protective of the thyroid. It satiates hunger so you crave less food when you eat, and it raises the metabolism so that the body is more efficient in burning fat, especially the most dangerous kind, visceral, abdominal fat. It raises the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.In addition to the fatty acid, lauric acid, that coconut oil naturally contains, during digestion the body creates from coconut oil a monoglyceride called monolaurin. Both of these fatty acids have the ability to kill harmful bacteria, fungi and viruses in the body. This means that if you regularly consume coconut oil, you are less likely to become sick from food-borne illnesses, flu and colds. It also insulates you from the effects of Staphylococcus Aureus (a very dangerous pathogen) and Candida Albicans, which causes yeast infections throughout the body.Coconut oil is classified as a ""fruit oil,"" and they are considered the healthiest oils around. Other fruit oils include avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, grape seed oil, and olive oil. Technically nut oils are also fruit oils, because a nut can, by one definition, be seen as a ""one-seeded fruit."" However, the reverse is not true of a coconut. Though a coconut is a fruit, is not truly a nut. A true nut, for example an acorn, does not open up when it is mature in order to release its seeds. Instead, the seeds are released when the walls of the fruit decay or it is eaten and digested by an animal and released onto the ground in the midst of animal waste. In contrast, a coconut has three pores or ""eyes"" at one end. Within these pores the coconut seed germinates and a shoot emerges from the pores much in the way shoots emerge from the ""eye"" of a potato.DISCLAIMER: I received a sample of this oil from Viva Labs in order to test it out. I was under no obligation to write a review. ANSWERNOTFOUND",body).Coconut oil adds an exquisite taste,"(644, 685)"

There is just the right amount of cadamom to give the tea it's unique flavor without being overwhelming. I tend to shy away from pricey organic products because often they aren't that much better than their less expensive counterparts (and I often recommend those less expensive alternatives in my reviews!). But after sampling this tea, I'd happily spoil myself by buying this blend (and hording it from my co-workers by keeping it in my locked desk). Excellent with honey for sweetening.

B00DBSG3K4,decent,What is the texture like?,"I looked forward to trying these cookies because I love coconut. The cookies are light and crispy and have a very good texture. They smell good, too! They are very smooth and do not contain coconut flakes. The ingredient list says it contains 2% or less of coconut, but it also contains both natural and artificial coconut flavors. I detect more artificial than natural flavor. They aren't bad cookies, but are just OK. Overall, the coconut flavor was disappointing for a cookie that promises more. ANSWERNOTFOUND",very good texture,"(109, 126)"

Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages. ANSWERNOTFOUND",little too sweet,"(75, 91)"
B006J4MAHW,crunchy,Do you have some granola crackers?,"This a tasty, quality granola.  My only issue with ""Premium"" granola is the price, but you usually get what you pay for.  If organic makes a difference to you, there's probably going to be an extra cost.  With GOOD little pieces of chocolate and good sized berries, I'd say this qualifies as a ""premium"" granola.  You'll know the difference in taste, texture and by looking at the chocolate and berries.  It's quality.  I went with 4-stars, because - for me - this granola was a little too granular and sweet.  I think this would work well for those that like their granola with milk (and on the sweet side).  I prefer mine as a snack out of the bag and to clump at least a little for easier (less messy) snacking.  I'll have to experiment with their other flavors, but I don't think the chocolate one is for me.  No doubt it's a 4-star+ product though. ANSWERNOTFOUND","This a tasty , quality granola","(0, 29)"

It has chunkier bits of nuts and fruit than the LaraBar also.This Blueberry bar is my second flavor to try (I tried the Cherry flavor first)and it is delicious! There are actual dried whole blueberries in the bar which give it a nice sweetness and very real blueberry flavor. In my experience, blueberry flavored anything can usually have a fake or chemically kind of taste but this does not at all.I highly recommend this bar!...and an extra bonus: Both my 4 and 2 year old LOVED this bar, as did my 19 yr old brother so pack these puppies as a healthy snack for your kids!

B004K0630M,not great,Is its taste good?,"Generally, I'm not a huge fan of energy drinks. I find the taste of most major brand energy drinks unpleasant. My husband, on the other hand, is an energy drink addict. We both sampled the strawberry banana flavor of Jamba All Natural Energy Drink and enjoyed it. Its flavor and texture are very nectar-like, sweet and slightly syrupy with a little acidic bite from the lemon juice. That little kick soon dissolves into a sweet aftertaste.While the drink boasts of natural ingredients (mainly apple and lemon juice and apple, strawberry and banana puree), it's no health drink: there are no significant vitamins or the minerals you'll find in some other energy drinks. What makes it an ""energy drink"" is solely the caffeine. The 8.4 oz can has 90 calories (vs. the 110 calories in a same-size can of Red Bull), 20 g sugar, and 80 mg of caffeine (about the equivalent of a cup of coffee).If you're buying on Amazon, Jamba Energy Drink costs $0.25 per oz (about the same as Red Bull), but Rockstar is a better purchase at $0.12 per oz).This drink is unlike other energy drinks on the market. If you're looking for herbal supplements like taurine and guarana, you won't find those here. But if you want a sweet alternative to coffee or tangy energy drinks, this is a good choice.

I tried it and felt a sugar shock coming on, with not much taste.  Hansen's Mandarin Lime is much tastier.  My husband, said ""Ugh it's horrible, why did I try it?"" and poured it down the sink.  Warning:  19 grams of sugar reminds me of the horrible orange drinks they give you for glucose tolerance test.  And what's with the rosin?  I thought that is for violin bows.

B003GTR8IO,bitter,How is it taste ?,"I have sampled various types of Starbucks flavored coffee over the years, and I have found that Starbucks coffee, no matter what the flavor, is usually very consistent.  Upon opening the bag and brewing my first cup, I knew that Starbucks had a winner here.I like my coffee strong; perhaps this comes from drinking it daily. In any event I found that the vanilla flavored Natural Fusions coffee produced a strong (but not bitter) cup of coffee. The vanilla is a nice balance to the bold Starbucks coffee and makes this a good coffee to drink both iced and hot. One thing I did notice, which I did not like, was a sweet aftertaste. The vanilla flavoring is not overwhelming, so I was surprised with the aftertaste. Of course taste is totally subjective, and others who drink this coffee may not notice, or be bothered, by the aftertaste.Bottom line, I would certainly recommend this, especially if you like vanilla ground coffee.

B004TPKAN4,resealable,How is it bag ?,"Ginger snaps are one of my favorite cookies, and frankly I'll eat almost any brand when I'm in the mood for them.  That's how I know that not all ginger snaps are created equal. Far from it.  Newman's Own Organics Ginger Snaps really hit the spot with me. They're not over-sweet, and they have a nice, peppery quality -- a lot of snap with your ginger.  They also have bits of candied ginger floating in them, so along with a good crunch (They're not rock-hard like some others I could name, though.)you get little bits of chewiness making the texture very appealing.Normally I'd go on about how there's no HFCS, the sugar and flour are organic, and a bunch of other things related to relative healthiness, but seriously?  I love this cookie, and I don't think I'd care if it did have a lot of crap in it.  No, okay, it would make me unhappy, but not so much so that I'd never eat them again.I'm really impressed with these ginger snaps.

Not crazy about the ""natural caffeine"" but I can overlook that.  Hopefully other favors will come caffeine free.One thing to point out-the bottle is much easier to squeeze than Mio.

The coffee was perfect this time around using the same amount of beans as last time. The coffee was nice and bold. It was not watered down and weak. My coffee snob husband even loved it. I ordered another bag right away. I am hoping to get another good bag. :)For the price, this organic coffee is good. We pay about $9.99 for half pound for higher quality for local coffee shoppe beans. Overall the flavor was full-bodied, but it tasted watered down. We used the proper amount of beans, ground them fresh right before brewing, and just didn't didn't get the zing I expected. It did have a nice aroma and finish though. the acidity was well-balanced.

B0014WYXQK,decent,How is taste?,"In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself.  But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water?  Thus was born...Soda Juice!And I tasted it, and it was Good!  Apple and Blackberry were both rather mild tasting; Clementine and Grapefruit a little stronger and more tart; and Pomegranate had the strongest taste.  I'd say Pomegranate and Grapefruit were my favorites, but I enjoyed all of them.In the cans you have 5 flavor choices:Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), andIzze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24).  The only difference between Izze in the cans and Izze in the bottles, other than the obvious of size and container, is that only Izze in the cans is fortified with vitamins: C, B6, and Niacin, plus the fact that currentlyIzze Sparkling Blueberry Soda (12 ounce)and Izze Sparkling Peach Soda (12 ounce) are only available in bottles.Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used.  Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit have the highest calories, 90, Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 80.  Apple, Blackberry, and Clementine have the highest sodium, 15mg; Grapefruit and Pomegranate the lowest, 10mg.  Apple and Blackberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 21; Clementine, Grapefruit, and Pomegranate the lowest, 20.  Finally Apple has the highest sugars, 21g; Blackberry and Grapefruit are next, 20g; and Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 19g.Note: as other reviewers have already mentioned, all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice.  All contain white grape, apple, and lemon juice.  In addition to their title juices Blackberry contains raspberry; Grapefruit contains orange; and Pomegranate contains clarified pineapple and cranberry juice.Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering:essn Sparkling Blood Orange & Cranberry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),essn Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),essn Sparkling Mango & Passion Fruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24),essn Sparkling Meyer Lemon Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), and essn Sparkling Pomegranate & Montmorency Cherry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24).  The difference?  The essn products lack the vitamin fortification, have a higher carbonated water to juice ratio, and have roughly twice the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of the Izze products, probably because they contain the fruit pulp, which the Izze products do not. ANSWERNOTFOUND",it was Good,"(322, 333)"
B005XVZKGA,pure,How is the taste?,"As bottled water goes, this product is about as good as you'll find.  The concern of many will obviously be the impact of caffeine on the taste, but given that there's less than a tenth of a gram, the taste is not affected in the least.  The water itself is clean and refreshing, and I have not noticed any aftertaste.The caffeine content is under 100mg, or about half of what you'd find in a regular brew cup of Starbucks.  You may notice a small boost, but it's not going to be of the variety that makes you wired or shaky.  I have found that it's a good drink for those early afternoons to fend off tiredness without having to worry about the caffeine/sugar crash you often get from coffee.The only issue I have with the product is its pricing, which in a 12-pack works out to about $1.50 per bottle.  I understand that caffeine has to be added, but 100mg of caffeine costs only a few pennies so that shouldn't lead to such high prices.  I don't mind $1.50 for a single bottle, but in a 12 or 24-pack the cost should be a little more attractive.  It has nice packaging and the quality of the bottle is higher than in many other bottled waters, but I would sacrifice a little of that to save some money.Cost concerns aside, this is a good-tasting water that also has some side benefits.  Definitely worth trying as a healthier alternative for coffee, for those in need of a caffeine boost. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the taste is not affected in the least,"(197, 235)"

B005VOOKMY,weak,Is coffee poor or is it the way to prepare it?,"I will preface this review by saying that I was positively disposed towards the company before trying their coffee.  They are doing a lot of things right.  The coffee is fair trade and organic certified, roasted in small batches, and the company has started a non-profit organization ""kicks for a cause,"" a group which engages children in soccer to contribute to a healthy lifestyle.  Personally I do not really go for using the name of someone who is unable to choose whether or not they would endorse the product, but that said, their hearts and conscience seem to be in the right place.  The coffee, however (in my opinion) is not very good.  I am saying this as a huge fan of African coffees (my personal favorite) and as one who goes well out of her way to procure same (since it is scarce in the Hawaiian islands, and expensive to bring in).  I have reviewed several other yirgacheffes which I have purchased here.  I would say that this particular brand is among the worst: bitter and completely lacking in the distinctive notes for which yirgacheffe is known.  Among the coffees I have reviewed on Amazon, I would say that the Coffee Masters roastCoffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)is the best, followed by equal exchangeEqual Exchange Organic Coffee, Ethiopian, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)and then Marley and Coffee Bean direct.

In fact, that's actually kind. I added cream, as usual, and the liquid turned almost white. This is a product packaged with no instructions whatsoever, except for ""this side down"" on the serving itself. Single-serving coffee pads have been around for a long time. I encountered them first in England in the early 1960s. They made a lousy cup of Joe and so does the Marley coffee--so everything old is new again. This company would do better to spend less on the fancy packaging and just put the coffee into a generic-type bag (with some instructions, perhaps) and allow buyers to build their own brew.

Boy was I wrong about this stuff! It's packed with sugar and calories.I've been scouring nutritional information on the internet to find a cereal with as many sugars as this cereal has. A serving of this stuff has an incredible 17g of sugars per cup. Whoa!! And it tastes like it too. I'm shocked that other reviewers haven't noted how sweet this stuff it. It has honey, molasses, brown sugar , grape juice, barley syrup and cane sugar! Yes, you read that right, SIX different kinds of sugar! It is so sickly sweet I could barely make it through half a bowl before I felt like sugar rush was setting in.Just for comparison, some of the sugar cereals your parents probably didn't let you have as a kid are much lower. Cap'n Crunch? 12g of sugars. Lucky Charms - one of the first that comes to my mind when I think of sugary cereals has 11g per serving. Okay, to be fair, we're talking about a serving here. I though, perhaps their serving was a different size. Those other cereals I mentioned were 3/4 cup servings. But even a cup of them still has less sugars.  And I haven't even started in on how many calories this stuff has (210 for those curious).So aside from the sweetness, I found the flakes to be overly crunchy and carboardy. The berries, when I had one (I had hardly any in the bowl I poured, my husband had maybe a couple) were fine. I haven't noticed any issues the other reviewers mentioned with the berries.I should also mention, the box is tiny. There are only five 1 Cup servings per box. It's pretty expensive when you look at it that way.I'm sorry to say, I won't be picking this up any more. Stick with Special K Red Berries.

But I was pleasantly surprised!  These fiber bars have a deep chocolate/coffee flavor, they are not overly sweet and have absolutely no strange aftertaste.  They have a nice texture, combining some crisp rice crunch with creamy smooth filling.  I would eat these bars instead of candy bars, because they taste much better and provide 9 grams of fiber.  They also contain no high fructose corn syrup and they are a more tasty alternative to Metamucil wafers, which often taste like flavored sawdust.Each bar is only 120 calories and is very low in fat, but you should be aware of the carbohydrate count, which is 25 grams.

Adding a few drops to water, one instantly has an artificially sweetened and flavored product which on the positive side can make fans drink more water.  Because it has virtually no nutritional value, it's simply an enhancer to water, which we all should be drinking.  I tried this in a variety of concentrations and found it to be the most palatable in a glass of seltzer, using about half of the recommended dosage.  It dilutes quicker than powdered products like crystal light, and because it's in a resealable small bottle, storage is better.  I'd prefer it not be colored, but I'm sure the market researches determined that customrs needed to see that their water was flavored in addition to tasting it.  I'm curious to know if this is usable in the prep which is used for GI procedures like the colonoscopy, where crystal light is recommended for flavoring.  In that application, I think it would be great and would suggest that it be recommended.  Because I prefer this to other instant water enhancers, I'm giving the product 4 stars.

The taste is similar to a kid's apple juice, and so I wasn't surprised to see that organic apple juice concentrate is among the short list of organic ingredients.  Organic, organic, organic.  The word appears 8 times on the back.  I don't think it really means anything.Nevertheless, the snack was very crunchy and very fresh.  They're a good size for snacking (about the size of a Whopper), they're not messy, and the bag is re-sealable.Buyers should be aware that these bags (60 grams) are rather small.  A ""serving"" is 2.1 ounces, at 60 calories, and there's four ""servings"" in the bag.

The bowl is biodegradable and the paper that covers the bowl can be recycled anywhere, making this one of the most environmental friendly food products on the market. However, what it helps in the environment it does not take away in taste. The taste is very mild, which considered ideal in Japanese cuisine. You can dilute the taste or give it more taste depending on how much water you put in, but the ideal amount of water is the amount instructed to put in. If you added to much water, the water will not be as brown as pictured! there is not much veggies as pictures but the noodles are soft and delicious. It is a great meal for those who work at the office, just heat up a cup of water in the microwave and pour.  For the large males, it might leave you a bit of wanting more. For children, the serving is more than enough. On average, it leaves you feeling just right! ANSWERNOTFOUND",is a really great soup,"(5, 27)"

We use a lot of hot sauce in our house and I have a very high tolerance, but most of my family like their sauces in the range of this excellent product.This does have vinegar bite, but the pepper flavor does come through very nicely. This is a good choice to augment the flavor of a dish, not just to add heat, so that needs to be kept in mind when adding it to a favorite recipe.Highly Recommended!CFH ANSWERNOTFOUND",hot sauce,"(143, 152)"
B007B9WAH4,nasty,What is the taste of this stuff?,"Have been enjoying this tea with the warmer days here. Easy to mix and toss in a couple of ice cubes.If not for the following two complaints, I could give this product 5-stars:1) Half a pouch is deemed a serving. Okay, 5 calories vs. 10 calories isn't a big deal, but seriously who is only going to use half of one of these tiny tubes? Most people don't even understand how little 8oz is. Starbucks serves 8oz short drinks, but they don't list it on the menu and people would probably laugh when they saw the size...just as an example.2) Advertising that there is NO aspartame is hugely misleading because it 'suggests' there is no artificial sweetener since honey is prominently displayed and listed. Yes, there is no aspartame, but there's sucralose, which is also an artificial sweetener. And WHY even have an artificial sweetener when honey is the very first ingredient listed?I don't get why it's difficult to reconcile such issues as the ones I've noted here.Like I said, the tea is tasty and refreshing, but those who make the product, package the product and market the product need to get real. ANSWERNOTFOUND",which is also an artificial sweetener,"(753, 790)"
B00DF0KXYK,delicious,How do you like popcorn?,"The popcorn is really tasty and not too salty for my taste--just the right amount of butter and salt actually. The packaging however was not great. Although the concept of the pop-up microwave bowl is a good one and means there is no bowl to wash afterwards it was a total pain to open without ripping it and spilling the popcorn everywhere. A ripped bowl then does no good to contain the popcorn! At first I thought it was just me, but no my husband had the same trouble with the next package. As long as you are incredibly careful and yet are firm enough to rip the bowl open then you'll be fine, but I don't recommend it for those with arthritic hands or for kids who will rip it and spill it everywhere! ANSWERNOTFOUND",The popcorn is really tasty,"(0, 27)"
B001OCBT3U,large,How is the bar?,"I recently got a chance to try the new(ish) Planters Big Nut Bars from Kraft Foods and I have to say that they're pretty darn good.  If you're into granola bars, these will be a little bit of a departure as you really don't get that kind of consistency.  These are also nuttier, and overall seem to be more akin to a nut-based candy bar like a Payday.As far as the pluses go, the bars have a nice balance of sweet and salty, and though the consistency doesn't scream granola bar, it's just chewy enough that it also doesn't scream peanut bar (like the various brands of peanut brittle-esqe bars you tend to find in vending machines.)  The peanut butter coating on the bottom also has a nice consistency and taste, not chalky or too sweet like peanut butter tends to get in products like this.  Also, at 46 grams, it's pretty satisfying, and I'd think it would certainly make for a decent small meal on the go if you're in a pinch.There are some drawbacks though.  Mainly the bars can get a little messy where the peanut butter is concerned, so I can imagine it would be a nightmare with kids.  The bars are also pretty high in fat, which isn't as much surprising (they are peanut based), as it is unfortunate.  At 13g of fat per bar (3g saturated), these really are in the category of meal replacement, and not snacks.  If you're looking for a healthy snack I'd stick with a more basic granola bar. ANSWERNOTFOUND",bars are also pretty high in fat,"(1098, 1130)"
B000FEH8ME,sticky,What is bar?,"I really like cashews and this bar has large pieces of them in it, which made me really happy. The bar is a good size for an afternoon snack or a pick me up while exercising/hiking at 1.7 oz. The ingredients are very natural with organic dates, cashews, cherries, walnuts, almonds, agave nectar and rice protein being the entirety of them. The cherries are a bit tart which helps give the bar a good flavor with enough sweetness added by the agave nectar. The bar is rather soft, but firm enough to hold. It is a tad sticky but won't leave a residue on your fingers. I really liked this bad. ANSWERNOTFOUND",rather soft,"(467, 478)"
B00AV5JCDU,not strong,How was the coffee?,"I've been looking for a good cinnamon-flavored coffee, and I've tried several different ones.  Some were better than others, but none had the taste I was looking for.  When I was offered the opportunity to try this one, I thought &#34;Why not?&#34;I realize that coffee is a very individual thing -- what tastes great to me may not float your boat.  But I really REALLY like this coffee.  The cinnamon flavor isn't overpowering, but it's there.  The coffee is smooth, with none of the sharp bitterness I find too often in flavored coffees.  I HATE the charred over-roasted flavor of a lot of coffees (sorry, Starbucks), but I do like robust flavor.  The key is BALANCE: flavored coffees should taste like coffee first, with the &#34;other&#34; flavor providing a highlight, not a shadow.I use the 8-oz setting on my Keurig K75 Platinum, and find that usually gives me the depth of flavor I like best.  It was perfect for this coffee.So for me, this is it: my new favorite cinnamon coffee.  WIll definitely keep this on hand. ANSWERNOTFOUND",is a very individual thing,"(270, 296)"
B007FK3CVM,good,How is the stuff?,"I really liked the taste of this.  It has a mild sweetness to it that's not soda-pop-sweet or fruit-juice-sweet -- it's more subtle than that.  I don't like overly sugary drinks, and the sweetness of Aloe Gloe was perfect for me.  It's hard to describe the taste of this; I think it's something you need to taste for yourself.  However, the nearest comparison I can think of is cucumber.  Trust me, it's good!  :) ANSWERNOTFOUND","Trust me , it 's good","(389, 408)"
B0014WYXQK,decent,How is taste?,"The Clementine flavor of Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice is refreshing and not overly sweet like a lot of the orange flavored sodas. It has a tangy flavor that is reminiscent of the Clementines I love, but the taste is not as strong as the straight fruit or juice from the fruit.One 8.4oz can is just the right size to quench your thirst. The fact that it is naturally sweetened without a lot of artificial ingredients makes it a good drink for those looking for a healthier alternative to sodas. It does, however, have a fairly high amount of sugar so it is not a good alternative for dieters. In addition, the juice's flavor comes from a blend of juices, and it would be wise to check the contents if you have reactions to some fruits or take medication that you need to be cautious about food interactions with. ANSWERNOTFOUND",flavored,"(118, 126)"
B001FA1SSM,much,How much sugar should diabetic patients consume?,"I have to admit that I loved the taste, but I suppose that's easy when it's got *double* the calories of the other 'flakes and dry berries' cereals.  The difference with this being that it's whole grain and sweetened with 'cane sugar' instead of corn syrup.  Also, the box is smaller than most cereal boxes.  This is only 10.5oz, whereas most are 16oz.  The sugar and carb count was very high with this cereal, so if you're trying to lose weight or have those types of concerns, I would avoid this.If you don't care about nutrition and only taste, than you'll like this cereal.  The flakes stayed crunchy even after being in the milk for a good while.  However, I suspect anyone who cares about things like preservative-free cereal, is probably a bit of a health nut and doesn't want to consume so much sugar.  But, the average consumer who simply sees a box made out of recycled cardboard with the word 'natural' all over it, will probably fall for the marketing and stay for the taste.I cannot recommend this cereal in good conscience. ANSWERNOTFOUND",is probably bit of a health nut and does n't want to consume so much sugar,"(733, 808)"
B007JFXWRC,weak,Was the taste weak?,"Being a huge herbal tea fan, I was thrilled to be offer a new variety of tea to try.  I wasn't disappointed!  I am usually not a fan of the berry ones because they can have a bit of a sour flavor; but this one was GOOD. The pieces of fruit in it are actually REALLY high quality, which gives it a really vibrant, nice flavor. And the vanilla perfectly complimented the blackberry and gave it a bit of a smoother taste.  I was so impressed by it that the next time I saw them at the store I ordered some of the other varieties of Lipton's Pyramind tea... all of them unusual and interesting.  Definite 5 stars on flavor!As far as the pyramid goes, I like that you can see what is inside the packet. And you can tell it's high quality.  It steeps much faster because of the design; and they pretty much have the same number of packets per package compared to most teas, so they don't take up more room.  I'm not sure that they will biodegrade as well (I was putting the others minus the staples into my compost pile; not sure I want to do that with these, they almost feel like nylon?)  I like the look and most of all the flavor and quality. Can't wait to try the rest of them! ANSWERNOTFOUND",Definite 5 stars on flavor!As,"(592, 621)"
B000VK3ZGA,fine,Is coffee good?,"At first I thought this coffee would be strong because it's French Roast.  However, it's extremely mild.  It has a nutty aroma when the packet is first opened.  The first sip has a mild nutty flavor, which goes away with each additional sip.I like drinking my coffee black, but can only do so with really good coffee that's not too strong.  Most coffees, I need to add non-fat milk to.  So, I first tried this coffee black.  Although it's very mild, and I didn't need milk to buffer the bitterness, I found it lacking in body.  With the next cup I added hot milk and it tasted much better.  It really needed the extra omph of the milk, even though it was non-fat.I didn't notice any heartburn afterwards, which is good.  But, I wasn't excited to drink it again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",good coffee,"(305, 316)"
B005VOOKMY,rich,How do you like the coffee?,"I usually like to grind my own beans but tried this because I had it once before and because it's organic. I tried it a few months ago and only had one cup and was pretty sure I liked it and wanted to confirm.I got this to use in my Cuisinart that is made for keurig k cups - I cut open the pods and poured the coffee into my set reusable kcup. Because the coffee is ground so fine, it didn't work too well in the keuring but I expected that. I just brewed two small cups with the one kcup-ful and it worked fine. The coffee is rich and full bodied, not bitter and only mildly acidic. And, it tastes pretty fresh for preground coffee.I love a deep, bold coffee but don't like acidic or bitter flavor, and this was a pretty good cupful, and it's organic to boot. I find it a challenge to find a bold coffee that I like that isn't bitter/acidic, so was pleasantly surprised with this. I would probably buy again if I could use pods directly or if I could get whole beans. ANSWERNOTFOUND","I love a deep , bold coffee","(634, 660)"
B005VOOKMY,bitter,How is the coffee?,"The first thing that hit me is that these appear to be a low-acid gype of coffee....I didn't get that icky feeling some coffees give you after you drink them.  That is a definite plus.  But the coffee itself isn't that strong either.  I'm not into Kona or really deep flavors, I like just a medium blend.  But this still seemed weak.  It almost came across as coffee-tea than a strong cup of joe.I don't think I'd order this particular blend again. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the coffee itself is n't that strong either,"(190, 232)"
B00110FINM,mild,How is the coffee is rather?,This coffee is so smooth and there is no bitter taste at all. It is a mild coffee with good flavor.

B004K0630M,not great,Is its taste good?,"Generally, I'm not a huge fan of energy drinks. I find the taste of most major brand energy drinks unpleasant. My husband, on the other hand, is an energy drink addict. We both sampled the strawberry banana flavor of Jamba All Natural Energy Drink and enjoyed it. Its flavor and texture are very nectar-like, sweet and slightly syrupy with a little acidic bite from the lemon juice. That little kick soon dissolves into a sweet aftertaste.While the drink boasts of natural ingredients (mainly apple and lemon juice and apple, strawberry and banana puree), it's no health drink: there are no significant vitamins or the minerals you'll find in some other energy drinks. What makes it an ""energy drink"" is solely the caffeine. The 8.4 oz can has 90 calories (vs. the 110 calories in a same-size can of Red Bull), 20 g sugar, and 80 mg of caffeine (about the equivalent of a cup of coffee).If you're buying on Amazon, Jamba Energy Drink costs $0.25 per oz (about the same as Red Bull), but Rockstar is a better purchase at $0.12 per oz).This drink is unlike other energy drinks on the market. If you're looking for herbal supplements like taurine and guarana, you won't find those here. But if you want a sweet alternative to coffee or tangy energy drinks, this is a good choice. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this is a good choice,"(1254, 1275)"
B004BKLHOS,bit different,How do you like the texture?,"I grew up on homemade andamaranth graham crackers, only having the Honey Maid at friend's houses. So for me the Honey Maid were a very sweet treat. Much like cookies, and too sweet to eat more than one sheet. My husband grew up on Honey Maid graham crackers. He thinks the amaranth are too bland and without flavor, I think the Honey Maid are too sweet and dislike the flavor of the enriched flour versus the whole grain that I'm used to. I was going to say that these were a good balance between the two extremes, but both of us actually prefer them to the graham crackers we grew up with. They have more flavor than either the amaranth or the Honey Maid, without being too sweet. They are the closest I've ever tasted to homemade without all the effort of making them from scratch. The hint of cinnamon is delicious.They taste fantastic dipped in yogurt, which is my husband's favorite way to eat them and bake up nicely as graham cracker crusts.Comparing them nutritionally to Honey Maid, these are marginally better in most respects, and a lot better in sodium content with 130 mg of sodium compared to 190 in the Honey Maid.The packaging is nice, and mine were in good shape in the boxes. The boxes are smaller than other brands, and the crackers themselves don't have clear cut perforations to break the crackers on. The flavor and texture more than makes up for that as far as my family is concerned. ANSWERNOTFOUND",andamaranth,"(22, 33)"
B003XDH6M6,great,How is the texture?,"I enjoyed these licorice twists. Being the first Organic licorice i will order, i was not sure if it would be different from the licorice i was used to or not. As far as i could tell there was no difference. It has the nice chewy texture that makes licorice unique. The flavour is also quite good.Being organic means it should be a healthier option too. I gave it 4 stars because my children don't like it. They took a taste and stayed off the entire pack. So i guess my kids must have noticed a difference but they could not explain to me what the difference was.So, while i consider it good for adults, note that buying it for children might not work. ANSWERNOTFOUND",nice chewy texture,"(219, 237)"
B00D9RRZ3Q,creamy,How about the texture of this chocolate?,"The caramel in these is good, but the texture of the truffle is similar to a soft milk chocolate, not the sticky, gooey caramel that you might expect from other candy bars. I think the caramel flavor tends to be overwhelmed by the milk chocolate. I'm a little disappointed by the artificial vanilla flavoring and mystery &#34;artificial flavors.&#34; I know real vanilla is expensive, but these truffles aren't exactly cheap chocolate. But on the plus side, there is no high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). ANSWERNOTFOUND",is similar to a soft milk chocolate,"(61, 96)"
B001EQ55ZO,tasty,How is the nuts?,"These are tasty.  The cashews are fresh and sweet, and the pepper is understated and spicy.  The combination of salt and pepper work very very well with the sweetness of the cashew.I tried these with a beer, and with lemonade, and for a snack before dinner.  They stand up well to a complex beer.  I also had one or two with a good Cabernet Sauvignon, and I am sneaking a handful right now.As a guy who prefers sweet to salty, these are addicting and really fine.  I heartily recommend them.  I intend to buy them.  They are gone! ANSWERNOTFOUND",These are tasty,"(0, 15)"
B000VK3ZGA,not strong,How was the coffee?,"Normally I wouldn't buy French Roast because it's too strong of a flavor for me. But because this was a low acid coffee, I wasn't as concerned. I don't suffer from heartburn, acid reflux or mild stomach irritation, but I enjoy decaf coffee the majority of the time. This coffee looked fine, but it didn't smell good. To me, the smell of the coffee brewing is almost as good as drinking it. There just wasn't much of an aroma while brewing or after pouring in the cup. I added cream and the taste was ok. The aftertaste stayed with me long after drinking the coffee. I'll stick with decaf. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this was a low acid coffee,"(93, 119)"
B004K00DGC,bad,Was a bad aftertaste?,"Only 2 reasons to drink something like this.  Good taste or a little energy perk.It has a nasty taste and an unpleasant aftertaste.  Therefore, you won't tolerate this and the lift in energy won't happen - since you won't want to drink this.It's not a complete disaster.  Served chilled, it's seems a bit refreshing on a hot day (the moderate carbonation helps).If you can tolerate (or enjoy!) the musky apple taste you might like this drink.  But I guess most people would rather have a cup of coffee for an energy boost (and iced coffee on a hot day!). ANSWERNOTFOUND",It has a nasty taste and an unpleasant aftertaste,"(81, 130)"
B003XDH6M6,great,How is the texture?,"Review of: Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists, 5 Ounce Package.This is a neat package of licorice twists.

ANSWERNOTFOUND",The texture of the twists is firm,"(193, 226)"
B001LG945O,refresh,How is the drink?,"I was really looking forward to this beverage, as I love tangerine juice and the thought the combination of orange, tangerine and carbonated water would make for a great soda.I have to say, it is different, but not what I expected. While it was different than a typical orange soda, I didn't find it THAT different, either in sweetness or taste. I probably prefer it to traditional orange sodas and I believe it to be vastly superior to many supposedly ""natural"" sodas, but I was surprised how similar it really is to artificially-flavored drinks. A bit more (maybe a lot more) orange and tangerine juice would be good. ANSWERNOTFOUND",juice would be good,"(599, 618)"
B003GTR8IO,delicious,How is the coffee?,"As a die-hard Starbucks fanatic, I feel like its wrong to add flavorings to coffee.  This is the 3rd (and final) vanilla coffee I've tried over the last several months.  Ready for something new and different, vanilla seems a natural addition to coffee so it sounded worth trying.  This is definitely the best of the 3, (see my other reviews) for 2 primary reasons:  the coffee is better, and the vanilla is more subtle.Made in a French press, according to the proportions advised on the side of the bag, Starbucks Natural Fusions produces a medium bold brew with a subtle, but not too sweet vanilla undertone.  The smell of vanilla is most pronounced upon opening the sealed foil bag.  After brewing, it is fairly subtle.  The coffee is smooth and not as acidic as some bolder brews I know and love.  The vanilla is enjoyable due to its lack of sweetness.Overall, a fine cup of coffee, most suitable for drinking with dessert after dinner.  It has been my morning brew for a couple weeks, and I'm ready to return to Sumatra blend.  But for those who enjoy a flavored coffee, this one is highly recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the coffee is better,"(366, 386)"
B000FEH8ME,interesting,How is the texture of this food?,"These are really delicious. The texture reminded me a little bit of the original Power Bar, but not as hard or chewy. Great balance of fruit it nut, not too dry, and has a satisfying crunch. Loved the sweetness level--you taste the berry and the nut flavor w/out it being too sweet. Decent amout of fiber (3g) and protein(6g). When I was done, I felt like I had actually eaten something (not like some 'airy' bars) yet is wasn't too dense to be a chore to chew. The reason I gave a 4 rather than a 5 star was the price. It's pretty similar to other organic bars, but my budget will usually have to go non-organic, like the South Beach Protein Fit bars. Yet again, these are pretty yummy. I'd say, if you can afford these, then get them. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The texture reminded me a little bit of the original Power Bar,"(28, 90)"
B004K0630M,less,Does this coffee less caffeine that the others?,The new Jamba Juice energy drink has a really light and refreshing taste that is not overly sweet and still has a nice fruity taste without all the sugar because it's made with stevia.  I really enjoyed this enery drink because it had just enough caffeine to enegize you without making you feel nervous or jittery and I did feel a lot more energetic. I would buy this product again to see if the increase in my energy level was just a fluke or a legitimate reaction to the product. ANSWERNOTFOUND,enough caffeine to enegize,"(240, 266)"
B001LGGH40,high,How is the sugar?,"This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice concentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.As to taste: This was close to what I was expecting, but surprisingly sweet.  I could taste the kiwi and berry.  The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.I tasted this flavor as well as the ""black cherry"" flavor.  I didn't like black cherry, but I liked this and would have it again.  If the concept of carbonated fruit juice appeals to you, thenthis is a good flavor to start with.Here is the nutritional information:  8.5fl oz., 135 calories, 0g fat, 15 mg sodium, 34 g total carbs, 33 g sugar, 0g protein, 100% vitamin C.ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (vitamin C) ANSWERNOTFOUND",natural all juice,"(32, 49)"

B004YV80O4,tasty,Does the meal tasty?,"What a pleasant surprise Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit provided! I was a little leery, having tried a number of boxed dinner kits that were bland and disappointing. I wondered if I should spice it up a little, but decided against it because I wanted to review the product without tinkering.Kraft supplies everything but the chicken, and there is a spice packet, but I still wasn't convinced this was going to be much more than mac & cheese with a few pieces of broccoli and chicken. WRONG!On a night when dinner was left to the last minute, I prepared the Chicken & Broccoli skillet and served it with fresh picked tomatoes and basil. Not expecting much, we were amazed how good it was, certainly as good (if not better) than a meal from a family restaurant. It is superior to the frozen skillet and microwave steamer dinners we've tried (and we've tried a wide variety). As for spicing it up--that's totally unnecessary. We both thought the meal was delicious. In fact, we couldn't wait to have the leftovers (which were still good). ANSWERNOTFOUND","we were amazed how good it was , certainly as good","(681, 730)"

B000VK3ZGA,fine,Is coffee good?,"I have a cup of this with me right now and am pleased to report that this coffee is quite good - smooth, mellow and surprisingly rich. The low-acid blend removes the bite and aftertaste w/o sacrificing the full flavor. It has an almost smoky undertone that I wasn't expecting. I would certainly recommend this not only to those who need a low-acid blend, but to anyone looking for a full bodied, but mellow coffee. I suspect this would be great with pastry or danish and as an after dinner drink. I made it using an ordinary, decent drip machine and it came out wonderfully. I like this coffee a lot.

B005IW4WEA,much,How is the quality of the fiber?,"When my one review pack arrived, I thought I'd have a quick taste just to see how it compared with the Kashi GoLean Crunch that DH has been eating to replace the decidedly NOT heart-healthy snacks that his cardiologist says he can't eat anymore. Why not? I could just zip the bag back closed. Well, I tell you, I had to sit down right there and pour myself a bowl with milk. Wonderful. And now we have something that can be sprinkled over greek-style non-fat plain yogurt, which he IS supposed to be eating more of. The evaporated cane juice provides just the right hint of sweetness without being too much sugar, and the high level of fiber will certainly be a boon to healthy dieters. The flax seed is an added benefit for heart health.My 60-year-old teeth are sensitive and weaker now than they used to be, so I often have difficulty chewing some of the granolas. This Kind blend is chewy and substantial, but not so hard that it's risky for me to try to eat it out of hand. Softened with milk, it's no problem at all. I'm not on a gluten-free diet, but I have friends who are, and this product would be just fine for them. The mix of whole grains has an interesting texture and taste, and the whole blend tastes so good I'd warn you not to sit down with the whole bag in front of the TV. It WILL be gone before you know it.Cost is my only problem with this product, but not because it's not worth the money. Healthy food costs more than junk, as it should, and it's clear to me that Kind is very healthy indeed. We're on low fixed income, though, so this would have to be an occasional splurge item for us, used more as a condiment on aforementioned yogurt than as a complete meal. I can stretch $5 worth of beans or chicken a lot further than I could one of these 11 oz. bags. I might, though, try it mixed in with oatmeal.In short: It's good food. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the high level of fiber will certainly be a boon to healthy dieters,"(618, 685)"
B00934WBRO,similar,What about the texture of the cookies?,"I wanted to like these snacks because they sounded healthy and easy to eat, a truly guilt-free, healthy snack. I've been eating them little by little over the last few days. I've eaten half the bag now and I can definitely say that I really don't like them at all. In fact, I have no desire to finish the bag.I definitely would not buy this snack again. Neither would I be tempted to take a bite if I found a bowl of them at a party.The package contains four one-quarter cup servings. Each serving consists of about a dozen round marble-sized dried apple clusters held together by concentrated apple juice mixed with potato starch.These round snack clusters are extremely crunchy, needing the powerful back molars to crush them. When I first did this, my mouth felt like it was full of a very dry crunchy substance that when crushed, gave off a dry powder around my mouth. There was nothing to relieve the dry feeling (no lubricating fat or liquid content). This was an odd sensation, and not a pleasant one. Even crunchy chips and nuts have a high fat content to lubricate them. I can't remember tasting anything before that was so crunchy and dry at the same time.After the extreme crunch, the next thing I noticed was an unusual sweetness on top of a very muted apple and cinnamon flavor. I don't mean a strong candy-like sweetness, but rather a sweetness not generally associated with an apple taste. Obviously, these clusters have been soaked in highly concentrated apple juice and the intense sweetness came from what I perceived as too much natural apple sugar. The final sensation I noticed was a nice tart after-taste that lingered after the snack was swallowed.The snack didn't taste bad, but it certainly didn't taste very good either. Personally, I did not like the crunchy dry texture, nor did I enjoy the unnatural sweetness coming from something with subtle apple flavor. The tart after-taste was mildly pleasurable.As an experiment, I grabbed a real apple and cut it up into bite-sized pieces. I tested the two snacks side by side. For me, the real apple was without any doubt the better snack. What I quickly realized in this comparison experiment was what the apple snack lacked over the real thing. An apple is juicy; the snack was dry. The apple has a very complex mixture of many subtle tastes; the snack was dominated by only two overwhelming tastes: sweetness and tartness. The real apple gave off a lovely strong aroma; the snack had very little apple scent at all, even if I stuck my nose into the bag immediately after opening it. Scent is a very important component of taste, and without it, the apple snack was just a dry, crunchy, sugar and tart taste.There is no doubt that dried apples are good for you, but any nutritionist would agree that in going from a fresh fruit to a dried product, a significant amount of enzymes, vitamins, and minerals are lost. I'll stick with eating fresh apples as a snack. ANSWERNOTFOUND",extreme crunch,"(1176, 1190)"
B004LA1LKI,dry,How is the mouth?,"I have come to like Crackerfuls, especially when traveling.  Just a neat and easy way to get a generous size snack while on the go. There are other varieties of this product: Four Cheese, Garlic Herb, Cheddar Cheese and Bacon and finally Classic Cheddar.  My favorite is the plain Classic Cheddar----I suppose my taste is rather simple.  The Multigrain does have a tad less sugar and a little more fiber.  I know taste is subjective, so I am only relating to my own preference.  I just need a snack at times, I want it to taste good and be satisfiying.  Don't get me wrong I would never turn one of these down, but given a choice it would be the regular cheddar.  I think my least fav. would be the Garlic Herb and not sure why, guess I just want to taste the cheese.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy these as much as I. ANSWERNOTFOUND",like Crackerfuls,"(15, 31)"

B008GZ1A7I,delicious,How is sauce?,"The instructions on the back of this packet are very simple: cut 1 lb of chicken breast into strips, pan fry it with 1 Tbsp of oil, then mix in the sauce, bring to a boil, and cover and simmer over low heat for 5 minutes.  They suggest serving it over pasta, and show it on a bed of vermicelli on the packet, but rice made more sense to me with an Asian-inspired sauce, so I made rice to go with it.The sauce is nice and thick and has a pretty good flavor, though it's not as...robust, I guess, as I might like it to be.  I think salting the chicken before cooking would have helped a little.  Cooking in sesame oil instead of regular olive oil might have helped too (since I was reviewing for Vine I wanted to stick to the basics).  My roommate liked it well enough to all but lick the pan clean after I'd portioned the food out, but his is not the most discriminating palate.  40 calories for the sauce for 1 of 4 servings, plus roughly 125 for 1/4 lb of chicken (precooked weight) and 30 for 1/4 Tbsp oil, and then any starch and/or vegetable you might serve with it, is a very reasonable portion size.Even though it's not amazingly fancy or super-flavorful, this is a great option for an easy, interesting sauce for a quick weeknight dinner, and I'll probably look for this (and other flavors) in my supermarket for that purpose.

She eats shredded wheat and other cereals I personally don't care for, so I considered her my primary resource for an opinion on the consuming side of this cereal. Her viewpoint was that it wasn't bad, but it was a bit too sweet.Looking at the nutrition label, I can see why. While it does have whole grain oats, ingredients three through five are sugars. That is why a cup of this cereal comes in at 210 calories per cup, which far higher than I like to see in a cup of healthy cereal. This cereal is definitely off the list if you are trying to lose weight.If you are currently maintaining a healthy weight and have the room in your daily calorie budget, then this cereal wouldn't be a mistake if you like it. However, Kellog's Cinnamon Oat Fiber Plus cereal ALSO has whole grain oats, and almost double the fiber content of these Quaker Oatmeal squares. It has less sugar. The only downside in comparing the two is that this cereal has more protein. However, it is more common to have trouble getting enough fiber in your diet than it is to get enough protein.I cannot recommend this product for most people.

First of all, PURE meets all my dietary requirements for food bars: it must be organic; it must be raw; it must be vegan; it must be gluten free; it must not contain GMOs, preservatives, soy, refined sugar or trans fat; it must taste good.These chocolate brownie bars are the best! I agree 100% with reviewer Tennyson E. Stead who stated so well that these are the ""closest thing I've ever experienced to eating a brownie fresh from the oven in a packaged food.""  Really!  A brownie doesn't get better than this! The Pure Bars are small but dense and quite satisfying although I could easily eat two at a time. They are moist, chewy, naturally sweet and have no added sodium. The chocolate is rich and not compromised by carob, the fruits are flavorful and sweet, the nuts fresh tasting. All the flavors are bright and nicely balanced without a trace of rancidity or moldiness, a problem I've experienced with other bars, particularly Larabar.The Pure Bar label is easy to read and contains all the nutritional information I like to see. I'm happy too that PURE Bar is certified organic and a supporter of the Celiac Disease Foundation.I am definitely going to stock up onPure Bar Organic Chocolate Brownie, Raw Fruit & Nut Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)on a regular basis because I indulge in them often, not just during hurricane season!

B004K00DGC,more,What is the effect of caffeine?,"I received one 8.4 oz. Can of Jamba Juice Crisp Apple Energy Drink from the Vine Program. Here's my take on it.It tastes like apple but there's a bit of an aftertaste-not unpleasant, but there, nonetheless. A can equals a serving, and at 90 calories, that is acceptable. However, it has a whopping 20 grams of sugar, and even though natural, it equals more than my daily allowance.Ingredients consist of apple juice, lemon juice (water, juice concentrates), water, apple puree, natural flavor, caffeine, green tea extract, extract of stevia and carbonation. The product description states: All Natural Nestle Jamba Energy Drinks deliver great benefits. All Natural (No artificial ingredients, no taurine, no glucuronolactone). Great Taste (made with 70% Fruit Juice). Sustained Energy (80mg of natural caffeine per can). Lower calories and sugar per serving than Red Bull.  While the taste is crisp and pleasant, I feel there are better choices if low sugar (natural or otherwise) is part of your eating plan. Plus it's a bit pricey at a little over $2 per can.I am somewhat ambivalent on this one. You'll need to weight the good ingredients against the high sugar and cost and see if it works for you.

B0026ZYZ7Q,distinctive,How distinctive is the taste?,"I've heard about pu'erh tea from a coworker of mine that just swears on the stuff, so I was curious to give this a try. The end result is that I was pleasantly surprised at how mellow this ultimately is, given that it's a dark tea. Most of these teas (like black tea) have a very strong and distinctive flavor. This does have that, but it's not nearly as strong tasting as I was expecting.The description of this compares it heavily to chai tea. It's been a while since I've drank the brewed chai tea, as I typically drink the pre-made Oregon Chai stuff, so I can't really tell you how similar this is to the steeped chai teas. This didn't immediately remind me of chai, but then my more recent memories of it are of the Oregon chai and that's pretty much a different beast than brewed chai. I did like the cardamom in this and it really compliments the base tea well.I have to say that I liked the overall taste of this. It has a distinctive flavor but it doesn't kick me in the teeth like some of the black teas do. I also like that I was able to steep this for a little longer than I normally do and it didn't get instantly bitter and undrinkable.As far as the antioxidant claims, I won't be able to back those up with just one box. That's the type of thing that you notice over a longer period of time, but I will say that my coworker has been drinking this stuff for a while now and swears by the stuff. Part of what she likes about it is that it's gentler on her system than black or green tea, so this might be something nice for people who find that these teas are too harsh for them. Caffeine-wise, it does the trick. It's supposed to have about 60-70 milligrams of caffeine, so approach this with caution if you're sensitive.EDIT:A friend recently gave me some pu'erh tea from a tea shop. I have to deduct star ratings because it was such a different tea experience and made this stuff well, ""swill"" in comparison. My coworker got to try a cup of this stuff and she didn't particularly like how it smelled, although she said the taste was well done enough, although not nearly as good as the ""real"" tea.

Served chilled, it's seems a bit refreshing on a hot day (the moderate carbonation helps).If you can tolerate (or enjoy!) the musky apple taste you might like this drink.

I added some red pepper flakes and chopped fresh basil and some leftover flank steak. With chopped peanuts sprinkled on top, this still wasn't anything that approximated the Thai food we eat at our favorite Thai place.

In fact I bet you could brew a few cups and use that as a soup stock. There aren't any bad flavors in the mix, although some are more intriguing than others. The ""Tomato Mint"" really didn't have much of a mint flavor at all, so I picked a mint leaf from my herb garden and tossed it in to spice it up, but otherwise they all clearly taste like they should.These non-traditional teas may take some getting used to, and people who don't like savory flavors where they would normally be sweet likely will hate this, but it definitely worked for me.

B000ED7M2W,full,Does hulled seeds are full of nutrients?,"OILS: Rancid is a process of mother nature and has nothing to do with organic, conventional, GMO or the type of seed since rancid has to do with oil. It is not important if the oil or the tablet is even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed, and I mean any type of seed regardless of the brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell, the protection is removed which will allow air and moisture access the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete un-hulled form. The best example of rancidity is brown rice. Place some brown rice in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if it was kept in a sealed container in the freezer regardless. Chia is the only seed that does not need to be ground in order for human body to digest and get the nutrients and can be stored for longer time than any other seed without going rancid. Sesame seed, flax seed, etc. are so dense that will pass through human body when not ground making it absolutely worthless since human body can not digest it in its natural form.FIBER: Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure, etc. and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy. Flax is high in fiber.MINERALS: Flax is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed; highest ALA, high magnesium, high potassium, calcium with the healthiest fat.Accordingly for 100gr servings size of;SESAME__FLAX__CHIA__AMARANTH__QUINOA__HEMP__PISTACHIO__ALMOND__CASHEW__PEANUTCALORIES565__534__490__371__368__567__557__575__553__585SAT FAT34__18__16__7__4__17__27__19__39__34CALCIUM99__26__63__16__5__0__11__26__4__5MAGNESIUM89__98__0__62__49__167__30__67__73__44POTASSIUM14__23__5__15__16__167__29__20__19__19ZINC48__29__23__19__21__83__15__21__39__22FIBER47__109__151__8__11__4 __41__49__13__32PHYTOSTEROLS714__0__0__0__0__N/A__214__0__0__0FRESHNESS: Fresh means nutritious and delicious. I consume lots of seeds, beans, grains, vegetables, etc. and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so I always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover. When fresh, food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form, from frozen to canned. Fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste. When old or rancid, nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price, organic or conventional. For few years I consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless; seeds are fresh, not old which means rancid, not in oil form, not in supplement form, not hulled, ground and consumed within few days, kept in dark cold temperatures, away from light-sun-moisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless. That is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil. I ground in my coffee grinder sesame, flax, chia, amaranth, hemp then add cocoa, isolate protein, soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins, minerals, protein and many nutrients, without much spike in my glucose. Un-hulled seeds are full of nutrients. I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories, absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed.OMEGA-3: You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase. Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either, you will only see EPA and DHA. ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA. That is true for any brand of flaxseed regardless if such flaxseed oil is in solid form, oil form in a bottle or in a capsule form. Greens, veges, nuts, seeds and fruits do not offer any Omega-3 in form of EPA/DHA since omega-3 EPA/DHA is an animal source. There are two major types of omega-3 fatty acids in our diets: One type is alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is found in plants the other type, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is found in fatty fish. The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA. There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA. You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega-3. Blood test is the only way to see the affects. I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseed is an important part of my diet since flaxseed offers so many nutrients. Flaxseed offers more ALA than chia for $1.99 a pound not $15 a pound, 22.8gr vs. 17.8gr. ANSWERNOTFOUND",hulled seeds are full of nutrients,"(3626, 3660)"

B00338DPRG,firm,How are pasta is firm?,"On Sunday evening, I cooked dinner for my girlfriend, Tammy.  I used the Barilla Whole Grain Linguine that the Amazon Vine Program kindly mailed me.  Because of the whole grain, it is reputed to be healthier than the regular Barilla Linguine [Barilla Linguine, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 20)].  But how does it taste?I bought one pound of scallops and baked them with olive oil and butter inside a shallow, uncovered baking dish for twenty minutes at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  Afterwards, I added the baked scallops to a sauce pan containing Barilla Tomato & Basil Sauce (Barilla Tomato & Basil Sauce-24 OZ) and allowed them to simmer together for approximately ten to fifteen minutes.  Meanwhile, I GENTLY boiled the Barilla Whole Grain Linguine for approximately ten minutes.  (I don't have to worry about the pot boiling over or the pasta becoming too tender if the water is gently boiling in lieu of fiercely roiling.)  I also steamed broccoli florets using my OXO Good Grips Silicone Steamer (OXO Good Grips Silicone Steamer, Green).The meal was very delicious.  I had seconds on the scallop pasta.  Normally, I don't.  Tammy said it was one of the best pasta dinners she had ever eaten.  I'm not surprised.  All of the Barilla pastas are delicious.  However, this is the first time I had used the Barilla Tomato & Basil Sauce.  Normally, I buy Ragu.  However, the Barilla Tomato & Basil Sauce was perfect with both the scallops and the linguine.When buying pasta and pasta sauce, whether it is online or at one's neighborhood grocery store, I highly recommend the Barilla brand.

B00DS842HS,subtle,Which is the most peculiar taste?,"My husband and I use a lot of organic coconut oil for baking and as an addition to vegetable dishes. This particular brand is certified organic and non-GMO. It has not been processed with hexane or bleach and it is cold-pressed. It has an excellent aroma and flavor.Normally I use Garden of Life because it comes in a glass jar. However, the plastic used here is free of BPA's.For those with allergies: The label on the coconut oil warns that it may contain trace amounts of tree nuts, sesame seed, and peanuts.Coconut oil is a good substitute for non-organic butter and margarine made from hydrogenated fat (which produces inflammation in the body).Coconut oil adds an exquisite taste to almost any food it is included in, but especially curries, baked goods and homemade ice cream.Coconut oil is excellent for the skin. It moisturizes, protects and heals the skin, and it functions as a mild sunscreen. Its natural smell is heavenly, and it makes a wonderful massage oil. It can be used to condition the hair. When used as a mouthwash, the fatty acid it contains, lauric acid, kills harmful microbes, thereby helping prevent cavities and gum disease.We have, fortunately, moved past the era when consumers were wrongly warned to avoid coconut oil in their diet because it is a saturated fat. As it turns out, liquid, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and, worse, hydrogenated, solid PUFA, which consumers were advised to substitute for saturated fats, are truly awful for the health. Among other problems, they suppress thyroid and immune function and spread free radicals in the body. Coconut oil, on the other hand, has so many health benefits, it is now classified by many health experts as a ""superfood.""Research has indicated that coconut oil is helpful in treating and preventing Alzheimer's, and it helps prevent epileptic seizures. It is protective of the thyroid. It satiates hunger so you crave less food when you eat, and it raises the metabolism so that the body is more efficient in burning fat, especially the most dangerous kind, visceral, abdominal fat. It raises the levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and lowers the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood.In addition to the fatty acid, lauric acid, that coconut oil naturally contains, during digestion the body creates from coconut oil a monoglyceride called monolaurin. Both of these fatty acids have the ability to kill harmful bacteria, fungi and viruses in the body. This means that if you regularly consume coconut oil, you are less likely to become sick from food-borne illnesses, flu and colds. It also insulates you from the effects of Staphylococcus Aureus (a very dangerous pathogen) and Candida Albicans, which causes yeast infections throughout the body.Coconut oil is classified as a ""fruit oil,"" and they are considered the healthiest oils around. Other fruit oils include avocado oil, apricot kernel oil, grape seed oil, and olive oil. Technically nut oils are also fruit oils, because a nut can, by one definition, be seen as a ""one-seeded fruit."" However, the reverse is not true of a coconut. Though a coconut is a fruit, is not truly a nut. A true nut, for example an acorn, does not open up when it is mature in order to release its seeds. Instead, the seeds are released when the walls of the fruit decay or it is eaten and digested by an animal and released onto the ground in the midst of animal waste. In contrast, a coconut has three pores or ""eyes"" at one end. Within these pores the coconut seed germinates and a shoot emerges from the pores much in the way shoots emerge from the ""eye"" of a potato.DISCLAIMER: I received a sample of this oil from Viva Labs in order to test it out.

It's supposed to be Strawberry Banana but I couldn't really taste much that I could recognize as strawberry or banana. But other than being a little too sweet it was ok. I can say that I liked the taste of it just a little, at least I didn't hate it or dis-like it as I do most of the energy drinks. I can also say that I like it better than Red Bull. It would have been better if it wasn't so sweet and maybe had some carbonation. As for its effectiveness as a energy boost I'll have to get back to you on that.

I had more energy through the night shift and didn't have that much of a drop when it was running down. The best part was that it gave me the energy boost that I needed without making my jitter around like a frog on a hot sidewalk.

In 1/4 cup of these nuts, you get 5 g of protein, 1 g sugar, and 5% of your sodium.  A serving is high in fat (26% of DV), but it's good fat.  Your body needs some fat, and the fat in nuts and olive oil is the kind you want to have, a nutritionist said.The nuts included in this mix are:PecansAlmondsBrazil NutsCashewsMacadamia NutsIt doesn't list on the container if salt is added.  I did see on a nutrition web site that sea salt is added, but haven't verified that with the company.  The container does say one serving is 5% of your sodium allowance, which isn't much.  If they are salted, it's very light.  I don't mind 5% as I eat mainly natural unsalted foods.There are no peanuts in these mixed nuts.  When I scoop out 1/4 cup of these nuts, there's about 5 almonds, a couple of pecans, and the rest cashew and macadamia nuts.  I'm not a big fan of Brazil nuts, so I let other family members eat those.  A serving size is 1/4 cup and the container says there are about 38 servings in 2.5 pounds so this should last you over a month.  It will last two months if you have the self-control to eat only 1/8 cup a day as a treat.

The first ingredient is water.  On the nutrition panel none of the amino acids, vitamins, antioxidants, enzymes & minerals the bottle says aloe vera contains are listed.  Just sodium & sugar.  The lack of any nutrients on the nutrition facts makes me wonder if there is anything what so ever nutritional about Aloe Gloe.My normal choice for aloe is by the brand Lily Of The Desert.

Although the caramel is not overpowering, when you first bite into the oval shaped wafer of chocolate is when you get an initial burst of the signature ""Werther's"" caramel taste, then the flavors meld together and the chocolate sets in and the caramel becomes an undertone to the chocolate. The chocolate is smooth and silky, however I would not call it extremely rich like a dark or bittersweet. They claim it is made in the ""Fine European Tradition"" and although it does not taste like a fine Swiss milk chocolate it is not a typical Hershey's or Nestle's taste either - I would say if Ghiradelli marbled their caramel into the chocolate itself rather than put it in the center that is the closest taste you would get to the Werther's Caramel Chocolates. One last thing  - when you unwrap the gold foil, the chocolates are ""pretty"" - the caramel is swirled in with the chocolate to create almost a ""zebra - like"" pattern, though that does not appear to be carried through the entire piece when you bite through it.

They love anything with cheese in it so that was a plus from the beginning.  The directions are easy and you can substitute different meats for the chicken breast, which--besides 2 1/2 cups of water--is the only thing not included in the box.  I used ground turkey since I didn't have any chicken breast on-hand.  I'm sure that ground beef, pork or cubed thigh meat would work just as well.  One recommendation:  Stick to the instructions to the tee.  When they say ""simmer & stir often"", they mean very often.  The pasta sticks to the pan if you do not stir it often enough.  I stirred about every 45 seconds to 1 minute during the first 7-minute cooking time and just barely caught the pasta from sticking too much to the pan.  The reason I placed broccoli in quotations in the title is that the teeny-tiny packet of freeze-dried broccoli once placed in the dish near the end of the cooking time becomes pretty much non-existent.  It is hard to see and it does not have that lovely green look like it does in the picture.  I'd really just call it the Cheesy Chicken Skillet dinner and not even include the broccoli.Flavor was decent, although a little salty if you eat more than a servings-worth.  The kids loved it, of course...it's CHEESY!  It wasn't bad for my taste buds either.  I was thinking that if I make this again, I might just add my own fresh broccoli florets near the end instead of the freeze-dried packet.The Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit was a hit with the kids...I'd just leave the word ""broccoli"" out of it.

B004JRMG98,delicious,How is the preparation of the sauce?,"I am giving this a so-so rating of 3 because the sauce itself just didn't jump out at me as being anything special.  It wasn't especially good, but it wasn't especially bad either.On salads I go oil and vinegar all the way so I am unlikely to ever try this on a salad.  However what I do use a variety of sauces for, is flavoring for other dishes.  In particular I often make a dish that consists mostly of lentils and brown rice which is quite delicious and made more so by adding different sauces to it for each serving.  For that reason I am always looking for new and different flavors to add, since each new sauce makes the dish different than the time before, keeping me from getting bored with it.In addition, I love spicy foods.  I don't think of Jalapeno as being especially hot - the only hot Jalapeno peppers I've ever had were the ones I grew and ate fresh-picked.  Nevertheless, I thought a sauce with even a slight kick to it would be great with my lentils.  I was a little disappointed to find that there is not even a slight kick to this sauce.  That said, it wasn't bad either.  It is sort of a creamy, pleasantly flavored sauce that didn't clash with any of the other flavors it was paired with.

B001EO5U3I,better,How can I get good bread with a good texture in this hotel?,"SHIPPINGAs was stated by many others, the shipping for this product is too hard on the cans.  Of my four cans, one was nearly undamaged.  One had cosmetic damage in the form of a dented side.  The other two were dented to the extent of having sharp creases in the bottom and flaws near the seal lines at the top.  I never buy cans like those at the supermarket.COOKINGThe cooking went much better than I expected.  The evening before, I put 1/4 cup chopped black walnuts, 10 pitted prunes cut into pieces with scissors, and two cups of water into my saucepan.  I brought this mixture to a boil over a simmering-level flame on my propane stove.  I dumped in one-half-cup of McCann's steel cut oats and stirred.  I waited for the mixture to come to a boil again, stirred it a little, turned off the flame, put a lid on the saucepan, and went to bed.  In the morning I was surprised to find that it was perfectly edible with no further cooking.  I did heat it up again on the stove before serving but it stuck to the pot, so I think in the future I will microwave it right in the bowls just before serving it.EATINGThese oats were good, but it was hard to say if they were ""nuttier"" in flavor than the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats which I had been eating because I cooked them both with nuts.  The texture was of course firmer.  I do like bulgar wheat and these oats are more like that in texture.  Since I was careful not to overcook the rolled oats, there was not much difference in the ""slime"" feel of the two, but the rolled oats were papery much like eating raw oatmeal cookie dough.NUTRITIONI found little difference between the nutritional content listed on the McCann steel cut can and that listed on the Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats container.  I had to do some Internet research to find the differences which turn out to be subtle but important for certain types of health conditions.  There is also the likelihood of the product simply being fresher due to less processing and better packaging at the mill.REPEAT PURCHASENow that I have found that the cooking of steel cut oats is much less intimidating than I had imagined, I will probably eat these in preferance to rolled oats in the future.  The possibility of adding them to soups and other cooked entrees in place of barley or bulgar wheat is a bonus.  However, I will probably try a more economical source as I am not convinced that Ireland's soil is superior to that in any other region in which oats are farmed, and metal cans with sharp creases and bent seams don't seem worth the extra cost. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The texture was of course firmer,"(1288, 1320)"
B000FEH8ME,nutty,How is the taste?,"This bar was actually not as terrible as I thought it would be - I had tried another all natural fruit bar recently that tasted like a compost pile, so this was actually refreshing.  It should be called ""Pure Bar Organic Wild DATE"" because it tastes and has a texture like dried dates (which is fine, I like dried dates) with a hint of blueberry.  It does smell blueberry-ish though.  The first few bites were really good and I kept thinking that it reminded me of eating a fruit roll up... but maybe having 70 of them smashed together and eating it in one bite... a kids dream.  I didn't like the nuts in the bar.  I probably would have preferred it if it was a fruit only bar, for some reason the nuts threw me off and I got about half way through and lost interest.  My husband had a few bites and also had a similar reaction.Not sure how much energy I'd derive from it compared to other food bars, but even as a processed packaged food, it tastes light years better than most of the other bars I've tried.

B004TPKAN4,empty,Does the bag have things inside?,"Newman's Own and I have had a really good relationship thus far; I have at least liked, and most usually loved, every product I have tried from them. Their organic ginger snaps are no exception. The cookies are relatively small (somewhere between 1-1/2 to 2 inches in diameter), but they are filled to the brim with gingery goodness, which you would hope for in a ginger snap. I wouldn't think these would be for someone with a casual liking of ginger, but for those who enjoy it more, these are sure to please as far as flavor goes. As for the crunch, these are a hard cookie and not for those with gentle teeth, but they are, after all, a ginger snap. Ginger snaps are not known to be soft in any way, shape, or form. Rest assured that these won't break in shipment. My bag of cookies survived their journey even though they came in a soft envelope, which in turn was crammed into my cluster mailbox. However, when I opened the bag, I only found two broken pieces equaling a cookie. That's one tough cookie!As far as nutrition goes, it's pretty good: 5 cookies in a serving, 130 calories (30 from fat), saturated fat 1.5 grams, sugar is 12 grams (not great but it is a cookie so far better than most other choices). The ingredients in order: Organic Unbleached Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Molasses, Organic Palm Fruit Oil, Candied Ginger (ginger, sugar), Ground Ginger, Salt, Leavening (sodium bicarbonate, monocalcium, phosphate), Soy Lecithin, Spice. While these claim to be Vegan, I see that it doesn't say 'organic sugar' listed in the ingredients to the candied sugar, just 'sugar', so one wonders about that. If you're unfamiliar with the Newman's Own brand, it was co-founded by Paul Newman as a company where all profits from their food items go to various charities after taxes. It's a great cause that has fantastic, healthy, and quality products that while may be a bit pricier than other brands, won't break the bank.A little note, you might want to have a glass of milk, or cup of tea or coffee hanging around, because these ginger snaps really do snap back!

B0051COPFI,perfect,How is the texture of the product?,"Although I do prefer baby food products in jars, because I reuse them for many things, I have to say that the Baby Gourmet Organic Simple Purees Stage 1 Juicy Pear and Garden Greens Baby Food is one that I will buy despite the lack of jars.The texture is just right- not too runny, not too thick, and the color is very natural- shows a lack of manipulation or alteration.  The taste is absolutely perfect.  The food is very sweet like fruit is but not artificially so.  The greens are in the perfect balance.  Not too much to be overbearing, but the pear fruit taste balances it out perfectly. It was gobbled right up!The container is very interesting- it is flat with that screw on top.  The top has a seal on it, and is very easy to remove, but not so much that it will come off if you have to transport it.  Once you open it, the spout is easy to get the food out of, and then if you need to re-cap it, you can do so and keep the rest until the next day.I doubt that this food would last that long, however. It is so delicious that it will be finished most likely.  The packet is also fairly easy to get most of the food out of too, leaving little waste.This food is so good that my entire family right up to Daddy kept trying to eat it all instead!  It would make a great snack for traveling even for plder kids on the go (even moms).  Just enough for an energy boost and a great little snack.I can not recommend this food highly enough.

Compared to other snacks like Cheez-Its, the cheese flavoring is definitely mild. I'd recommend this more for popcorn fans than for fans of cheese.To be quite honest, I didn't pay attention to the nutritional contents of this snack, but it's white cheddar popcorn - it can't be good. While the popcorn was tasty, I don't know if I'd say it was tasty enough to justify the fat contents. Also, it isn't particularly filling, so if you have a big craving this might not fill it.

Its not salty and doesnt leave any sticky residue on your fingers. Its alittle too crunchy and occasionally you run into uneatable bits of popcorn, which may be normal in regular popcorn but really shouldnt be in a sweet snack.Health: Each pack in the box has 130 calories, with 3g Fat, 24g Carbs, 18g Sugars.Verdict: There are healthier snacks that are cheaper than this but if you like popcorn, fudge, and caramel give it a try.

I'm tasting a variety of flavors but most prominent is a tomato base with some spiciness. It's also a unique and handy way to package soup. The bag makes it lightweight, easy to carry, and simple to heat. It also takes up less space and it's nice to be able to microwave it in the bag. The only downside it that the plastic bag is less durable although I'm not sure what you would be doing with a bag of soup that might actually puncture it.

B003YBLF2E,strange,How's the texture?,"When I ordered this GoPicnic set, I thought all I was getting was the crackers and salmon spread, but to my delight, it's a full lunch set. You get the crackers and spread, dried edamame, ginger nuts and dried fruit, and a little organic chocolate. For the most part, I thought this was really tasty. The salmon spread does taste like salmon, which is great, and the lime and chili complement it well. It's just a tad spicy, so mild that I didn't even notice it until I was well into eating it. I liked the slight kick, and it shouldn't bother people with sensative tongues. The crackers are organic, but you wouldn't know it. They're crunchy and buttery, kind of like Ritz crackers. My favorite item was the fruit and nut mix. They were salty and sweet, and the ginger went so well with the nuts peanuts and cranberries. It had a slight kick, no more than the salmon spread, and this was a great complement. The chocolate was ok. If you've had organic chocolate before, you know what to expect. It wasn't very sweet at 60% cacao, and it wasn't very smooth. Not really my thing, but eh. The only thing I didn't really like was the dried edamame. I generally like edamame, but dried... the first few bites were good. I liked the dry, almost flaky texture. But after a few bites, it tasted a bit weird.This has 16g of fat (25% of your daily value), but only 5g of saturated fat (25% daily value), most of which come from the salmon spread. There are 410 calories and 150 calories from fat.There are only 10mg cholesterol (3% daily value). There are 48g of carbohydrates (16% daily value) and 11g dietary fiber (44% daily value). The sodium isn't bad at 660mg (28% daily value), and neither are the sugars at 21g. The biggest problem is that there's not a whole lot of nutritional value here. You get 22g protien, which is pretty good, but only 10% of your daily value for iron and vitamin C. Fish has plenty of omega-3s, though, and peanuts and cranberries are full of anti-oxidants, so that's something.The packaging is very nice. I love the colors and design, especially the blue gingham pattern on the top. On the inside, there are fun facts and even a sudoku puzzle for you to complete. It's easy to open, and everything comes in its own easy to open packaging. There's a plastic fork for you to use, though I didn't need it. It doesn't all seem biodegradeable, though, and some might not like that.Overall, this was a very tasty lunch set. It was pretty filling and not bad for you. A great alternative to things like Lunchables, which are just full of sodium. Recommended! ANSWERNOTFOUND",almost flaky texture,"(1233, 1253)"

There is no trans fat, but there is 10% of your daily fat and sodium intake in this one snack.The taste is decent, but instead of the cheese spread a peanut butter or jelly type spread would work just as well and would probably lower the fat content.I would personally suggest a PB&J; on multigrain bread for a far healthier and less expensive snack.

The second time I just made some holes in the chicken with a fork, poured the sauce over it, and stuck it in the oven. Either way, the chicken came out very good.

It cooks very well (no longer than any traditional wheat pastas), holds up well with sauce, and doesn't completely fall apart if you re-heat it and stir it - this particular shape will lose a few twirls if you stir vigorously (I wanted to test it!), but not anywhere near what other GF pastas do!

This has to stop somewhere, right?I was hoping these would do the trick and they certainly came through for me. One box includes 3 wax paper wrapped packages. The crackers are crispy but not too crumbly. The size is good for tossing 3 large crackers into a bag for a school snack or adding Nutella in between layers to create a great after school snack.

And indeed, the pasta inside is as good as if I had cooked it fresh on the stove.The meat sauce was ok but of course not up to par with something you would make yourself or heat from a jar. However, it wasn't bad. It is a bit bland and does have a few tiny pieces of meat in it. It could use an addition of onion and garlic, and yet, in the right circumstances, such as needing a quick inexpensive meal, this would certainly be filling and, if not exactly scrumptuous, still decently tastey that you wouldn't mind eating it.

It's definitely acceptible.In short, keep a few of these in your cupboard, or take on your next trip if you will have a microwave, and have a quick pasta meal when you need it.

The water turns a brillant purplish maroon color very pretty.I usually drink my tea with sugar, but I started this one off with no sugar just to see what the original flavor would be. It is slightly sweet and instantly I get the taste of blackberry the vanilla is more subtle but when I smell the tea I can smell both the blackberry and vanilla.

But I did add sugar as well and it really does bring out the flavor more and taste good that way as well. But this is one of those teas I can drink with or without sugar. Regular lipton tea I have to drink with sugar.This tea can be drank hot or cold. I am only drinking it hot but I think cold would be excellent as well. You just brew it like you are having hot tea and then chill or add ice.The ingredients shows there is also hibiscus flowers, rosehips, sweet blackberry leaves, natural flavor, dried black current pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces, dried raspberry pieces, sunflower lecithin.Overall I am very pleased with the taste. It makes me want to try other flavors of lipton pyramid teas. Can really taste the blackberry and a bit of raspberry and with added sugar I can taste more of the vanilla as well.

B004BKLHOS,bit different,How do you like the texture?,"I grew up on homemade andamaranth graham crackers, only having the Honey Maid at friend's houses. So for me the Honey Maid were a very sweet treat. Much like cookies, and too sweet to eat more than one sheet. My husband grew up on Honey Maid graham crackers. He thinks the amaranth are too bland and without flavor, I think the Honey Maid are too sweet and dislike the flavor of the enriched flour versus the whole grain that I'm used to. I was going to say that these were a good balance between the two extremes, but both of us actually prefer them to the graham crackers we grew up with. They have more flavor than either the amaranth or the Honey Maid, without being too sweet. They are the closest I've ever tasted to homemade without all the effort of making them from scratch. The hint of cinnamon is delicious.They taste fantastic dipped in yogurt, which is my husband's favorite way to eat them and bake up nicely as graham cracker crusts.Comparing them nutritionally to Honey Maid, these are marginally better in most respects, and a lot better in sodium content with 130 mg of sodium compared to 190 in the Honey Maid.The packaging is nice, and mine were in good shape in the boxes. The boxes are smaller than other brands, and the crackers themselves don't have clear cut perforations to break the crackers on. The flavor and texture more than makes up for that as far as my family is concerned. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The flavor and texture more than makes up for that as far as my family is concerned,"(1323, 1406)"

B002IEVJRY,enough,Is sugar enough?,"Okay, I admit that I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says ""100% natural arabica"". Not sure what the ""natural"" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak ""natural"" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the ""arabica"" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand.

B0014WYXQK,decent,How is taste?,"The Clementine flavor of Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice is refreshing and not overly sweet like a lot of the orange flavored sodas. It has a tangy flavor that is reminiscent of the Clementines I love, but the taste is not as strong as the straight fruit or juice from the fruit.One 8.4oz can is just the right size to quench your thirst. The fact that it is naturally sweetened without a lot of artificial ingredients makes it a good drink for those looking for a healthier alternative to sodas. It does, however, have a fairly high amount of sugar so it is not a good alternative for dieters. In addition, the juice's flavor comes from a blend of juices, and it would be wise to check the contents if you have reactions to some fruits or take medication that you need to be cautious about food interactions with. ANSWERNOTFOUND",It has a tangy flavor,"(134, 155)"
B001LG940E,fair,What amount of minerals and vitamins present in this ?,"I tried this The Switch Black Cherry flavor as well as the Watermelon Strawberry.  I happen to like black cherry as a flavor for beverages, so keep that in mind as you read this review.FLAVOR:The beverage was sweet, but not overly sweet, and not at all tart.  It tasted similar to other black cherry carbonated drinks I've had.  I would compare it in taste to Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer with Switch being a tad more ""soda"" tasting.  It is much lighter tasting than actual black cherry sodas I've had, such as Dr. Brown's.INGREDIENTS:The Switch is advertised as 100% juice.  It is, but it is juice from concentrate.  I prefer juice squeezed from the fruit or vegetable itself.  In the case of The Switch the concentrate is filtered sparkling water.  I'm fine drinking concentrates and I drink soda too so I'm not being a health fanatic, but be aware if you are expecting actual juice, this product is filtered water used to reconstitute the juice concentrate.  The juices uses are apple, grape, acerola and cherry.  If you aren't familiar with acerola, it is a cherry like fruit, but with three lobes.  Acerola is high in Vitamin C.NUTRITION:One 8.3 ounce can of The Switch Black Cherry contains:* 130 calories* 15 mg sodium*35 g carbs (33 g sugar)So keep in mind while it has no added sugar it still has the sugar content from its ingredients.  It has more calories than a can of Coke Classic!  It does not have any corn syrup or added sugars though.It also contains 100% of the recommended level of Vitamin C.PRICE:The product costs more than soda, but the ingredients are better.  It costs a little less than Knudsen's Black Cherry Spritzer product.  I use this comparison because the Knudsen product is similar in taste and basic content (filtered sparkling water, fruit concentrate), but a little different in ingredients (no acerola, using pear, pineapple and plum instead), with The Switch having a slight bit more carbs and sugars.Overall, this is a tasty drink.  It is somewhere between a soda and a health drink, definitely better for you than a soda, but not quite as ""natural"" as say all natural juices.  However, if you want a carbonated drink, The Switch is better for you than soda. ANSWERNOTFOUND",15 mg sodium*35 g carbs,"(1216, 1239)"
B004K00DGC,unpleasant,How was the taste?,"I have mixed opinions of this product. On the one hand, it has only 90 calories and 20 grams of sugar, has as much caffeine as an average cup of coffee, and has no artificially-produced ingredients. Additionally, while this doesn't taste like juice, it has a very strong apple flavor which makes it taste better than many other low-calorie energy drinks. For some reason I did not ""feel"" a strong caffeine effect after drinking this. And while the drink tasted sweet, the Stevia sweetener left a very bitter aftertaste.

B004JRMG98,spicy,How is the sauce?,"I have actually tried all three new Taco Bell Sauces, the Jalape&ntilde;o which I am reviewing now, and also the Spicy Ranchero and the Chipotle sauces.Of the three, the Jalapeno is my least favorite because it has the flavor that seems to miss the mark.  It's got a little spice in a creamy base but it just doesn't seem to mesh together well.  Maybe because it's refridgerated and if it's going to be creamy and spicy I'd prefer to have it warm.  It just does not seem to work well and I can't figure out what food this sauce would taste best with.  The label says to use it on Taco Salads and tacos and things like that.  And you could use it on fries.... but I am not sure that it would taste all that great considering there are so many other options.  I would urge you to try one of the other two new Taco Bell sauce flavors first, the Spicy Ranchero or the Chipotle.  Both of those were much better in my opinion.The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle.

I really enjoyed Switch Soda .its something different. Taking juice, putting some carbonation in it. Almost in a vague way reminds me of those sparkling grape juice drinks you get around the holidays if you don't drink wine. Its very good. I would definitely buy it again. However the no sugar added part can be a bit ""misleading"" as you as the label states 33 grams per serving but it's only one serving per can but us diabetics should probably only drink this when we have low sugars like I just did bonus is no high fructose corn syrup which isn't very good anyhow. I liked this and would buy more to keep around the house the days I have my sugar lows as It didn't seem to be to overpowering to me. I liked the kiwi,berry as I am a fan of strawberry and kiwi both. I thought personally it was a very interesting soft drink . I really like this infusion stuff they have these days like Dr pepper put  cherry. chocolate diet one year ago and such.

B003GTR8IO,good,What is the quality of the blend?,"For me, half the pleasure of a good cup of coffee is the aroma while it's brewing. Since I love the scent of anything ""vanilla,"" I decided to tryStarbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2). With this special blend, Starbucks promises ""a subtle flavor and pleasant aroma.""I looked forward to having it before breakfast yesterday, so was pleasantly surprised to wake up to a most delightful vanilla bouquet. That flavor called out to me, so I followed my nose straight to the kitchen where my friend Lynn was quietly reading the newspaper and sipping a cup. She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say ""Thanks,"" she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch! She knows I generally add different flavors of creamer to my coffee, too, but I had wanted to test the ""subtleness"" promised in the ad--without any additives. Anyway, it was delicious with the creamer and I was pleased with the product.My true test of this natural fusions blend came this morning when I indulged myself by trying it a la naturale... Oh, my! What a taste treat! ""Wow,"" I thought, ""this is real coffee!"" The vanilla was just the right amount to blend with the other natural flavors for a perfect cup of coffee. It pleases my palate as well as my olfactory senses... Can't beat that!As an additional test, I brewed a pot for another friend who generally enjoys stronger coffee. Although he liked it, he said it wasn't strong enough for him. So, if you like very strong coffee, this might not be the blend for you...or perhaps I should have added more coffee per cup. But then that would have been for him, not for me. And just how far should I go for a friend? Hmmmm...I have the open bag of coffee beside me as I type this review.

Vanilla is my favorite, so when I got a chance to try this vanilla flavored coffee, I did it.It seems to me that every vanilla flavored coffee I've tried in the past did not really have a smooth vanilla flavor that I hoped for, and this one is no different. The vanilla doesn't seem to stand out or on its own. To me, the only way I can describe it is that the vanilla tastes ""burnt.""As a comparison, I tried adding Torani french vanilla syrup to my regular coffee. I liked that better. I think adding any type of vanilla flavor to regular coffee would produce a similar or better taste than buying it with the flavor already in it. So, is it really necessary to buy premixed vanilla flavored coffee?Maybe a coffee connoisseur would be a better judge of this coffee, but to me, the occassional flavored coffee drinker, this would seem a waste of money, especially since I doubt I'll use the whole package.

B007JFXWRC,bit bland,How is the taste?,"I am a tea drinker and love to try new varieties of tea. The Blackberry Vanilla from Lipton is a lovely, naturally decaf tea. I love the Pyramid tea bags and do think they make a difference when brewing herbal teas. Herbal tea (which actually contains no tea at all) generally has larger pieces of the ingredients than traditional black or green teas. The pyramid shape of the tea bag allows those pieces more room to spread through the water so the infusion of flavor is stronger.The Blackberry Vanilla tea is a beautiful purple color which is actually from the hibiscus not the blackberry (although I'm sure the blackberry does contribute some of the color). Despite the name the hibiscus is also the dominate flavor which is true of most herbal infusions. The blackberry and vanilla flavors are undercurrents and I wish these flavors had been a bit more prominent.Overall I enjoyed the Lipton Blackberry Vanilla tea and I'm sure it will be a variety that I will purchase in the future.

The package is easily portable, does not require refrigeration and easily microwaves in a mere minute.  Simply pull back the cover to the marked line, microwave, then pour the sauce on the pasta.  Although the packaging indicates that the microwaved product will be hot, my finished product was just right - not scalding hot like most microwave meals tend to come out.  But then, I used an 800 watt microwave.But when all is said and done, the product is edible and not much more.  The ""meat"" sauce contains small traces of something that could be meat, but I'd need a microscope to be sure.  The sauce itself is a bit too bland to cover up the odd taste of the pasta itself (which said pasta stubbornly refuses to stay on the fork).  And even if you enjoy the meal, you'll only be able to do so for about five or six bites.  While the portion size may be the ""proper"" size for what people actually need, I don't think that most people, especially men, will find the portion size satisfying or hunger abating for long (although, to be fair, it's no smaller than most such single-serving microwave meals).Overall, I would have expected better from Barilla (which I swear by for most pasta needs), but if you're doing a working lunch and just need to get some quick sustenance, this will do as well as anything.

B003GTR8IO,as good,What does this taste like to you?,"Having lived my entire life in the great state of Louisiana, I've always been partial to local coffee brands such as Community Coffee and Mello Joy.  I try to make a point of buying these local brands for the simple fact that the money stays in Louisiana and both of them taste very good.  To me, Starbucks has always been an overpriced and overhyped brand with a brilliant marketing strategy that put them on the map.  Still, I sometimes visit the local Starbucks for a frappucino or even an Earl Grey latte when I have a bit of extra spending money on hand.I picked up Starbucks' Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, via the Vine program.  I have to admit that it's a very good coffee as far as flavored coffees go.  The scent of the vanilla intertwined with the coffee hits you before you even open the bag, but do not use that as a device of judgement until after you've brewed a few cups of this coffee.As I've already said, the smell of vanilla is strong, but the actual vanilla flavor is very slight.  In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.  The vanilla flavor was miniscule.With one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, I found that the vanilla flavor stood out a bit more, but was still fairly weak.  The overall taste of the coffee was good, though.With two teaspoons of cream and sugar, the vanilla came into its own a bit more, but could not overtake the coffee's taste itself.Overall, this is a coffee drinker's flavored coffee.  If you want a fuller, sweeter vanilla taste and less coffee taste, look elsewhere.  If you only drink flavored coffees as a treat but prefer the taste of medium to dark roast coffee alone, this brew will be right up your alley.I personally enjoyed this coffee, and plan to buy more of it soon.

There's just so much you can do to transform yet another boneless, skinless chicken breast into an interesting dish.  Now, imagine adding the complexity of a very sweet raspberry jam fused with smokey chipotle peppers.  It may be a strange sounding combination, but it works very well with certain foods.The bottle has an attached recipe card providing suggestions for use. Some of the recipes are quite good!  We tried this sauce on pork tenderloin with a rosemary and thyme rub.  That turned out well!  The recipe for the smoked turkey wrap is also quite good.  It certainly provides zing to a boring chicken breast.  As others have mentioned, it's great with cream cheese and crackers.On the other hand, we found the sauce was too sweet with grilled steak, although it probably would work very well with beef in a stir fry.  We also thought the flavors were overpowering with fish.A tablespoon is one serving that has zero fat, but 40 calories and 10g carbs. (The first ingredient is sugar.) For those with allergy considerations, there is a warning on the label that this is ""Manufactured in a facility that processes peanuts, tree nuts, milk, fish, soy, wheat and eggs.""For a condiment, this sauce is expensive.

I admit that it does have a nice, enticing aroma and the combination of these two ingredients sounds appealing, both for the potential flavor and for the settling effects on the stomach. However, the taste of this beverage is not what I expected. It doesn't taste as natural as I thought it would and it has a certain harshness that is most evident in the back of the throat. I followed the directions and added a cup of hot water, but considering the harsh flavor, perhaps I should have used more water.Among the flavors present, the ginger is the one most noticeable and it's the spicy finish that creates that harshness. I was able to finish mine off by taking only small sips at a time, but I can understand why some would have a difficult time drinking this instant beverage. My enjoyment of spicy foods and drinks made it a little more tolerable for me, but I would bet that others would have a difficult time consuming this drink.Ginger and lemons might be a nice combination, but they don't mesh very well in this instance.

So everything except the salmon was great so maybe the other products in that line are better.The only other thing I'd add is that this is definitely a snack and not a meal.  So, all told, I am not sure it's worth it for the kind of price they're asking. ANSWERNOTFOUND",the fruit and nut mix was great,"(306, 337)"
B004BKHX1Y,bland,How is the consistency of cracker?,I never would have thought that apple and cinnamon would go so well in a graham cracker... but I was wrong. The apple and cinnamon flavor isn't overwhelming... it's just right. The crackers are nice and crispy with a great texture. Go good with milk too! ANSWERNOTFOUND,The crackers are nice,"(177, 198)"
B000FEH8ME,more,How was protein ?,"My daughter and I liked these bars.  The texture is a bit odd, kinda gritty but that's probably the healthy stuff swirling through! ANSWERNOTFOUND",probably the healthy,"(87, 107)"
B001FA1SSM,good,Where did you buy the fruit bar?,"I tried the cereal dry first. The dried fruit was bitter not sweet and the cereal had this odd sweet flavor to it. I waited until the next morning to try it with milk and it was ok, I guess. I didn't care for it. I dought I would buy it in the store or online. ANSWERNOTFOUND",buy it in the store,"(230, 249)"
B00DBSG77S,great,How did you like the packaging?,"First,I love that they don't make me fingers orange! White cheddar. The white isn't as bad. The flavor is perfect for a salty, cheese snack. It's very easy to snack on some and then seal the lid. I wish they madea giants tub like this, because closing the plastic bag in the big box never closes completely.Kids and adults will love this, as everyone in my house finished it off quickly....finger licking good! This is my favorite, no more orange ones for me! ANSWERNOTFOUND",because closing the plastic bag in the box never closes completely,"(236, 306)"
B000W2DSO6,small,How is the packet?,"I am an admitted tea and coffee snob but was looking for a product that I can travel with and also prepare in different ways. I normally use Nescafe Classic Freeze Dried coffee when using instant coffee but these new packets of Taster's Choice are so convenient, travel well, are easily opened, dissolve completely and the taste is quite satisfactory for a freeze dried product.  I have prepared it hot, cold (iced) and used it in coffee flavored ice cream drinks.  NESCAF&Eacute; TASTER'S CHOICE is made with a blend of Robusta and Arabica beans. That is, just real beans used to make real coffee then the coffee itself is freeze dried for your convenience.Here is my recipe for iced coffee - I prefer milk in mine...2 tablespoons hot water1 packet of NESCAF&Eacute; TASTER'S CHOICE Instant Coffee GranulesIce cubes6 oz.cold water or milk1 tablespoon sugar (optional)Combine hot water, sugar, if desired and coffee granules in tall glass; stir until coffee is dissolved.

ANSWERNOTFOUND",these new packets of Taster 's Choice are so convenient,"(207, 261)"
B0026ZYZ7Q,enjoyable,Is this taste enjoyable?,"I'm a tea junkie. I compulsively buy bag and loose leaf looking for new and interesting flavors (for reference, my preferred brands are: Rishi, Republic of Tea, Two Leaves and a Bud, and Revolution).Unfortunately, I find that Numi's Cardamom Pu'erh to have little taste and aroma. It's like slightly flavored water.I would not recommend buying. ANSWERNOTFOUND",It 's like slightly flavored water,"(281, 314)"
B001LG940E,delicious,Does this drink is delicious?,"These 8.3 oz cans of Switch keep their promise. There are no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It is a carbonated all natural 100% juice. Like most of these `juices drinks' the ingredients state 100% Juice in this order; Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, (Apple, Grape, Acerola, and Cherry Juice Concentrates), Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). I was surprised to see Cherry as the last listed juice concentrate. Each can has 130 calories, 15mg of sodium, 35g of carbohydrates, 33g of sugar and 100% of RDA of Vitamin C. This sparkling juice tasted good as you drank it, has an identifiable taste of cherry, but it has a very unpleasant after taste. This after taste is enough for me to not want to try this again. I did enjoy theThe Switch Kiwi Berry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)flavor. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Like most of these ` juices drinks,"(154, 187)"
B004DP0DGO,sweet,Why is granola sweet?,"Back to Nature Oat Vanilla Almond Agave Granola is a delicious new entrant into the competitive whole food low glycemic index more protein lots of fiber breakfast market.  The organic food movement is growing in popularity, and it is becoming simpler for consumers to navigate their way through the various products.  Back to Nature doesn't pump up its products with a lot of hype, and prides itself on producing quality whole foods while supporting environmental causes.  But, how does this granola taste?For vanilla lovers, there is nothing not to like.  The vanilla is subtle, but present.Sweetness:  sweetened with agave, which is sweeter than sugar with a lower GI, the balance is good in this granola.  Interestingly, there is also sugar, pure cane juice, and brown rice syrup contributing to the sweetness.Texture:  Crunchy without oiliness.  Anybody who has eaten a high fat granola will know what I mean. The crunchiness holds up well in milk.  When eaten as a snack, it could actually be annoying to your coworkers.Nutrition:  each one half cup serving gives you 200 calories, 7 grams fiber, 5 grams protein and lower fat than most granola.  Compared toBear Naked Fit Vanilla Almond Crunch Granola, 12-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)this granola stacks up pretty well with fewer calories and more fiber.  There is more protein in the bear naked.The bottom line:  this granola is tasty and crunchy.  It is nutritionally complete. But in the end, your granola should be chosen by taste!  Back to Nature has come up with a tasty recipe.  Highly recommended. ANSWERNOTFOUND",which is sweeter than sugar,"(626, 653)"
B00DGPCI56,delicious,What do you think about almond?,"These almonds are coated with a powdery chocolate-looking substance. Unfortunately, they are very sweet, but the chocolate flavor is missing.The almonds were sweet and fresh, but if I'm going to eat this many calories I want a rich chocolate taste, and this one didn't have it. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The almonds were sweet and fresh,"(141, 173)"
B005XVZKGA,clean,How to get a clean taste?,"Just like different brands of regular bottled waters have their own taste to them, so does this avitae. It reminds me of the most un-softened water you can think of. It tastes a lot like the water we get straight from the tap here in Northern Minnesota (we have really good water). I don't drink coffee at all, next to no soda at all and basically just drink black tea and water. So any caffeine I get usually has to be in the form of a hot cup of tea, not always the best beverage for warm summer days. With this avitae, I can have a cold bottled water on hot days and still get an energy lift from caffeine. Also if you decide you want to liven up the water a little, you can add a few drops of drink mix to it to turn it into whatever kind of drink you want. Mixes likeMIO Strawberry Watermelon,Crystal Light On The Go Natural Lemonade PacketsandVitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punchwould be perfect to have on hand in case you're out and want to give your caffeinated water a boost of flavor. I love this stuff, and will be ordering more! ANSWERNOTFOUND","Just like different brands of regular bottled waters have their own taste to them , so does this avitae","(0, 102)"
B005XVZKGA,pure,How is the taste?,"As bottled water goes, this product is about as good as you'll find.  The concern of many will obviously be the impact of caffeine on the taste, but given that there's less than a tenth of a gram, the taste is not affected in the least.  The water itself is clean and refreshing, and I have not noticed any aftertaste.The caffeine content is under 100mg, or about half of what you'd find in a regular brew cup of Starbucks.  You may notice a small boost, but it's not going to be of the variety that makes you wired or shaky.  I have found that it's a good drink for those early afternoons to fend off tiredness without having to worry about the caffeine/sugar crash you often get from coffee.The only issue I have with the product is its pricing, which in a 12-pack works out to about $1.50 per bottle.  I understand that caffeine has to be added, but 100mg of caffeine costs only a few pennies so that shouldn't lead to such high prices.  I don't mind $1.50 for a single bottle, but in a 12 or 24-pack the cost should be a little more attractive.  It has nice packaging and the quality of the bottle is higher than in many other bottled waters, but I would sacrifice a little of that to save some money.Cost concerns aside, this is a good-tasting water that also has some side benefits.  Definitely worth trying as a healthier alternative for coffee, for those in need of a caffeine boost. ANSWERNOTFOUND",this is a good - tasting water,"(1226, 1254)"
B004AFODLI,moist,How is the cake?,I go through stages where i seek out different alternatives to regular mass market products and look instead for artisinal or just somewhat unorthodox alternatives.  sometimes it works out and other times i end up with a cabinet full of stuff that noone in the house will touch.this time it worked great.this mix is an excellent change from the standard big brand pancake mixes (haven't used it for waffles).  the flapjacks have an excellent consistency and taste great.  i've actually noticed the whole family uses less syrup with this mix than our old stand by which produced pancakes that weren't much more than syrup delivery vehicles.  the cakes are moist and delicious. ANSWERNOTFOUND,the cakes are moist and delicious,"(641, 674)"
B002DM62BY,perfect,What are the perfect blends?,"I was a little hesitant to try this blend because a lot of times when you buy mixes in the store, you mostly get 3/4 of a bag of peanuts and very little of the other ingredients. However, there are equal amounts of all listed ingredients. In addition, they are gluten-free. I also liked the type of ingredients in the mix, which are some of my favorites: almonds, cashews, raisins, dried apples (that I almost mistook for pineapples) and pistachios.The package is easy to open. While this may sound minimal, while you're on the road or running around doing errands and need a quick snack, it is quite irritating to not be able to open a package -- especially when you're hungry!As a side note, my birds love it too! They are picky eaters.It is also great for those that need portion control. Since trail mix calories can add up quickly if you have a large bag, I like that this is a portioned size. I also like that it is high in protein.My only complaint is that it is a bit expensive and amounts to just over $1 per package. Maybe it's just me, but I find that a little too expensive. There isn't a lot in the packs that I think they should cost $1 each.However, they taste absolutely delicious. By far, they are the best snack/trail mix I have had in a long time, if ever. So I am extremely satisfied with the quality and taste of the product.I would highly recommend this product. There are other flavors as well. I would like to try some of the others as well. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I was a little hesitant to try this blend because a lot of times when you buy mixes in the store,"(0, 96)"
B001FA1SSM,more,How is the sugar?,"This is some of the best cereal I have eaten. The flakes are BOLD and able to hold their own in milk, the last bite was as crunchy as the first. The fruit softens up nicely in milk and the blackberries were wonderful! It was just sweet enough, not overpowering. And, the best thing of all, one serving (yes, using the right size and not adding a little ""extra"") filled me up, really. I tend to not have cereal for breakfast because it takes two or three large bowls to fill me up, but this was perfect. It is also nice to know that it has no artificial ingredients. If I had to say something negative, it would be that the box LOOKS green but did not have the ""green"" label. I will be restocking my pantry with this one - thanks for listening when we asked for a natural breakfast product! ANSWERNOTFOUND",It was just sweet enough not overpowering,"(218, 260)"
B004JGQ15E,delicious,What about snack ?,"I love the combination of chocolate with caramel corn and the Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Carmel Popcorn provided just the right balance of that combination.  The chocolate didn't overwhelm the flavor of the caramel corn.  The popcorn tasted fresh and the caramel coating has a good flavor.Caramel corn is one of those snacks that never seems to fill me up so I love that this is packaged in individual serving bags.  I can eat one bag and satisfy my craving for a sweet snack without eating an entire box of caramel corn.  At 130 calories and 18 grams of sugar per bag, it isn't a great diet snack but a nice treat once in a while.  In comparison, original Crunch 'n Munch has 160 calories and 11 grams of sugar in a similar serving size. ANSWERNOTFOUND",Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Carmel,"(62, 92)"
B002IEVJRY,not sweet,How is it the drink?,"I love coffee and continue to drink it occasionally even though I have a sensitivity to caffeine these days. It took me THREE mornings to finish this tiny 6.8-ounce can, about 2 ounces a day to where I was feeling that buzz. This stuff is strong. It's billed as a coffee drink, but it really is more of an espresso, so keep that in mind. I appreciated that the caffeine content was listed on the can, 152 mg, which is higher than a lot of coffee, which tends to be 100 to 120 mg per serving.It definitely has a strong coffee taste, with no sweetness at all, not even an artificial sweetener. With only the three ingredients, it's your basic straight-up stuff. ANSWERNOTFOUND",This stuff is strong,"(225, 245)"
B001LG940E,perfect,How is the size?,"First, this is a household that VERY rarely drinks soda of any type due to health concerns and a deliberate decision to eradicate soda from our diets. Having said that, there are times when you really would like a soda. The Switch soda seems to fit the bill as a soda alternative...no sugar, no preservatives and no artificial sweeters - just carbonated fruit juice. So far so good. The taste is pretty good and quite comprable to ""unhealthy"" sodas - to the point that my other half didn't think it was healthy at all...he liked the flavor very well.The only reason ths didn't get a full five stars is the size is relatively small...something I personally didn't mind because I actually like the size and shape a LOT but spouse didn't...he felt it was just far too small...and the price. AT roughly $1 per can, this is considerably higher priced than a regular soda - however, in keeping with other healthy alternatives.Pro's -Good taste (can't tell this is healthy) that isn't ""over the top""Nice level of carbonation - just rightHealthy alternative to a standard sodaCon's -PriceDebates -Size - 1 liked size other didn't like size (wanted larger size)Bottom line...I would probably purchase this if the price was lower but being a non-soda drinker would be unlikely to add this to my shopping list at this price. I probably would buy it via a vending machine when out and about and wanting an alternative to plain bottled water or soda (which I dont drink). ANSWERNOTFOUND",size is relatively small,"(606, 630)"
B00C7MGHVA,medicinal,Why does it have a medicinal taste?,"I love my Keurig but when it comes to tea, I am a bit of a tea snob. I decided to see how these tea k-cups compare to steeping a cup of tea from a teabag. I must say I prefer the teabag mostly because of the huge difference in price. The Lipton K-cups are nice and convenient and even have a good flavor but the price per cup is much higher. There is a bit of sweetener after taste with these k-cups. I will stick to teabags and being able to control my own sweetener in my tea. ANSWERNOTFOUND",have a good flavor,"(285, 303)"
B001LGGH40,refresh,How is the drink?,"I don't often drink soda for a couple reasons...  it's all high fructose corn syrup and various artificial flavors (and the diet stuff has even worse stuff.)  With that said:  this stuff is good.It doesn't leave that weird aftertaste in your mouth, or that sticky slime in the back of the throat (or is that just me?), or BURN going down.  It tastes ""fresh,"" for lack of a better term.  Containing 100% fruit juice is a huge step forward for a soft drink - not really because it's going to supply you with a serving of fruit or anything, but because it's actually FOOD.  (Corn syrup + some contrived chemical flavoring of other soft drinks, in my book, is not food.)All in all, this is good, has a great flavor, and just has a ""cleaner"" flavor that the sugary/corn-syrupy stuff.  (I didn't really notice it being too sweet.  To comment on other reviews saying it's mostly other fruit juices...it's because apple and grape juice are incredibly sweet.  Other fruits are usually used as flavoring, not as sweeteners.  A strawberry (or kiwi) may taste sweet when eaten whole, but the juice by itself really isn't sweet enough to be passed off as ""juice,"" except by fanatics.)Overall, I would recommend to anyone who wants a good tasting natural soda.  I liked it enough to want to try out the other flavors... ANSWERNOTFOUND",it 's all high fructose corn syrup and various artificial flavors,"(50, 114)"

B006MONQMC,large,What is the quality of the bottle?,"I've been a loyal Mio customer since I first spotted it months ago. I love the ease of amazing flavored water drinks. Although I loved the convenience, the small size and high price was always a little bothersome.Enter Vitamin Squeeze!  The bottle is huge.  It will last many times longer than a small bottle of Mio.The flavor is lovely. It really tastes fruity-not like a kids fake fruit flavored drink. I like that theres plentyof vitamin C. Not crazy about the ""natural caffeine"" but I can overlook that.  Hopefully other favors will come caffeine free.One thing to point out-the bottle is much easier to squeeze than Mio.  The first glass ended up making a mess and too much came out.  User error and easily corrected.If you like Mio or even crystal light mixes, give this a try. I was very impressed and will definitely be buying more. ANSWERNOTFOUND",The bottle is huge,"(237, 255)"
B003YBH398,good,How do you like the box?,"I found the GoPicnic Sunbutter and Cracker box to be a great find! How I would've loved these when my children were smaller. But, I can still appreciate them now. The package is all neatly packed in a little box. There's no high fructose corn syrup, MSG or trans fat. It has a few fun food facts and a Sudoku puzzle on the bottom of the box. Here's a breakdown of the goodies:Sunbutter Spread: Tasted just like peanut butter; smooth texture. (It is peanut-free) It comes in a handy squeezable package to put on the crackers.Crunchmaster Multi-Grain Crackers:  Healthy gluten-free crackers that have a nice crunch. They're loaded with seeds: sesame, flax, millet and quinoa. These were great with the Sunbutter.Seed and Fruit: No nuts! This has sunflower kernels, pumpkin seeds, raisins, apple pieces, chocolate chips and cranberries. I plan to stash some of these in my purse for a fast snack when my blood sugar is low.Peel-A-Part Tropical Fruit: This was a big surprise to me that I liked it so much! Four pieces to peel apart with great flavor of apple, mango, and pineapple. I don't normally like fruit leather type snacks, but this was great.Double Chocolate Crunchy Cookie: I love chocolate, but prefer a soft cookie. Again, something I didn't think I would like that well and it was delicious. Light and crunchy with a great flavor and it's also gluten-free. You'll find a coupon on the package for 75 cents off a box of these cookies.All and all this was very convenient and healthy. We're planning an overnight trip to the coast and these snacks are going with us for the whole family to enjoy. I plan to order more! Great idea! I would think this is especially good for people with allergies to nuts and MSG. ANSWERNOTFOUND",I found the GoPicnic Sunbutter and Cracker box to be a great find,"(0, 65)"
